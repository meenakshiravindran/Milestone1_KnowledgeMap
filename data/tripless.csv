"A painter who hears noise in colors. A musician who sees sounds in shapes. People who taste words. These are just some examples of what it’s like to have synesthesia ― a condition where input received via one sense triggers a response from another sense, causing people to experience reduced boundaries between vision, hearing and other types of perception.  Now, a study published Sept. 15 in the European Journal of Neuroscience suggests that simply having one type of synesthesia ― for example, seeing colors in letters of the alphabet ― is enough to blur the lines between other senses as well. “It shows that something about their synesthesia is spilling over into another domain,” Dr. Krish Sathian, a neurologist at Emory University, said in a press release. The findings may help researchers pin down the exact cause of synesthesia, which remains mysterious. Are the brains of people with synesthesia wired differently from everyone else’s? Or are they simply ordinary brains doing what ordinary brains do, only more intensely? We don’t yet have enough data to say for sure, but the new research suggests it may be the latter. Most people, even those without synesthesia, make some implicit associations between different sensory features. We describe people’s voices as “sharp” or “soft” as if they’re things we can touch. Or we talk of painting a room in “warm” colors. One famous example of these so-called cross-modal correspondences is the Bouba-Kiki effect, first observed by the psychologist Wolfgang Köhler in 1929. Experiments have shown that no matter what language someone speaks, he or she is more likely to assign the name “bouba” to a round-cornered shape and the name “kiki” to an angular shape than the other way around. “Some argue that these phenomena form a continuum, with classical synesthesia being an exaggeration of universal cross-modal correspondences,” the researchers note in this week’s paper. “Others contend that the two are quite different.”  The people in the study had the most common form of synesthesia ― a type known as grapheme-color synesthesia, which causes people to perceive colors in letters and numbers. But during tests, the researchers found that these people are also more likely than their non-synesthete peers to make associations between shapes and meaningless words. “We conclude that synesthesia heightens universally experienced cross-modal correspondences,” the researchers said. Synesthesia is thought to be rare, but estimates are highly variable and unclear. Anecdotally the condition has been linked to creativity, with some research backing it up. One study in Australia found 24 percent of synesthetes to be involved in an artistic profession. Among the general population, this figure falls to just 2 percent. It may be possible to learn synesthesia, by consciously trying to associate different sensory modalities, to improve your memory and creativity. And some researchers argue that true synesthetes, too, have learned the associations during childhood. One study last year found a link between the colors that some people see in letters and the colors of a popular brand of refrigerator magnets.  That might be hard for synesthetes to believe, however, since they often perceive the letters in highly irregular, complex and almost otherworldly hues. ",brains,are,what
"Harvey Weinstein is the latest man who has been caught in a sex scandal, allegedly using his power to abuse and harass women. Weinstein, a film producer, joins the likes of Roger Ailes, Bill O’Reilly, Donald Trump and others who have been accused of sexual harassment. But instead of analyzing how these men had been able to reportedly abuse women without repercussions for decades, the media wants to know why Hillary Clinton hasn’t commented.     I felt like I was in an episode of “The Twilight Zone” reading major publications and tweets from mainstream pundits like CNN’ s Chris Cillizza who wants to know why Clinton wasn’t speaking out. Since the election, these same people who said Hillary should go away quietly are now wondering why she hasn’t come forward about allegations against Harvey Weinstein. They want her to shut up except when they don’t.     Harvey Weinstein is a pig. The allegations against him are disgusting. Full stop.  There aren’t a bunch of Democrats claiming otherwise or making excuses that it was just “locker room” talk.  But this is some new level hypocrisy on part of the Republicans who are clutching their pearls about Weinstein when they just elected a man who said he liked to grab women by the p***y and walk in on teenage beauty pageants contestants while they are dressing. So many Fox News stars have been accused of sexual harassment that I assumed something was in the water at Fox headquarters. Fox News has paid millions to accusers, and yet they are pretending that Weinstein’s offensive behavior is something they’ve never seen before. Even Donald Trump, Jr. tweeted about it which, demonstrates lack of self-awareness is genetic and incurable. I’m not here to defend Weinstein. Again, the allegations against him are atrocious. What I’m trying to understand is what the hell does Hillary have to do with any of this? She’s not running for office. She’s not married to Weinstein.  Why all of a sudden does the media who wanted her to shut up when she was on her book tour now want to tie this anchor around her neck?   First, Hillary was blamed for Bill Clinton’s affairs by both sides; the people who thought she didn’t do enough to keep her husband and the people who thought she stayed in her marriage too long and should have left him. Then, James Comey put the dagger in her campaign by tying Hillary to Anthony Weiner’s sexting teenage girls. And now, this. Bill Clinton was the one who committed the affairs but he is more popular than ever. Bill O’Reilly still has a platform. And Donald Trump actually got elected even with the “Access Hollywood” tape. The “boys will be boys” mentality not only applies to boys but men who are in their freaking 70s.   Ever since Eve was blamed for “tempting” Adam, women have been blamed for the vile stuff men do. It’s a tradition as old as time, blaming women and wondering what the women did to make the man do [insert behavior here]. So I shouldn’t be surprised at the calls for Hillary, of all people, to speak out. It is still infuriating. Hopefully, Hillary will just brush off this latest attack and carry on with her book tour. Despite what Chris, Fox News and Donald Trump, Jr. say, Hillary doesn’t have to answer for associating with Weinstein. And if people are outraged over Weinstein but voted for Donald Trump, they can just shut up and take a seat. Clearly, they aren’t worth responding to anyway.",who,joins,harassment
"If “The Handmaid’s Tale” is where we’re going, “Alias Grace” is where we came from. So says Sarah Polley, the writer and producer behind the new Netflix adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1996 novel. The work of historical fiction revolves around the titular Grace Marks, a 19th-century servant accused of brutally murdering the master of her household and his mistress, a fellow housekeeper, with the help of a stablehand. The real-life crime rocked Upper Canada in 1843, hurling the Victorian community into a salacious trial that amounted to a life sentence for Marks and a hanging for her accomplice. After 30 years in prison, Grace was eventually pardoned, but her exoneration was a mere consolation prize after decades of living as a notorious woman. “Murderess is a strong word to have attached to you,” Marks says in Atwood’s book. “It has a smell to it, that word ― musky and oppressive, like dead flowers in a vase. Sometimes at night I whisper it over to myself: Murderess, murderess. It rustles, like a taffeta skirt across the floor.” Polley brought the beloved Atwoodian tale to life with the help of acclaimed “American Psycho” director Mary Harron. Together, they created a six-episode miniseries that places Marks, expertly played by Sarah Gadon, as its center of gravity. She at times appears powerless, the product of poverty and neglect forced into an unforgiving life of servitude, and at other times as a careless and deliberate enigma, driven by an internal force we’ve yet to understand. Is she a cold-blooded killer, or a unduly scorned castaway? Both Atwood and the Polley-Harron adaptation team shy away from answering that question. Instead, the new Netflix series is at its best when it sinks into the historic details that complicate Marks’ narrative. In the show’s meticulously crafted world, an echo of real 19th-century horrors, lower-class women are relegated to sexual prey, cast as the constant targets of unwanted advances and the unfortunate recipients of botched abortions. Indeed, if “Handmaid’s Tale” is the fundamentalist dystopia of our future, “Alias Grace” makes it its mission to paint a clear picture of the overlooked history that would make Gilead possible. We spoke to Harron ahead of the show’s premiere on Nov. 3. and she echoed Polley’s unnerving parallel between both hair-raising Atwood adaptations, and explained what it was like bringing the story of Grace Marks to life. What initially drew you to the adaptation of Alias Grace?  Well, I hadn’t read the novel. I knew nothing about the story going in, I had no preconceptions about it. But it’s such a fantastic plot. You get totally drawn into this world. I’ve always loved ambiguity and mystery, and also a female character who suffers a lot but isn’t conventionally, like, “Oh, poor Grace.” She’s very complicated. Is she good? Is she bad? Have the things she’s suffered turned her into a murderer? All of these things. I was very drawn into the world right away. Were you a Margaret Atwood fan before this? Yeah, I’m Canadian, so of course. I was also at university in the ’70s when her first novels started coming out. Or, at least, that’s when I started discovering them. She had a big impact on feminism at the point ― of that generation. I was very affected by the stories that she was telling. But I hadn’t read her most recent stuff. So it was a real revelation. [Alias Grace] is actually my favorite Margaret Atwood novel now. The novel is based on a real crime that happened in Canada in the 1840s. Were you aware of the story of Grace Marks at all? I read a couple reviews of [Atwood’s] book when it came out, but I had never heard of [Marks]. It was very mysterious. I’ve done a lot of period drama ― my first film [“I Shot Andy Warhol”] was the 1960s, “Bettie Page” was the 1950s, “American Psycho” was the 1980s. I studied literature at university ― I’m pretty steeped in the Victorian novel ― so I always wanted to do a period drama like this. This is a very interesting take on a 19th-century story. The story revolves around perhaps one of the most enigmatic characters Margaret Atwood ever wrote. If you could give your own character description of Grace Marks, what would it be? This is important: She’s a young girl, Protestant, from Northern Ireland. She’s very competent and capable and bright. She’s the sort of person who could have run a corporation, but she’s born into a world of incredible poverty and oppression, and she suffers greatly. She’s quite puritanical, like a lot of Northern Irish Protestants. I can say that, because my family’s from there. She has love in her heart, but the question is: With all her sufferings, did they make her a better person or a worse person? With all the terrible things that she has had to go through, which way did they turn her in the end? I had this conversation with Margaret Atwood. People think that suffering makes you noble, but not always. Sometimes, a lot of suffering can turn you. It can make you vindictive and murderess. You don’t know.  Yes, that’s certainly one of the intriguing aspects of the way Atwood wrote the character. You don’t necessarily know if Grace is the protagonist or the antagonist of the story. And that doesn’t really seem to be the point. There’s not a whole lot of morality to it; it’s simply an interesting character exploration. Yes. It’s a real-life story. Although there’s not a lot known about Grace, there are certain historical records and interviews with people at the time about what happened during those murders. I love real-life stories, because the behaviors are always so contradictory. It’s like ... why? Why didn’t you tell anyone? Why, when the butcher answered the door, didn’t you tell him that [James] McDermott was going to kill someone? You know? It’s funny, when Sarah Gadon and I were going through the script and making notes on the character together, we were like, “Grace, what were you thinking?” You think you know her, Grace. You think you have a line on her, but then there is some piece of the story that puts that out of whack. As with Simon [Jordan] during the drama. Simon is constantly being turned around and bewildered by her, and banging his head against the wall, because you can never quite get a handle on who she is.   During a TIFF masterclass this year, you told audiences that the key to eliciting a standout performance from your actors is “entirely casting.” What was the process like casting Sarah Gadon in the role of Grace? How did you know she was the one? I had worked with her before, six or seven years ago, on a movie called “The Moth Diaries,” in which she was playing 16 [years old], actually. I’d seen hundreds of people for the role I cast her in, and she actually recorded an audition for me on her computer, because she was filming overseas. As soon as I saw her, I thought, this girl is remarkable. When you meet her, she’s sort of an old soul, a very impressive person. And working with her, she’s very subtle. She does what I really like in actors, she does a lot of layers. She makes adjustments very quickly. Even as a young actress who hadn’t done that many movies, she could make these incredible subtle changes and imply a lot going on below the surface. And also, with Grace, you want someone who is very beautiful, but who has a mystery to them, which she has kind of effortlessly. You could really just watch her face for a long time. And with Edward [Holcroft], too. You know, there are these long scenes where they are just sitting in a room talking. You want to be able to linger on their faces. What kind of research did you do before filming ― in terms of reading up on the era and real-life crime? Margaret Atwood had recommended some books. She gave Sarah Polley a sort of book list, and I read one in particular ― a 19th-century woman’s account of traveling through Canada. That was really interesting on the condition of servant girls as sexual prey. It’s always interesting to read contemporary accounts that give the attitudes of the time. Margaret Atwood had done so much research into language. Usually I’m very bothered by period inaccuracies and dialogue anachronisms, but Margaret Atwood has done all the work. She is very authentic, not just in how people talked, but how they thought and behaved. You know, women thought in very different ways [in the 1800s]. Grace saw her life very differently than a woman today sees her life, or sees sexuality, religion, everything.  But in terms of the kind of research I had to do, that was more with the production designer about getting the actual details of the world right. And for Sarah Gadon, she had to learn how to do all this housework! She had to learn how to sew and quilt. I didn’t want her faking, and she didn’t want to either. She’s quilting throughout so many of those conversations, so she had to be so good at it she could do it without looking. And it has to be completely natural. She spent weeks and months learning. Domestic labor is a whole story in that. Watching [Gadon] as Grace, you can actually see calluses on her hands. Right! I was with the makeup department and I was like, “You have to roughen her hands.” She has beautiful hands, you know. So she did some of it herself, and then we had the makeup team roughen them up, too.  You spent time at Ontario’s Kingston Penitentiary, where the real Grace Marks actually spent time during her lifetime. What was it like filming there? That was another interesting thing. When I read the script, the way that they were written, the cell was a much bigger cell. But when we went on our location scout to Kingston Penitentiary, and also to penitentiary’s museum, we saw a reproduction of a prison cell from the 19th century. It was almost a 5-foot coffin, the size of a single bed. And that’s where people would spend half their lives. I was very taken by this, by this idea that [Grace] was buried alive for all these years ― all of the prisoners were. So I had to persuade everybody, because it made it much more difficult to shoot, to make the cell smaller. She could still stand up, because we made it a foot wider. I knew it would be hard to shoot, because we couldn’t get the camera inside the room, but the production designer agreed with me ― this is important and we need to make it real.  The other thing that came out from that museum, which wasn’t actually in the original script or the book, was this thing called “the box,” where they’d put prisoners inside this upright coffin. There’s this scene with Grace where you see her face in a little hole in the wood and she’s screaming. We just saw that box, and I asked Sarah [Polley] to write that in. It’s horrifying. It’s medieval. I mean, the rules ... you get whipped for looking or whispering or if you laugh or smile. It was barbaric, and we wanted to show that for real.  Was that difficult for Sarah Gadon to perform? Did the authentic setting bring a different kind of gravity to the script? I thought it did. It was tough on her. I stepped inside that box to see what it was like and I was like, oh my God, let me out. I wouldn’t force an actress to do it, but I think most actresses who are taking it seriously want to go there and experience some of this. One of my favorite lines from the 1996 NYT review of “Alias Grace” reads: “There’s nothing like the spectacle of female villainy brought to justice to revive the ancient, tired, apparently endless debate over whether women are by nature saintly or demonic.” This is obviously a central theme in Atwood’s book. How did you and Sarah Polley go about bringing this “debate” to light in your adaptation? Sarah Polley has a really great quote about this, about women conforming so much and playing to other people’s expectations of them. Of women playing different roles and playing different people in different circumstances. That’s what she’s referring to in those first few words of the script, when [Grace] says, “People think I’m a female demon. People think I’m a poor innocent victim. People think I’m this and that.” What is the essential woman? Victorian women, especially, have all these images put on them.  I also loved the idea that one woman can be seen and get to portray a character in such different ways, without you knowing which is the real one. That allowed a much more complicated female character. One of the things I love about Margaret Atwood is that she’s never like, “Men are bad and women are good.” She’s writing about harsh social pressures and injustices that don’t always bring out the best in people. Like the relationship between Grace and Nancy [Montgomery], who are both really victims of society, both working-class girls, one of whom is pregnant and has managed to claw a little status for herself. I think Margaret Atwood has this view of women that they can become like rats in a cage ― they can turn on each other, because there’s so little safety for them. That was very truthful, about how tough social settings can bring out competitiveness and rivalries. You would like to think that women are always [supportive], but … What was it like having Margaret Atwood on set? And directing her in a cameo role? Oh, it was fun. I didn’t have to do too much directing. There was a lot of panic because the schedule had gone wrong. It was like the second day of shooting, and she was waiting around in a heavy costume in 90 degree heat for hours and hours. We were like, “Ahhhh.” But she was very good about it. And I think she was very amused, because on her trailer it said, “Difficult Woman.” That was her name in the [episode]. How much, if at all, did she shape the adaptation?  I don’t know, I’m not privy to that. Sarah showed her a lot of the drafts at every stage, I think. I think [Atwood’s] pretty hands off, but Sarah Polley was anxious that it be very faithful, so she ran a lot of it by her.   Obviously the whole show is coming out in the wake of “Handmaid’s Tale” Season 1. If it’s possible for there to be more fandom around Margaret Atwood, now seems to be the time. Many fans saw “Handmaid’s Tale” as an overtly feminist show that inspired a lot of activism. Did you envision “Alias Grace” as an overtly feminist show? It’s feminist in the sense that it’s presenting a neglected and important piece of female history, which is the lives of female servants in a realistic way. The story of Mary Whitney happened to tens of thousands of girls. Hundreds of thousands of girls got pregnant, were raped or were seduced and abandoned, were sexual fodder for upper-class men. And that’s a really neglected part of history, you know, of what these girls’ lives were like.  Sarah Polley said that “Alias Grace” is where we come from, and “Handmaid’s Tale” is where we might go. It’s important politically to know where you come from in an accurate way. The same thing is happening with how we look at slavery or the Confederacy and the Civil War. It’s important for us to dig back and say, “We have certain versions of the past, but are there other versions we need to be aware of?” In this case, there’s a somewhat idealized view of the country house, and the happy servants who love their masters and the masters who care for their servants. Is this true? No! Those servants were unbelievably exploited. Especially the young women, who were sexual prey to all the young men. They’d get pregnant, and that was the end of them. What was it like to get an abortion back then? Well, we’ll show you. It’s not even that long ago, and that’s what our society’s grown out of. We need to remind ourselves of that. I remember when I was living in London there was this idea of returning to Victorian values. Well, those are Victorian values: child labor and young women being thrown out into the streets. That’s our history.  That theme seems particularly relevant in a time when a president wants to “Make America Great Again.” [Laughs] A lot of the time we want to idealize the past, and that can have a political agenda behind it. People idealize the 1950s in America for the same reason ― that was a Reagan thing. Let’s return the ’50s. Well ... segregation. In terms of women’s stories, there a lot of stories that haven’t been told and perspectives that haven’t been shown. “Alias Grace” is not necessarily as obvious a call to action [as “Handmaid’s Tale], but that doesn’t mean it’s not an important perspective. You have a history of showcasing women’s stories. You’ve made films about Valerie Solanas, Bettie Page and Anna Nicole Smith. Are there any other outré women, who might similarly challenge notions of femininity, that you’d be interested in spotlighting in a film? Right now I’m casting for this Manson girls project. The interest there is: How do these seemingly normal, hippy girls end up doing these terrible things? What was their relationship to the cult? Why did they give over their will to this crazy leader? Part of the film is set in the early ’70s, when they are in prison, and part of the story is told from the Manson ranch. People don’t really take an interest in the girls when they tell that story. They don’t really show how it happened ― how they came to do these things. How could they? How did they? What’s the story there? There was this young feminist in her early 30s who came and gave classes to the Manson girls and wrote a book about them. I’m always interested in an untold story. And not just a straightforward story of a noble struggle, but looking at quite complicated issues of female behavior. Can’t get more complicated than the Manson girls. Taking it back a bit, you refused to cast Leonardo DiCaprio in “American Psycho” in part because his fan base at the time consisted of teenagers, and because you’d already tapped Christian Bale. What was it like pushing back on studio executives at the time? Well, I got fired, so that’s what it was like. [Editor’s Note: Harron was eventually reinstated as director of “American Psycho.”] Or you could say I quit, but they fired me because I didn’t want to meet with DiCaprio and I didn’t want to cast him. I’d already said I would cast Christian, who wasn’t famous at the time. Leo was. I think everyone thought I was crazy. There were two things: I thought Leo was a great actor but he wasn’t right for it. Christian was right for it. And I would never make a film if I didn’t think the lead was right. But I also knew that if they brought on the biggest star in the world for “American Psycho,” they’d totally rewrite the script and I would lose control over the tone of it. I also thought it was totally inappropriate for this actor with a huge fan base of young girls to play this role. It just seemed wrong on so many levels. It was an advantage with Christian Bale to have someone who wasn’t as famous, because people didn’t have a lot of preconceptions. His fame didn’t get in the way. I’m very, very specific about casting and I’ve been through many casting battles. I don’t think I’ve been with a film without having a casting battle. It’s the one thing that’s make-or-break for me. I really will not do a film if I don’t think the lead is right for it. No good film was ever made if the lead was miscast. Making a film is hard enough. But Netflix was very good. They said, “You don’t have to cast stars.” And I think this will make a star out of Sarah Gadon. Has it gotten any easier over the course of your career to assert yourself in that arena and have a position of power in these casting dilemmas? No, it really hasn’t. And you’d think it would.   Last question: Why isn’t “I Shot Andy Warhol” available to stream anywhere? I just saw Christine Vachon, the producer, at the premiere of the Todd Haynes movie [“Wonderstruck”], and she said they’re looking into getting the rights back. It’s one of those things, the company that distributed it went out of business. It breaks my heart that that film isn’t available. There are all these great actors in it. Lili Taylor. Justin Theroux’s first film! I would so love to see that film back. So, we’re working on it. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. “Alias Grace” is now streaming on Netflix. ",setting,bring,script
"By David Washburn The two 9th-grade girls heard the laughing the minute they walked into their third-period class that December morning at Oakland’s Fremont High School. And they knew why: a video of one of the girls being slapped by a classmate had gone viral among students on social media. It was one of those moments that could have gone bad in a hurry — like so many others had at Fremont High, a school that had more suspensions last year than any other in the Oakland Unified School District. Both girls (whose names are being withheld to protect their privacy) acknowledged later that their first instinct was to lash out at their snickering classmates. But they didn’t do that. Instead, they left the classroom and walked down the hall to Tatiana Chaterji’s room. Chaterji is Fremont High’s restorative justice facilitator and among a growing number of educators in Oakland Unified charged with changing the district’s approach to behavioral issues through restorative practices. This work departs from traditional school discipline in that it focuses less on punishment and more on righting wrongs and building healthy relationships within the school. During the previous period, the two girls had participated in a community building circle, a cornerstone of restorative justice in which students gather in a circle, talk about the difficulties of their daily lives and work on responding to them in a healthier way. “What would have happened had you stayed (in the classroom)?” Chaterji asked the girls after they had told her their story. “They would have said some things, then I would have said some things…then things could have gotten ugly,” said the more assertive of the two, who was wearing an ankle monitor from the Alameda County Juvenile Probation Department. Had things gotten out of hand, punches might have been thrown. That would’ve led to an office referral and perhaps suspensions. Such an outcome would be an unfortunate but not uncommon occurrence at Fremont, which, according to district data, suspended 151 students during the 2016-17 school year. Fremont High hired Chaterji last summer as part of a larger effort to improve the school’s climate and cut down on suspensions. The school also employs three case managers who work to alleviate conflicts that crop up in classrooms before they become office referrals. “People’s trust in the process is growing,” Chaterji said. “The leadership has really shifted to prioritize [restorative justice]…we are at an exciting moment, but it’s just the start.” A new approach to an old problem Small victories like the one that morning at Fremont High are being won to varying degrees in schools throughout California. Over the past decade, a mountain of research has shown that the so-called zero-tolerance approach to misbehavior, characterized by stringent rules and harsh punishments, largely doesn’t work. In particular, studies have shown unequivocally that students of color are suspended and expelled at disproportionately higher rates than their white peers, which has forced a reassessment of school discipline in many places throughout the nation. Teachers and administrators have come to realize that a student’s range of experiences — their home life, their neighborhood and the overall atmosphere of the school — has an outsized impact on their behavior in class. Research shows that by gaining insight into these experiences and building stronger relationships with students, educators can address a number of behaviors without having to resort to suspensions and other punitive methods of discipline. This awakening, along with intense pressure on districts from the state in recent years to cut down on suspensions, have spawned a number of behavioral support programs under the umbrella of social/emotional learning, including Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports (PBIS) and Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS). Interwoven in these approaches is the idea of restorative justice, which has both captured the imagination of many youth advocates and educators and generated controversy. In recent years, some of the state’s largest districts have made significant investments in restorative justice: Although the terms restorative justice and restorative practices were largely unheard of in the school setting as recently as a decade ago, the work in many respects builds on conflict mediation strategies that schools have used since the 1990s. Yet many see restorative justice as groundbreaking because at its core is a repudiation of the punitive model that has been the foundation of school discipline in this country since the days of the one-room schoolhouse. Because their use in the school setting is so new, there is scant research on the long-term effectiveness of restorative practices. But officials in districts that have devoted significant resources to them say they’ve led directly to fewer suspensions and better school climates. “We have seen a drastic reduction in suspensions and RJ (a commonly used shorthand for the practices) is a big reason for it,” said Deborah Brandy, Los Angeles Unified’s director of district operations, which oversees restorative justice programs. “We’ve also seen a reduction in truancy rates…and it goes beyond the data. Parents feel more welcome at their school sites; students remarked (in climate surveys) that their teachers seem more caring.” While awareness of restorative practices is high among school officials statewide, relatively few districts outside major urban centers have well-established programs, EdSource found through interviews and a survey. The most common sentiment expressed among nearly a dozen superintendents, principals and other officials interviewed was cautious optimism, with the caveat that finding resources to devote to it is a challenge. “There is certainly an interest and heightened awareness,” said Tamara Clay, who is director of the El Dorado County Special Education Local Plan Area. “And system change can be easier in small rural areas like ours — but it’s harder in that our superintendents don’t have the capacity.” Too much too soon? While it is difficult to find anyone — administrators, teachers, students or parents — who disagrees with the core principles of restorative justice, a fair number of critics say it’s been oversold as a quick fix. And, in some instances, they say it’s contributed to more chaotic school environments. Los Angeles Unified’s efforts have drawn criticism from some teachers’ union officials who say the district has launched an aggressive implementation plan without sufficiently taking into account how the timetable is affecting students and teachers at the ground level. “The LAUSD idea is that in three years’ time we’ll just train all the teachers and we’ll be done,” said Daniel Barnhart, who is vice president of secondary schools for United Teachers of Los Angeles. “It is a recipe for resentment and for teachers to not make a change they may want to make because there is no real support.” Belia Saavedra, director of restorative justice in schools for the Long Beach-based California Conference for Equality and Justice (CCEJ), said most teachers she works with embrace restorative justice — but she has encountered pockets of resistance in both Long Beach and Los Angeles schools. “More than a few teachers will tell you that RJ is the removal of punishment without a replacement for accountability,” Saavedra said, referring to concerns that there aren’t sufficient consequences. “If RJ is coming to their school they see it as the wild, wild West.” LA Unified’s Brandy does not dispute the reports of pushback, but says the concerns fade once teachers and administrators see the district’s commitment to the approach. “Because the district has been very steadfast we are getting more and more buy-in,” Brandy said. “In the first year, we received a lot of pushback. In the second year, people started calling me, asking me ‘When am I going to get the RJ training?’” Brandy’s assertions notwithstanding, the issues being raised are real and indicative of the pendulum swinging too quickly away from traditional discipline, argues Max Eden, a senior fellow specializing in education policy for the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank based in New York City. Eden says his research shows that students report feeling less safe when districts issue mandates to reduce suspensions and in their place offer alternatives like restorative justice and PBIS. “There is more immediate evidence that the reforms are creating a crisis rather than solving one,” Eden said, pointing to studies done in New York City, Philadelphia and Virginia. “If it were being approached as a complement to traditional discipline I would be bullish, but given that it’s being looked at as a substitute, I’m bearish.” Daniel Losen, who is director of UCLA’s Center for Civil Rights Remedies, takes issue with Eden’s arguments on a couple of levels. First, Losen said Eden is cherry-picking indicators to make schools seem more unsafe than they actually are. Secondly, he sees in Eden a failure to acknowledge that there is strong evidence showing that suspensions and other isolating punishments are harmful to students, especially students of color. “No one wants the reform efforts to yield something worse than before,” Losen said. “But we have to reject the status quo. Schools are doing things that are harmful to kids right now, and we need to stop that — their civil rights are being violated.” A winding road to progress It is because of disagreements like the one between Eden and Losen that Sonia Llamas, Santa Ana Unified’s assistant superintendent for school performance and culture, spends a lot of her time documenting her district’s success with restorative practices and showing how they help its bottom line. Five years ago, Santa Ana Unified had nearly 9,800 days of suspensions, Llamas said, which cost the district about $680,000 because state funding is calculated based on average daily enrollment. Since then, thanks to a grant from the federal Department of Education, the district has invested more than $3 million in restorative justice and related programs and seen its suspensions drop by 75 percent. “People can talk a good talk, but you need strong data to show what’s working,” Llamas said. “It is really hard to cut something that is showing impact.” That being said, Llamas and other proponents emphasize that transforming a school’s climate and culture often happens in fits and starts and requires commitment and patience from schools and communities. “The ability to do RJ is based on where a school and its community are at and start from there,” said David Yusem, Oakland Unified’s restorative justice coordinator. “Right now, there are some schools, just like some communities, that are ready for RJ and it can come in really nicely. Then there are other schools that are fractured and it’s tough to implement it.” John Jones III recently moved to Oakland from Portland and his son, a 9th-grader at Fremont High, has had trouble adjusting to his new school. Jones, who works for a community group as a restorative justice facilitator, said the school’s handling of altercations his son had with a teacher showed the progress Fremont has made as well as how far it still has to go. “My biggest critique is that I wasn’t notified of the situation until months afterwards,” Jones said. “Once there is the first inkling of a problem, parents should be brought in…the old proverb is true, it does take a village to raise a child — and it’s important that everyone is on the same page.” While they acknowledge their progress has not gone in a straight line, the staff at Fremont High feel they are slowly getting on the same page. The school is on track to cut suspensions in half from last year, said Co-Principal Tom Skjervheim. “Part of the challenge is we have lots of students who need support in any given day,” Skjervheim said. “[But] now that we have a system where RJ can live — it is setting us up for more success.” When asked whether she learns more from being suspended or going through restorative justice when she gets in trouble for fighting, the 9th-grade girl who had sought Chaterji’s counsel after the problems in her third-period class rolled her eyes. “It’s all a waste of time,” she said. But when pressed further, she gave a clear-headed comparison of the two approaches. “I could be getting into a fight with someone and get suspended. Then I come back and it could still be a fight,” she said. “If I don’t get suspended and we talk it out, there is a higher chance of there being no more problems.” This story is the first of a three-part series on restorative justice in California which originally appeared on EdSource.org Part two: The story of a South LA high school's journey back from the brink   Part three: Resources often don't match rhetoric for restorative justice in California schools",they,left,room
"The first kickoff of the NFL season will take place tonight. The first tackle will not be far behind. During that event, the brain of both tackler and tackled will slosh against the inside of their respective skulls, setting in motion what might in many years culminate in a unique dementia syndrome that has resulted in the deaths of more than 100 NFL players to date. It was dubbed dementia pugilistica by the great pathologist Harrison Martland in 1928 but came to be known as “punch-drunk syndrome” for the next eight decades. Today it is known by a different name, Chronic Traumatic Encephalopthy (CTE), and the poster child for the disease is no longer the scrappy pugilist taking his licks in the ring, but the football player taking hits on the gridiron. CTE is a neurodegenerative disorder, meaning a condition in which brain cells die at an accelerated rate over time. Neurodegenerative disorders, like Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, each have their own classic symptoms, but they often end the same way – in the death of the afflicted. CTE acts differently than other neurodegenerative disorders in that it is characterized not only by cognitive impairment but by significant and often disturbing changes in behavior and mood. The suicides of several high-profile professional athletes, beginning with NFL player Terry Luther Long in 2005, brought CTE into the public consciousness. And with more attention, more cases came to light. Expanding quickly beyond football, cases of CTE appeared in virtually every contact sport: ice hockey, professional wrestling, rugby, even water polo. But despite a proliferation of cases, research into the mechanisms of this disease has only begun to reveal the true causes and potential effects. Despite almost a century of experience with the condition, the gaps in our knowledge are vast. Here’s what we still don’t know: Examine a piece of normal brain under a microscope, and you will see a field of pinkish uniform material punctuated by darker blue islands in a pattern that looks a bit like banana bread. The pink background is made up of the thousands of tails (axons) of neurons, coursing together to send and receive signals throughout the body. The blue islands are the cell bodies of neurons and their supporting cells known as glial cells. But examine the brain of someone with CTE, and a new pattern emerges. When revealed by a special stain, dense deposits and tangles of a protein called hyperphosphorylated tau appear inside the neurons. These tangles can appear anywhere in the brain, but seem to aggregate at the base of the brain sulci – the bottom of those wrinkles that give the human brain its distinctive character (and power). These tangles appear to disrupt the neuron and are associated with the eventual death of the cells as well. But whether the tangles are the initiating event that leads to cell death or a marker of a cell going awry for another reason is yet another mystery. These examinations take place at autopsy. The risks of taking a piece of living brain to make a diagnosis are simply too high. Without a test for CTE that can be used in living individuals, research has been severely hamstrung. Several scientists are working on this very issue. The most promising approach seems to be to use a special type of brain scan called positron emission tomography (PET). PET scans inject a radioactive tracer into an individual which is designed to bind to a specific substance in the body. One investigatory tracer binds to tau protein, allowing us to see the deposition of these tangles without removing a piece of brain from the body. But to confirm that these tests are valid, we’ll need to scan patients while they are alive and follow-up with the gold-standard autopsy-based test after death. This will take some time. Tau protein, in its normal form, is critical for neurons to function. It helps stabilize microtubules, the “railroad tracks” of axons which transport proteins to and from the cell body to the distant axonal tail. Tau is a highly soluble protein – it dissolves easily in water – when it is properly folded. But mi-fold the protein, and it starts to stick to itself. Multiple copies of tau amalgamate creating those characteristic tangles. These proteinaceous globules do not function as they are supposed to and in fact disrupt the functioning of the neurons themselves, perhaps leading to their death. But what initiates this misfolding event? Tau protein deposition is a prominent feature in several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s diseases. In CTE, greater tau deposition is linked to greater number of concussions and more years of football playing, suggesting that repeated trauma is a precipitating event, but without understanding the real link between trauma and tau, it is unlikely that an effective treatment will be developed. A highly publicized study appearing in the Journal of the American Medical Association documented that 99 percent of donated brains from NFL players had pathology consistent with CTE. Less reported data from that study showed that 21 percent of the brains donated by high-school football players and 91 percent of those donated by college football players had evidence of the disease. At face value, these numbers are truly damning. It would be ethically untenable to allow football to continue if one out of every five high school kids who plays has clear evidence of brain damage. But a phenomenon known as selection bias is at play here. These brains were donated precisely because the individuals showed concerning symptoms before they died. They were selected from the true population of football players in a non-random way. Imagine if we tried to calculate how many cars had dirty oil filters by examining them at a Jiffy Lube – we’d vastly overestimate the true rate. But because diagnosis can only be made after death we are extremely limited in our sampling. The true prevalence of CTE in American Professional Football Players could be 0.4 percent on the low end, still concerning, but perhaps tolerable. But most researchers suspect the number to be much higher. Despite the publicity, reported cases of CTE are few and far between. Almost all the case series come from two labs run by expert pathologists. This has led some to suggest that perhaps CTE is not a true disease entity at all. Perhaps the football players were simply suffering from Alzheimer’s disease or another dementia, and these pathologists are reading too much into their history of playing sports. Anne McKee, a pathologist at Boston University, has collected the largest series of patients with CTE in the world. She is the lead author of that famous “99 percent” paper. I asked her if her team had independent pathologists review her diagnoses. They had not, but she notes that a new consortium promises to do just that – have multiple, independent pathologists make diagnoses based on the same slides in order to determine the rate of agreement. A high rate of agreement will be compelling evidence that CTE is its own disease, distinct from the multitude of other neurodegenerative disorders. Football apologists are quick to point out that most of the individuals diagnosed with CTE played football in an “earlier era” where safety was not as big a concern. In modern football, players tackle differently, use different equipment, and are protected by new rules such as those that require a play to be ended if a player’s helmet comes off. But there is little evidence to suggest that any of these changes will make a difference. A 2014 study appearing in the American Journal of Sports Medicine found similar concussion rates among high school football players regardless of the helmet brand used. Tackling technique may not matter much when, as this NFL study shows, even well-anticipated tackles (such as those that occur during a kick return) can result in concussion. We are deep into the realm of motivated reasoning here. Many of us want football to be safe, because we love the sport. While professional players clearly understand that there are risks associated with playing, there is an ocean of difference between knee injuries, broken fingers and a chronic, debilitating and degenerative brain disease. And while professional players are at least compensated financially, the same cannot be said for college and high school players. Calls to ban youth football are rare but increasing. And they will increase more, I suspect, as the science around chronic head injury develops. It is a defining feature of the enterprise of science to admit what we don’t know. It is also the tendency of scientists to maintain the status quo in the face of uncertainty. Under those conditions, awaiting more data before we engage in efforts to prohibit youth football seems appropriate and reasonable. But personally, I have my doubts. The answers to these questions are coming. When they are answered, will we look back at the decisions we make now with regret?",helmet,tackle,play
"Three days ago, Timothée Chalamet, who stars in the critically-acclaimed film “Call Me by Your Name,” posted on his official Instagram account that he was giving his salary from starring in the yet-to-be-released Woody Allen film, “A Rainy Day in New York,” to three nonprofit organizations. Other actors who have starred in Allen’s films have said recently that they are doing the same, but what was unusual about Chalamet’s statement was that unlike his colleagues, he did not criticize Allen or offer words of support to Allen’s estranged daughter Dylan Farrow, who has accused her father of sexual abuse (Allen has denied the allegations).  In the post, Chalamet said he was not able to comment on his decision to star in the film, or on Allen, because of “contractual obligations.”   A post shared by Timothée Chalamet (@tchalamet) on Jan 15, 2018 at 8:51pm PST HuffPost obtained a copy of Chalamet’s contract from a source with access to it, and a review of the document reveals that Chalamet is under no contractual obligation to remain silent about his thoughts with respect to Allen, nor does it prevent him from offering support to Dylan Farrow, which raises the question of why he chose to make such a statement and why he is hesitant to comment on Allen. Chalmet’s donation and Instagram post comes right before voting closes for the Screen Actors Guild Awards and ahead of nominations for the Academy Awards that will be announced on Tuesday. The SAG Awards are airing live Sunday, and voting for them closes Friday at 12 p.m. PST. Given that Chalamet posted his donation announcement on Tuesday, that gave him enough time to gain the attention of his fellow actors before they vote for the awards. Two prominent actors who have won SAG awards in the past but aren’t in contention for this year’s awards, who spoke to HuffPost on the condition of anonymity, have accused Chalamet of attempting to play both sides of the game. They say it is an effort to appease SAG voters and members of the Academy who will be voting for Best Actor should Chalamet receive a nomination. By donating the money he is appeasing members who believe that Allen abused Farrow, but by not criticizing him explicitly he is avoiding the ire of members who don’t believe the accusations against Allen, including actor Alec Baldwin, who recently referred to actors who have denounced Allen as “unfair and sad.” In an email to HuffPost, Chalamet’s representatives claimed that a clause in the standard SAG agreement (which is shown below) that was attached to Chalamet’s contract prevents him from speaking publicly. But that clause, according to two attorneys who reviewed it at HuffPost’s request, does nothing to prevent Chalamet from speaking publicly about accusations against Allen and from Chalamet offering a word of support to Farrow. Further contradicting the assessment of Chalamet’s representatives is the fact that one of Chalamet’s co-stars in Allen’s latest film did speak out in support of Dylan Farrow. In an Instagram post, actress Rebecca Hall said, in part: “After reading and re-reading Dylan Farrow’s statements of a few days ago and going back and reading the older ones ― I see, not only how complicated this matter is, but that my actions have made another woman feel silenced and dismissed. That is not something that sits easily with me in the current or indeed any moment, and I am profoundly sorry. I regret this decision and wouldn’t make the same one today.”",I,is,current
"President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that the U.S. will withdraw from the international nuclear accord with Iran, the landmark 2015 agreement curbing Iran’s nuclear development program in return for sanctions relief.  By ending America’s participation in the deal, Trump fulfills a major campaign promise. But the decision could set the stage for an international political crisis and uncertainty over the future of Iran’s nuclear program. Here’s what you need to know about the agreement:  Also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the deal is the result of a decade of international negotiations to curb Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. Although Iran is banned from possessing nuclear weapons as a state party of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it failed to disclose the existence of its uranium-enrichment program for 18 years, causing alarm when its clandestine program was revealed in 2003. Negotiators from Iran and six other world powers, including the United Nations Security Council’s five permanent members and Germany, reached the historic agreement on July 14, 2015. It placed strict limits on Tehran’s nuclear program that were set to last for more than a decade.  The United Nations Security Council endorsed the deal on July 20, 2015, officially agreeing to “terminate” U.N. sanctions on Iran. The JCPOA was a “once in a lifetime opportunity,” then-President Barack Obama said at the time it was agreed. “This is our best bet by far to make sure Iran doesn’t get a nuclear weapon,” Obama added. Tehran had always maintained that its nuclear development was only intended for energy and other peaceful purposes, but fears the Islamic Republic was working on developing a nuclear bomb had been rising in the West. Critics of the agreement, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, argued that the deal at its core was not tough enough on Iran. “Not a single nuclear facility is shut down, including the underground facilities that [Iran builds] illicitly,” Netanyahu said in 2015. “Thousands of centrifuges will keep spinning, enriching uranium. That’s a very bad deal.” Trump has echoed these concerns, repeatedly calling it “the worst deal ever.” At its most basic level, the deal meant Iran agreed to put heavy restrictions on its nuclear program in exchange for world powers lifting economic sanctions that target the country. The deal lasts until 2030, with some restrictions expiring before then and other inspection measures extending years beyond that date.  Prior to the agreement, international sanctions and trade embargoes had cost the Iranian economy tens of billions of dollars.  Iran stood to benefit from a potential increase in foreign investment and access to the Swift international banking system. In return, the rest of the parties to the agreement believed they had security that Iran was always at least a year away from being able to build a nuclear weapon during the time that the deal was enforced. Under the terms of the deal, Iran agreed to remove or reduce many of the components needed to create nuclear weapons. The country accepted a 98 percent reduction of its uranium stockpile, the removal of a reactor core used to make plutonium at the Arak heavy water plant and the reduction of thousands of centrifuges needed to enrich uranium. Iran also agreed to limit its research and development work, as well as several other restrictions. The deal contained strict rules on monitoring and inspection of Iran’s nuclear sites. The International Atomic Energy Agency was required to extensively monitor Iran’s nuclear facilities, and IAEA workers had access to a live video stream of areas including Iranian uranium enrichment plants. Inspectors also have wide-ranging access to sites within the country that they deem necessary to investigate. While conducting this monitoring and inspection regime, the IAEA confirmed nine times that Iran was in compliance with the JCPOA. The Consequences Of Scrapping The Deal In the immediate aftermath of Trump’s announcement, European and Iranian officials condemned the U.S. decision and vowed to pursue separate negotiations to continue the nuclear deal. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on signatories to the deal to maintain their commitments despite the U.S. violation. But if the Iran nuclear deal eventually falls apart as a result of Trump’s decision to pull out of the agreement, there are several potential outcomes. The U.S. and other world powers could attempt to negotiate a new deal with Iran on terms that Trump finds more favorable. French President Emmanuel Macron has floated the prospect of a new deal that would entail renegotiating certain aspects of the current agreement. But Iran has rejected the prospect of a new deal, and experts say that Iran will have little incentive to enter into a future agreement if the JCPOA is ignored. Europe could also try to find a way to preserve elements of the deal and work around U.S. sanctions, something which Iran has signaled it is open to, but analysts say that is diplomatically risky and technically difficult. In this scenario, the European Union would take legal measures to shield European companies that do business with Iran from incurring U.S. sanctions. If there is no way to work around the deal, renewed economic sanctions on Iran would dry up foreign investment from the country.  Iran could choose to once again begin developing its nuclear capabilities. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is already under pressure from hardliners who have tried to undermine the deal, and he said following Trump’s speech that Iran could begin enriching uranium again if talks fail.  If Iran restarts its nuclear program, it would put the country back on the path to conflict with the U.S., Israel and possibly other Western powers.

"For five decades, long-distance swimmer Diana Nyad has been publicly discussing how her swim coach repeatedly assaulted her when she was 14. She knows her situation is not unique, and she hopes that continuing to tell her story will convince other women to do the same. In a New York Times op-ed published on Thursday, Nyad wrote that in 1964, she was napping at her coach’s house between state championship races when “out of nowhere, he was on top of me.” “He yanked my suit down. He grabbed at and drooled onto my breasts. He hyperventilated and moaned. I didn’t breathe for perhaps two full minutes, my body locked in an impenetrable flex. My arms trembled, pinned to my sides. He pleaded with me to open my legs, but they were pressed hard together. “He ejaculated on my stomach, my athletic torso I was so proud of now suddenly violated with this strange and foul stuff.” The incident marked the “beginning of years of covert molestation,” Nyad wrote. She said the coach assaulted her again before her team traveled to the national championships. “I sat through classes, distracted by an image of hacking my breasts off with a razor blade,” she said. “Overnight, I began going through life a solitary soldier.” Nyad said she first found the courage to speak up at age 21, confiding in a friend who told her she’d been molested by the same coach. Her coach was fired, but continued to be celebrated in the coaching community until his death in 2014. She does not identify her former coach by name. Speaking up fosters connections between women who have undergone similar trauma, Nyad said, sharing that after one speaking engagement, an elderly woman ended up telling her how her father had started molesting her at age three. In the wake of the sexual assault and harassment allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and a number of other powerful men, Nyad says she’s been heartened by the flood of women who have come forward, many finding solidarity through the #MeToo hashtag. But she knows there are many more who have yet to tell their stories. “I will continue to tell my story until all girls and women find their own voice,” Nyad wrote. “We need to construct an accurate archive of these abuses. And we need to prepare coming generations to speak up in the moment, rather than be coerced into years of mute helplessness.” Sexual abuse appears to be rampant in the professional sports world, among many other places. Two-time Olympic medalist McKayla Maroney revealed last month that USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar ― who had already been accused of abusing more than 100 women ― had been abusing her since she was 13. Meanwhile, more than 100 USA Swimming coaches have been banned for life for sexual abuse. Read Nyad’s story in The New York Times here.",arms,trembled,sides
"This is the fifth installment in the series, The 3D-Materialization of Art,  an ongoing survey tracing the new and growing movement of highly-reflexive 3D spectacle and narrative art and activism. Made by artists who distance themselves from the commercial uses of 3D in motion pictures, television, advertising and gaming, the new 3D artists employ the same technology that the commercial industries use. The difference is the 3D-materialization artists extend the dematerializing values and strategies of Conceptual Art to digital imaging, narratives, mythopoetics, satires and paradigms that promote progressive and sustainable political, cultural and natural lifestyles for the present and future. The other Huffington Post features in the series include commentaries and criticisms on the 3D art of Claudia Hart, Kurt Hentschlaeger, Matthew Weinstein, and the bitforms gallery exhibition, Post Pictures: A New Generation of Pictorial Structuralists A related article includes the digital art of Morehshin Allahyari in a particularly global feminist context. Jonathan Monaghan, excerpts from the HD films The Pavilion, 2014,
and Escape Pod, 2015, from the 2015 bitforms gallery installation, Escape Pod. There is a distinctly authoritarian directive ominously, if sardonically, commandeering us through Jonathan Monaghan's 3D film loop, The Pavilion. Of course the best artists always compel us to see worlds we aren't ready or don't want to see. But the imagery that Monaghan mashes together from the pixels of real photographed consumer products and high-end real estate is composed to purposely impose upon our minds the signage of imperious expectations and rarified tastes that we instantly read to be issued from ""above"". That we so easily recognize Monaghan's The Pavilion to be the abode of the oligarchical class despite their physical absence indicates the degree to which we have had to contend with oligarchy in our lives and have even grown accustomed to its ubiquitous presence.  We of course read the luxurious interiors and perverse technological innovations and artifacts  to be the playthings of the rich and powerful. It helps that Monaghan's 3D mise-en-scenes are so real in appearance as to represent the most tangible of elite tastes, firstly, in a haute-couture showroom of militaristic riot gear for the oligarch with stringent security and defense needs at home and at work, and secondly in a luxurious bed chamber and its encompassing closet designed for ... him? her? The oligarch's gender is not only withheld, it is irrelevant to our cultural present. All that matters is that the oligarchical class is represented through the signage of their possessions and lifestyles as a permanent if ominous American fixation of usurped power and the obscene imbalance of wealth acquired through the flattening of democracy.
Jonathan Monaghan, The Pavilion, 2014, animated HD film, 3 minutes, seamless loop, courtesy of bitforms gallery. Monaghan's cutting-edge visual and conceptual designs convey that he is as capacious in his vision, as meticulous in his craftsmanship, and as mythopoetically literate as either Mariko Mori or Matthew Barney. Monaghan leaves his mark on 3D with the evocative stillness he imposes on a medium commercially designed for generating the fast and furious mainstream animations of blockbuster cinema productions that reduce audience attention spans. Presenting a stark contrast to the knock offs of popular culture, Monaghan distinguishes himself from the 3D artists informed by popular animation, as well as from those who use 3D to extend the media of painting and sculpture . In The Pavilion, Monahan's slow conveyance of the viewer's gaze through expansive 3D spaces filled with streamlined objects and real brands reveals his visual literacy has been conditioned by advertising and cinema, two fields that share a decidedly intentional (as opposed to incidental or aesthetic) aim to their designs. In this regard the intention in The Pavilion manifests as a heightening of the ambience of largesse and cultural virility.
 Jonathan Monaghan. Two close up views of the paramilitary riot gear boutique in The Pavilion, 2014, animated HD film, 3 minutes, seamless loop, courtesy of bitforms gallery. With objects mimicking all the artifice of advertising -- the magic of immanent wish fulfillment; the fetishistic stimulation of eroticism; the invocation of power and status -- Monaghan's visualizations simulate the virtuoso technics of cinema: the motion capture of camera zooms, pans and ellipses; the compositional panoramas of the full depth of field; the montage of scenic juxtapositions. Monaghan further adds to the illusion of The Pavilion's realism by making his survey of rooms appear direct, candid and emphatic, even as he employs the ruses of advertising and the seductive tropes of cinema to construct a semiotic and existential comic-tableau satirizing the media's direct intersection with the imperatives of the oligarchical class.
Jonathan Monaghan. The bed chamber in The Pavilion, 2014, animated HD film, 3 minutes, seamless loop, courtesy of bitforms gallery. When we are conveyed first into and through the antiseptic showroom of The Pavilion, we take in the semiotics of a defensive power so real in its display of paramilitary riot gear, some of us may be baffled about whether to laugh or to shudder at the signage of the American militaristic imperative on display with all the design imperative and gentrified discretion of an Armani emporium or a Prada boutique. Exiting the showroom, Monaghan escorts us to an elaborately minimalist bed chamber outfitted with a status-affirming consumerism so pronounced it could easily be mistaken for a temple to compulsive consumption, a modern pharaoh's tomb outfitted with an array of closets concealing all the artifacts required of the afterlife. Naturally an iconography of class, especially that concerning a class which enshrouds itself in remoteness and privacy, is always predisposed to cliche and stereotype -- the invasion of the ideal at every step of interpretation. But Monaghan's sense of humor brings both cliche and stereotype as much into focus as subjects of his satirical pictorialism as he does the rich we largely imagine. In short, The Pavilion is more about our envy and fantasies of the rich and powerful than it is about them, and in this Monaghan draws a caricature that is no more a portrait than are conventional Hollywood movies.
Jonathan Monaghan. The sphincter skylight in The Pavilion, 2014, animated HD film, 3 minutes, seamless loop, courtesy of bitforms gallery. If his mashups of the showroom and bed chamber convey Monaghan's understanding of the sociology of design in marketing, it is Monaghan's cinematographically-styled, yet entirely-simulated long shots, slow zooms and pans that steer our visual conveyance into and through the showroom, then out its doors to the open expanse of horizontality defining the immaculate bedchamber. Monaghan's videos comprised of simulated slow camera pans and zooms of imagined landscapes, interiors and objects are informed more by such signature sci-fi films as Stanley Kubrick's  2001: A Space Odyssey, Andre Tarkovsky's Solaris and Ridley Scott's Alien and Prometheus, only transferred to earthly and decidedly corporate and global terrain. It's more than just the software simulating a real camera filming an elaborately futuristic soundstage set that commands our attention. It's the simulation of a camera simulating the human gaze that Monaghan evokes with the mastery of a cinematographer. And it's the mood that the music and audio discretely imparts.
Jonathan Monaghan. The biomechatronic (or cyborg) leather-upholstered egg with testicles emerges through the sphincter skylight in The Pavilion, 2014, animated HD film, 3 minutes, seamless loop, courtesy of bitforms gallery. It is exactly this formal yet imaginary play on a camera's capture of still and luxurious spaces that recalls the faux Louis XVI bedchamber at the end of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Even more importantly, Monaghan recreates for audiences in 2015 the kind of disorienting experience that Kubrick introduced to unprepared audiences in 1969. The difference, of course, is that Kubrick photographed his speed-of-light parable on a soundstage furnished with props, whereas Monaghan, sans camera and film crew, has done no more than computationally cropped disparate photographic details of high-end furnishings and decorative objects that he then recomposes into ultra-glossy animation stills. It is such stills that Monaghan slowly enlarges onscreen to effect the illusion of a physical camera's approach through space. In short, Monaghan is making that film which the Motion Picture Industry has predicted since the invention of motion capture technology will be made without live actors and  physical sets. As far as 3D goes, Monaghan's simulation is simple, yet it is the simplicity of the illusion that makes the effect all the more challenging to our preconceptions of reality and ideality. If we have learned anything from the history of art, it is that it takes very little formal alteration to a picture or an object to transform it from a model of reality into a representation of ideality, and vice versa. It is this simplest of visual magics which make all the debates over what is real and what is ideal -- as argued by philosophers since the Greek PreSocratics and the Indus Vedic scribes, and over the centuries reconfigured the debates of epistemologists and phenomenologists, existentialists and ontologists, structuralists and culturalists -- all over what is the distinction between and the linkage mediating the real and the ideal, when they in fact may very well be the same.

Jonathan Monaghan. The ITO-Interrogator Egg, a biomechatronic (or cyborg) leather-upholstered egg with anterior testicles, descends in The Pavilion, 2014, animated HD film, 3 minutes, seamless loop, courtesy of bitforms gallery. The real vs. ideal debate is neutralized more by 3D than any other medium, including photography, though it is with his mashups of photographs that Monaghan's renderings reconcile the debate of the real vs. the ideal at least artistically. But so far I have only accounted for Monaghan's simulation of the real, which is in fact it's opposite, the ideal. To account for the real real, we must also look to its opposite in the ideal, or what in The Pavilion appears as the surreal. For it is in the working out of the creative process of the mind as a surreality (or ideality) that we in fact manifest the reality that is always a construct of consciousness. The transformation from the appearance of the real to the realization of the ideal is so slow that it takes a moment for the viewer to register that at the center of the bed chamber ceiling is the musculature of a tightly-closed sphincter. The real has suddenly become the surreal as the sphincter opens to reveal the sky. Then, as the orifice widens, through it descends a biomechatronic egg designed after that supremely imperial object'dart, the Fabergé Egg, only now upholstered in black-leather and outfitted with a pair of human testicles on its anterior (because the oligarch no doubt believes it takes balls to be a raider and pillager of the little people's savings and property.) It is one of Monaghan's series of eggs referencing the architecture, corporations, genetic and biomechatronic experiments of the past and present, all crafted with the interests of today's global oligarchy in mind.

Monaghan's Eggs have all the right consumer touches to make the work both compelling as uncanny design and social satire, though he may have gotten a bit too derivative of Matthew Barney in his recourse to the biomechatronic motif better known as the cyborg. But as one of the truly contemporary creations of the last century, the cyborg is likely to long be a mine of the uncanny, with the choice of what human anatomy is grafted onto what object and technology yields the desired results. Making his cyborgs not living beings but human-fabricated techno-consumer objects with miniature architectural structures, even a Starbucks store, is Monaghan's genius stroke. The cyborg that appears at the center of the bed chamber's ceiling as a sphincter opening as a skylight is the surreal ideality that propels us through to the end of the video, the whole point seemingly postulating that all reality must finally submit to an ideality of mind, whether human or godly. Even if it is no more than the product of a god's anal emission, it is a fitting end to the paleolithic origin of the artist as emulation of the god creating a world the the world's creation myths convey.

What causes these virtual objects to hold a strange and ominous power over the gaping viewer is their glimmering realism, the kind we see reproduced in high-gloss magazines. Monaghan's still photo-collages are our era's version of the 17th-century Dutch and Flemish vanitas and pronk still-lifes, replete with their moralizing ironies reflecting the transience and superficiality of such worldly and sumptuous veneers as vain and intemperate illusions. We can see in them, as consumerist microcosms, the hyperbolic expectations that begin by sheltering us from the ravages of time and space but which ultimately must yield to them.  But rather than getting stringent about consumerism, Monaghan is a true late capitalist in poking fun at the moralism of anti-capitalist ideology.

With the Freudian fetish arguably devalued in a Western society that no longer has its erotic desires restrained by severe moral codes, the current generation of artists conflate the body with the inanimate object not as some clandestine repository of sexual desire (say in finding arousal in the folds of a hat that double for the vulva), but as a formalist-inspired empathy with objects for their aesthetic appearance, functionalist extension of the body, and social denotations of status and wealth. This denotation can be either or both consumerist and aesthetic.  Of course the cyborg was born with science fiction -- chiefly such visually futuristic media as comic books and cinema that the new conflation became identified as the cyborg. By the 1980s the cyborg became a paradigm of radical transformation of identity politics with the feminist film theory of Donna Haraway's elaboration of the cyborg as a motif of empowerment for women, a signage and narrative structure that confers a superhuman ability available to women for transcending the imposed cultural and social limitations absent in the realistic mainstream media representations.

But the cyborg principle at work in Monghan's videos and photo animations emphatically reinforce the theory that art making is ultimately an expression of our unconscious desire to rejoin with the material world, the forces that have created it, or, more pragmatically, to join the real with the ideal. For the material to most of us is what is shared and thereby composes and defines the real. Conversely, the ideal is what we only resentfully admit to being private however much we will it to be the way of the world. It is a duality that perhaps motivates the artist more deeply than aesthetics or ideology. It is because the ideal cannot be made real in any collective sense that it is channeled into art, that nexus which culture vents publicly as if to placate the urge to make the ideal real in some larger revolutionary sense.

Returning to The Pavilion's affinity with Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, we can consider Monaghan's descending cyborg egg in the oligarch's bed chamber to be the uncanny equivalent of the appearance of the space pod in Kubrick's bed chamber at the end of time (what Einstein held to be arrival at the speed of light). Except that, in its day the bed chamber scene shattered the filmgoer's faith in the illusion of realism and the linear narration of cinema. Of course art audiences today are better equipped to receive the comic surreality of Monaghan's descending giant cyborg egg as the reality of simulation announcing itself. But we still consciously receive the simulation of the descending cyborg egg as if it were an elaborate prop descending in real space before a movie camera situated on a soundstage, when we are really only seeing an algorithmic calibration for scanning and enlarging a photo-computated collage as an animated illusion. Of course how much and if the audience is fooled by such a simulated subterfuge depends on its literacy in 3D platforms and tools. The 3D-informed audience however receives the reality of the simulation.  The point is that it is only after Monaghan steps up the surrealistic stylization of his video that he abandons the physics and visualizations of realism and introduces the idealities and surrealities that are the real reality at hand.
 Jonathan Monaghan. Detail of French Second Empire, 2014, inkjet print Hahnemühle photo luster on disband, courtesy of bitforms gallery. All in all, The Pavilion is Monaghan's discreet declaration that at the center of all reality is our projective ideality, and that it is this ideality that 3D excels at rendering as a reality unlike any medium before it. In his convincing 3D-materializations, Monaghan's art counts among our generation's most photorealistic illusional models of 3D art in that it passes for both a photographic and cinematographic record of real objects, spaces and gradations of light. While the revelation of the ideality simulated as reality is entertaining in the first few viewings, a more complex dialectic comes into play once the fuller phenomenological implications -- that is once an awareness of the structural features of consciousness at play throughout The Pavilion -- make themselves known. And with this phenomenological scrutiny come various proposals of a linkage, or a continuum, or a competition, between the reality of the world with the ideality of the mind busily at work mediating that reality.  In the second video loop of the exhibition, the twenty-minute Escape Pod, 2015, Monaghan returns to his former animated reveries -- what can be called the mythopoetic ideality -- that is the making of new myths for our times out of the motifs and narrations of old, even ancient mythologies. Unlike The Pavilion, Escape Pod is informed almost entirely by the legacy of traditional animation and surrealist painting even as it brings a certain luster and contemplation that is foreign to most animation. It is also informed by ancient mythologies of the hunt, specifically those of Norse and Greek variety centering on the plight of the Stag and its symbolic references to the life stages of birth, maturity and death. To add to the complexity, Monaghan transposes the Stag to modernist spaces largely rendered with conventional animation software, though here too there is a photographic departure especially noticeable in the forest and water settings.

 Yet for all its mythopoetic ingenuity, Escape Pod is altogether more traditional in its narrational structure and visualization and less reflexive in its imagery's relationship of the structures of our experience of the world, consciousness of mind, and the modeling of reality and ideality simultaneously in terms of pictorial narration. A mountain landscapes evocative of Salvador Dali conveys that the imagery of dream is being conflated without the iconography of traditional myth in the engaging and beautiful figure of the golden Stag. While the mountain motifs and other landscape imagery recall the sensory-motor coordination of traditional painting, the animals that embody Innocence in Escape Pod come into being with the animation modeling designed for cartoons, however much they are rendered here with heightened technical finesse, greater dimensionality and a more dreamlike arbitrariness and futility of purpose. But what distances Monaghan's cartoons most from the renderings of commercial productions is their sense of bewilderment and loss of meaningful direction in their imperative of escaping -- What? -- an unseen yet ominous fate that traditionally was the hunter, sometimes a god, but here seems to be an existential if unseen entity representing ubiquitous, dangerous and deadly pursuit, capture and containment.
Jonathan Monaghan. Escape Pod, 2015, animated HD film, 20 minutes, seamless loop, courtesy of bitforms gallery.animated HD film, 3 minutes, seamless loop, courtesy of bitforms gallery. Escape Pod is at its best a conflation of archetypes and analogies concerning innocence and its loss amid a commercial and autocratic superstructure. But its mytholopoetic treatment makes the appearance of the animal cyborgs less incongruent, since there is no rendering of reality to be incongruent to. Instead of a theoretical contemplation to ponder, we relax in an sardonic entertainment, sometimes filled with the pathos of the innocent, yet breaking into a comic surreality with the descent of a hovering giant architectural spacecraft, again equipped with anterior testicles, and foretelling the oligarchical race of the future.  To his credit, Monaghan is an impeccable formalist and compelling steward of the audience through a uniquely tangible succession of spaces, each real and captivating enough to impel debate as to how much the artist's control over what we see is autocratic to the point of reducing the viewer to a passive observer, as opposed to an active participant. But this is his point. Whether or not he has in mind Guy de Bord's theory of the consumer society spellbound into political inaction and subservience by the spectacles of capitalism (see my Matthew Weinstein feature), Monaghan is circumnavigating us through an array of the late capitalist, corporately-branded spectacles keeping us riveted to them at the same time that we discern their allure is a mirage of mythological thinking distracting us from real action.
Recollections of Salvador Dali. Left: The Transparent Simulacrum of the Feigned Image, 1938, oil on canvas. Right: Disintegration of The Persistence of Memory, 1952-54, oil on canvas. Earlier videos by Monaghan which pay a more direct homage to the cartoon legacy of animation make our political distraction by entertainment abundantly clear. But the superrealism of the new work confuses such cautionary prompts in being so very seductive in their technical proficiency.  I personally prefer this ambiguity, as it is the one lapse in the Monaghan vision that allows us some resistance to the artist's commanding moral and political steerage of our experience of his art. For even when we agree with an artist's point of view, the impulse for individuality compels us to search out some flaw or lapse that facilitates our departure.

Perhaps the greatest human flaw is our proclivity to be seduced by the delusion of reality. It imagines that we can know the world without any interference from our own personal and social experience. As if we can see without the structure of our own eyes and brains mediating, interfering. Reality is the delusion that we can see the world as it is, rather than the world as we make it appear. It is why I don't use the term virtual reality to refer to or describe 3D animations. For all reality is virtual, while 3D as a category makes obvious what the human mind dimensionally shares with the reality that is so elusive to the mind.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apple Inc said the U.S. Justice Department's new attempts to unlock an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters without the tech giant's help could eliminate the government's need for its assistance in a similar dispute in New York. The company's position was laid out in a letter filed on Thursday in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, seeking to delay briefing in the Justice Department's appeal of a ruling that protects Apple from unlocking an iPhone in a drug case. The letter came after U.S. prosecutors on Monday disclosed that ""an outside party"" had presented a possible way to open the phone in the San Bernardino investigation, which they said could eliminate the need for an order requiring Apple's help. In its letter, Apple said if the method being evaluated in the San Bernardino case can also be used in the Brooklyn drug case, ""it would eliminate the need for Apple's assistance."" Apple said that could affect the Justice Department's appeal of a Feb. 29 ruling by U.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein that he did not have authority to order Apple to disable the security of an iPhone seized during the drug investigation. ""On the other hand, if the DOJ claims that the method will not work on the iPhone here, Apple will seek to test that claim, as well as any claims by the government that other methods cannot be used,"" Apple said in the letter. Apple as a result asked U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie, who is presiding over the appeal, to delay the briefing schedule in the case by at least 10 days after the Justice Department files a status report on April 5 in the San Bernardino case. A spokeswoman for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. Apple in its letter said the Justice Department did not oppose the delay. The phone in the Brooklyn case belonged to Jun Feng, who has since pleaded guilty to participation in a methamphetamine distribution conspiracy. The Justice Department sought to unlock Feng's phone to find other conspirators. Unlike the phone used by Rizwan Farook in San Bernardino, Feng's phone had an older operating system, iOS 7, which is not protected under the same encryption technology.

"For a long time, I didn’t know that my grandfather came from North Korea. He wasn’t trying to keep it secret. It just wasn’t a big deal.  Now it is. As an international student in the U.S., I’ve fielded many questions about whether I’m from North or South Korea. “What’s the North like?” classmates ask. “Do North Korean people come to the U.S.?” To me, the answer seems obvious. How could anyone leave or visit North Korea? Leader Kim Jong-un doesn’t allow people in or out. And more recently, President Donald Trump added North Korea to his travel ban.  At age 6, I remember asking my father whether he had visited the north. “It’s not a place you can go,” he said. Armed soldiers heavily guard the border on both sides, separated by a barbed wire fence with spikes on top. I’ve yet to meet a South Korean who voluntarily wanted to go near it. I’ve never ventured farther north than Seoul. But my grandfather, who smiled and rubbed his nose against mine every time he saw me, was born there. “Whose granddaughter are you?” he said. “Whose little girl?!” In 1950, just as the Korean War began, he and 10 of his 12 siblings crossed the border to Seoul. Before both sides agreed to a cease-fire in 1953, Koreans could still move freely. Like many people, my grandfather and his family pulled wooden carriages, carrying their children and belongings. They felt restricted by a controlling communist government, known to kill citizens who believed in democracy.  So they relocated. The second and fourth oldest children chose to stay behind. One was the highest-ranking official at a train station and didn’t feel the need to uproot. The other wanted to continue her career on the regional ski team. To this day, we don’t know what happened to them. (Since the armistice in 1953, letters and phone calls have been forbidden.) When his family crossed the border, my grandfather, the third child, was 18. As he started his new life, he decided to make money instead of going to school. He apprenticed with a local photographer and learned to use a camera. Eventually, he started a wedding hall, with an in-house photo studio. But he wanted more.  He had heard about a man who, despite being illiterate, was the richest man in the region. My grandfather visited him. “How can I become like you?” he asked.  His answer: “Whenever I had any money, I bought land. Keep doing that, and it’ll grow before you know it.” So my grandfather started a real estate business and raised four children, emphasizing education because that’s what he missed growing up.  He sent all his kids to private school in Seoul and his nine grandchildren, including me, to top U.S. boarding schools and private universities. The youngest in the family, I was undisputedly his favorite grandchild, earning the nickname “little puppy.” My grandfather pushed my parents to bring me to the U.S. at age 7 and to enroll me in the best schools.  My father listened to the man he worshipped and sent me to Fairmont Private School, Rumsey Hall School, Phillips Exeter Academy and now, Northwestern University.  But my grandfather developed Alzheimer’s disease and forgot who I was. He died on his 81st birthday in July 2014.  I never felt that my grandfather was any “different” because of where he was born. He didn’t think he was, either.  Yet like the rest of the world, I’m curious to know more about his mysterious homeland.  Fortunately, South Korean TV producers have created at least four television shows hosting defectors. Each week the Moranbong Club brings in a panel of seven different runaways, who dish about their life in North Korea – from their intense, violent military training at age 17 to their escapes across the Tumen River into China and then back to South Korea.  North Korea’s 25 million citizens and South Korea’s 51 million speak the same language but in different dialects. They share similar foods (like naengmyeon, or cold noodles) but prepare them in different styles. They started as one kingdom. But since the end of World War II in 1945, after the U.S. backed the south and Russia installed a communist regime in the north, they’ve officially been enemies. Yet the defectors say North Koreans are taught that the U.S. is the true foe. Perhaps that’s because many South Koreans, like me, have relatives in the north, even if they’ve never met them. So even more than the rest of the world, I hope for safety and peace for both sides. ",I,answer,land
"In September 2016, Rachael Denhollander was the first woman to go public with accusations of sexual abuse against former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University team doctor Larry Nassar. Since then, she has endured character assassinations from Nassar’s defense attorneys, a constant onslaught of victim-blaming, and the inevitable isolation of being the only woman to publicly accuse him for six months.  On Wednesday, she was the last of 169 survivors and family members to give her victim impact statement in court after a week-long sentencing hearing for Nassar. Her words were comprehensive, powerful and full of resilience.  “You started the tidal wave. You made all of this happen. You made all of these voices matter. Your sister survivors and I thank you,” Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said in response to Denhollander’s impact statement.  Nassar, who is accused of sexually abusing over 140 women, was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison on Wednesday afternoon on seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. He is already serving 60 years in prison on child pornography charges and awaits sentencing on three more counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. Denhollander’s statement is so all-encompassing, HuffPost decided her story should be read in her own words.  Below is her powerful statement in full, lightly edited for clarity. **** I do want to thank you, first, Judge Aquilina, for giving all of us the chance to reclaim our voices. Our voices were taken from us for so long, and I’m grateful beyond what I can express that you have given us the chance to restore them. There are two major purposes in our criminal justice system, Your Honor: the pursuit of justice and the protection of the innocent. Neither of these purposes can be met if anything less than the maximum available sentence under the plea agreement is imposed upon Larry for his crimes. Not because the federal sentence he will already serve is lacking, but because the sentence rendered today will send a message across this country, a message to every victim and a message to every perpetrator. I realize you have many factors to consider when you fashion your sentence, but I submit to you that the pre-eminent question in this case as you reach a decision about how best to satisfy the dual aims of this court is the same question that I asked Judge Neff to consider: How much is a little girl worth? How much is a young woman worth? Larry is a hardened and determined sexual predator. I know this first-hand. At age 15, when I suffered from chronic back pain, Larry sexually assaulted me repeatedly under the guise of medical treatment for nearly a year. He did this with my own mother in the room, carefully and perfectly obstructing her view so she would not know what he was doing. His ability to gain my trust and the trust of my parents, his grooming and carefully calculated brazen sexual assault, was the result of deliberate, premeditated, intentional and methodological patterns of abuse ― patterns that were rehearsed long before I walked through Larry’s exam room door and which continued to be perpetrated, I believe, on a daily basis for 16 more years, until I filed the police report. Larry’s the most dangerous type of abuser. One who is capable of manipulating his victims through coldly calculated grooming methodologies, presenting the most wholesome, caring external persona as a deliberate means to insure a steady stream of children to assault. And while Larry is unlikely to live past his federal sentence, he is not the only predator out there, and this sentence will send a message about how seriously abuse will be taken. So, I ask, how much is a little girl worth? How much priority should be placed on communicating that the fullest weight of the law will be used to protect another innocent child from the soul-shattering devastation that sexual assault brings? I submit to you that these children are worth everything. Worth every protection the law can offer. Worth the maximum sentence. The second aim of this court and our criminal justice system is to pursue justice for the victims that have already been harmed. And this aim too can only be realized by imposing the maximum sentence under the plea agreement, and in reaching this decision too, we also must answer the question, how much was a little girl worth? How much were these young women worth? This time, however, the little girls in question are not potential victims. They are real women and children, real women and little girls who have names and faces and souls. Real women and children whose abuse and suffering was enjoyed for sexual fulfillment by the defendant. I believe sometimes, your honor, that when we’re embroiled in a legal dispute, the words of our legal system designed to categorize and classify and instruct can inadvertently sterilize the harsh realities of what has taken place. They can serve as a shield against the horror of what we are really discussing. And this must not ever happen. Because the truth about what Larry has done must be realized to its fullest depth if justice is to ever be served. And so, for a moment, your honor, I, like every woman who’s come before you, want to take a moment to drop that shield. Larry meticulously groomed me for the purpose of exploiting me for his sexual gain. He penetrated me, he groped me, he fondled me. And then he whispered questions about how it felt. He engaged in degrading and humiliating sex acts without my consent or permission. And Larry enjoyed it. Larry sought out and took pleasure in little girls and women being sexually injured and violated because he liked it. And as I and so many other women and little girls were being violated, Larry found sexual satisfaction in our suffering. As we were being sexually violated even as very young children, as young as 6 years old, Larry was sexually aroused by our humiliation and our pain. He asked us how it felt because he wanted to know. What was done to myself and these other women and little girls, and the fact that our sexual violation was enjoyed by Larry, matters. It demands justice, and the sentence you impose today will send a message about how much these precious women and children are worth. You have seen our pictures, your honor ― moments in time captured when they were young and vulnerable and violated. I think of the young girl that I was and the little girls and young women all of these survivors were every day. I feel like I see them in the faces of my two precious daughters. When I watch my daughters’ eyes light up as they dance to “The Nutcracker,” I remember the little girl that I and all of these women used to be. The sparkle their eyes must have had, as mine did, before their innocence was taken. I watched my daughters love and trust unreservedly and I remember the long road that it has been to let myself love and be loved without fear. I think of the scars that still remain for all of us. One of the worst parts of this entire process was knowing, as I began to realize what had happened to me, how many other little girls had been left destroyed, too. I was barely 15 when Larry began to abuse me, and as I lay on the table each time and try to reconcile what was happening with the man Larry was held out to be, there were three things I was very sure of. First, it was clear to me this was something Larry did regularly. Second, because this was something Larry did regularly, it was impossible that at least some women and girls had not described what was going on to officials at MSU and USAG. I was confident of this. And third, I was confident that because people at MSU and USAG had to be aware of what Larry was doing and had not stopped him, there could surely be no question about the legitimacy of his treatment. This must be medical treatment. The problem must be me. And because I had friends who were physical therapists who practiced legitimate internal pelvic floor techniques, I also knew at 15 that to practice this, you must have specialized training and certification. Surely anyone who had heard that Larry was penetrating little girls would have demanded to know where he got his training, and if there was any question, he would’ve never been allowed near me. And so, I lay still and on the first two points, I was right. It was something he did often. And others had described Larry’s treatment before. In fact, though I didn’t know it at the time, four girls and women had described in detail to three different athletic departments at MSU what he was doing and his penetration and their belief that they had been sexually assaulted. It was reported to Kathie Klages, MSU’s head gymnastics coach, to a track coach and to multiple athletic trainers and supervisors years before I walked into Larry’s door. But I was wrong in my third belief. I was wrong that surely, if someone had been made aware of what Larry was doing, they would report it and ensure it was legitimate before ever allowing him near another child. I did not know when I was 15 that in 1997, three years before I walked into Larry’s exam room, that MSU’s head gymnastics coach, Kathie Klages, had waved a report form in front of Larissa Boyce after being told by two separate gymnasts of what Larry was doing and told Larissa there would be consequences for her if she reported.I did not know that Tiffany Thomas Lopez had reported the penetration and sexual assault to athletic trainer Destiny Teachnor-Hauk and to other athletic trainers and supervisors two years before I walked into Larry’s door. I did not know that Christie Achenbach had reported the penetration and sexual assault to her track coach and her athletic trainers and had also been silenced a full year before I walked into Larry’s door. I did not know that Jennifer Bedford had also reported to Destiny Teachnor-Hauk and asked if she could file a report that Larry’s treatment made her feel uncomfortable and that she had also been silenced. I believed the adults at MSU surrounding Larry would do the right thing if they were aware of what Larry was doing, and I was terribly wrong. And discovering that I could not only not trust my abuser but I could not trust the people surrounding him has been devastating. It is part of the consequences of sexual assault, and it needs to be taken seriously. I did not know that at the same time Larry was penetrating me, USAG was systematically burying reports of sexual assault against member coaches in a file cabinet instead of reporting them, creating a culture where predators like Larry and so many others in the organization, up to the highest-level coaches, were able to sexually abuse children, including our Olympians, without any fear of being caught. I did not know that, contrary to my belief, the elite gymnasts whose pictures were plastered on Larry’s wall were far from protected. That USAG, rather than supervising Larry, was allowing him to treat these girls in their own beds without even having a medical license in Texas. I did not know any of these things, and so as Larry was abusing me each time, I assured myself it must be fine because I thought I could trust the adults around me. My misplaced trust in my physician and my misplaced trust in the adults around me were wielded like a weapon, and it cost me dearly. And it follows me everywhere. I would like to take a moment now to address both organizations whose failures led to my sexual assault, because it is part of the consequences that I now carry. ... MSU, we have been telling our stories for more than 18 months, and you have yet to answer a single question I have asked. Every time I repeat these facts about the number of women who reported to employees at MSU and were silenced, you respond the exact same way. You issue a press statement saying there is no cover-up because no one who heard the reports of assaults believed that Larry was committing abuse. You play word games saying you didn’t know because no one believed. I know that. And the reason everyone who heard about Larry’s abuse did not believe it is because they did not listen. They did not listen in 1997 or 1998 or 1999 or 2000 or 2004 or 2014. No one knew, according to your definition of know, because no one handled the reports of abuse properly. Victims were silenced, intimidated, repeatedly told it was medical treatment and even forced to go back for continued sexual assault. You have stated in a motion to dismiss our civil suit that, ironically, is being heard right now in court as I am speaking, that the reports that were given in 97, ’98, ’99 and 2000 to track coaches, head gymnastic coaches and athletic trainers and supervisors don’t, quote, count as notice because these teenagers didn’t report it to the right official. The 14-year-old didn’t go to the right person. You have stated that no reports of sexual assault count as notice unless it is reported to a person who is capable of firing the alleged perpetrator. This entirely contradicts the letter that president Simon sent all 11,000 MSU employees in 2012, reminding them that MSU policy requires them to report any suspected child abuse and any allegations of sexual assault against someone at MSU. So, MSU, which is it? Do your employees have a duty to protect children or not? It has been 18 months, and I am still asking the same questions, hoping that the little girls that come after me will have adults that they can trust. And I’ve been getting the same answer for a year, and so I am asking point-blank again, when Kathie Klages humiliated Larissa Boyce and the second gymnast, greatly compounding the trauma of their sexual assault, and waved the report form in front of her telling her there would be consequences if she reported. Is this the right way or the wrong way to handle sexual assault allegations on MSU campus? When Tiffany Thomas Lopez reported her abuse to athletic trainers and supervisors and the trainers used the emotional pain Tiffany was in after her father’s death to convince her it would be too exhausting and painful to bother filing a report, was it the right way or the wrong way to handle a report of sexual assault on MSU campus? When Christie Achenbach reported the sexual assault to her track coach and athletic trainers and was also silenced, was it the right way or the wrong way to handle the report of sexual assault on MSU’s campus? When Kyle Stevens’ parents reported Larry’s sexual abuse of their daughter to a MSU psychiatrist and he brought Larry in to talk to her parents instead of reporting, as he was mandated to do by law, was it the right way or the wrong way to handle a report of sexual assault on MSU’s campus? When Amanda Thomas Shaw reported to the Title IX office, and Larry could hand-pick the four colleagues to be interviewed to determine whether his treatment was legitimate, was that the right way or the wrong way to investigate a claim of sexual assault on MSU’s campus? And after all this, when I came forward in 2016, I brought an entire file of evidence with me. I made a police report and a Title IX report, and I brought with me to those reports my medical records showing that Larry had never tried pelvic floor techniques. I brought medical records from a nurse practitioner documenting my graphic disclosure of abuse way back in 2004. I had my journals showing the mental anguish I had been in since the assault. A catalog of national and international medical articles showing what real pelvic floor treatment looks like. I brought a letter from a neighboring district attorney vouching for my character and truthfulness and urging detectives to take my case seriously. I brought a cover letter going point by point through Michigan law and case law, explaining how every element of first-degree criminal sexual assault was met and could be proven. I brought a witness I had disclosed it to in 2004. I brought evidence of two more women unconnected to me who were also claiming sexual assault. And I have the names of three pelvic floor experts willing to speak on my behalf. And the MSPD handled it beautifully, but MSU officials were a different story, because the response of Dean William Strampel was to send an email to Larry that day and tell him, quote, good luck, I am on your side. And when my video testimony to the IndyStar came out, graphically describing the abuse that Larry perpetrated, disclosing horrific details to the world that no one was ever supposed to know, that I had never told anyone, even my own husband, until that point, Dean Strampel forwarded that video testimony to the MSU provost, and he mocked it. He called it the cherry on the cake of his day. President Simon and board of trustees, is this the right way to handle disclosures of abuse on MSU’s campus? When Brooke Lemmen, one of the doctors Larry was allowed to hand-pick to clear himself in 2014, was interviewed for my investigation, she said I hadn’t really been penetrated ― I only thought I had, because, quote, when I am a 15-year-old girl, I think everything between my legs is my vagina. I only thought Larry had put his fingers in me for up to 40 minutes at a time for a full year. I was just confused. Sounds eerily familiar to what Amanda Thomas Shaw was told in 2014 that she, quote, didn’t understand the nuanced differences between sexual assault and a medical exam. It sounds eerily familiar to what every single woman was told all the way back to 1997. We were all wrong. We were all just confused. Board of trustees, is this the right way to handle disclosures of sexual assault on MSU’s campus? And if that were not bad enough, when I finally joined the civil suit five months later, after waiting for almost half a year for MSU to do the right thing, the vice president of the board of trustees, Joel Ferguson, went on television and gave a press interview in which he claimed those of us who have filed lawsuits were ambulance chasers who were looking for a payday. In fact, I know that at least one other high-ranking MSU official has specifically called me out by name and said I’m in it for the money. This has never been contradicted, retracted or refuted. MSU, you need to realize that you are greatly compounding the damage done to these abuse victims by the way you are responding. This, what it took to get here, what we had to go through for our voices to be heard because of the responses of the adults in authority, has greatly compounded the damage we suffer. And it matters. We have waited 18 months to be told no, this is not how we handle this on MSU’s campus. But instead, everyone has doubled down on the claim that nothing was done wrong and the only conclusion that can be reached is that no one truly sees anything wrong with any of this. And that is terrifying. And it leaves me terrified for the little girls of the future, who we are here to protect. And because of this willful ignorance, victim silencing and mishandling of sexual assault reports against Larry in ’97, ’98 and ’99, I walked through Larry’s door in 2000 and never walked out the same. Not long after I stopped seeing Larry, I transitioned from athlete to coach. And every day that I nurture those baby gymnasts, I wondered if any of them would find their way into his exam room. When one of my little girls was finally referred to him, I took a chance and I spoke up and I was kindly cautioned for my own sake to remain silent. My little baby gymnast was sent to Larry before I even knew a decision had been made to do so. Her family moved away almost immediately thereafter and I wept for that little girl and I prayed to God that she was under the age range that Larry preferred. She was 7. But when I filed my police report, Kyle Stevens came forward, and she was 6 ― a year younger than my little girl. And I cried in my kitchen, and I don’t know yet if that little girl walked out the same that she walked in. I transitioned from coaching to working in public policy, and I fought fear every time I had to commute or work close quarters with my male colleagues. I dreaded working on current event or legislation on sexual assault because I knew the memories that would come with it. I still watched gymnastics, but I looked away whenever the cameras panned to the sidelines in case Larry would be there. I wondered almost daily if there was ever a chance my voice would be heard. I began law school was I was 19. And I wrapped up in blankets every time I studied torts or crimes related to sexual assault and I hoped my face wouldn’t betray me in classroom discussions. I researched internal pelvic floor procedures and I tried to find out what had happened to me, and I watched for any sign that I would ever be believed.I met my future husband and I told him what I never wanted to tell anyone, and I wondered if he would walk away, and he didn’t. But I couldn’t even hold his hand or look up at him, because closeness wasn’t safe and trust wasn’t safe. We got married, and my 25th birthday came and went, and I sat up for nights before, believing my ability to file a police report would end on that birthday. I didn’t know the statute of limitations had been lifted. I woke up the morning I turned 25, and instead of feeling joy at a milestone, I only felt hopelessness and grief, because I thought my chance to stop this man was over. I thought daily about all the little women and girls walking in his office and I wondered if it would ever, ever end. I became a mother three times over, and the fear that hung over each birth, knowing I would be vulnerable in a medical setting, cast a horrific shadow over what should have been an occasion of pure joy. And I watched for a chance to be believed and I waited. I held my firstborn and then my two daughters, and each time I did, Larry, I remember the day you brought [your daughter] into your office so that I could hold her. You knew how much I loved children and you used your own daughter to manipulate me. And every time I held my babies, I prayed to God you would leave your abuse in the exam room and not take it home to the little girl born with black hair just like her daddy. And then the IndyStar story came out about the rampant cover-up at USAG, and I knew this was the chance and I wrote them immediately. But because of what Larry did, the cost of making it end has been incredibly high. And the effects of Larry’s abuse has been redoubled in the effort that I took to stop him. Choosing to live those moments over and over, daily, releasing every shred of privacy that I had, living with the reality that not only didn’t I get to choose what you did, but now I didn’t get to choose who knew about it. Even my status as a sexual assault victim has impacted or did impact my ability to advocate for sexual assault victims, because once it became known that I too had experienced sexual assault, people close to me used it as an excuse to brush off my concerns when I advocated for others who had been abused, saying I was just obsessed because of what I had gone through, that I was imposing my own experience upon other institutions who had massive failures and much worse. My advocacy for sexual assault victims, something I cherished, cost me my church and our closest friends three weeks before I filed my police report. I was left alone and isolated. And far worse, it was impacted because when I came out, my sexual assault was wielded like a weapon against me. Often by those who should have been the first to support and help, and I couldn’t even do what I loved best, which was to reach out to others. I was subjected to lies and attacks on my character, including very publicly by attorney Shannon Smith when I testified under oath. I was being attacked for wanting fame and attention, for making up a story to try to get money. Your Honor, since these attacks were made on my character very publicly on public record, I would like to take an opportunity briefly now to correct them. Out of the two women in question that day, Ms. Smith and I, who were attempting to communicate through either questions or answers, I would like to note that only one of us was taking pictures of the courtroom on her cell phone. Only one of us posed for the press and said, quote, I feel like I should say cheese. And out of the two of us, only one of us was making money off her court appearance that day. I don’t feel the need to say anything else. I think I’ve communicated completely. The cost, emotional and physical, to see this through has been greater than many would ever know. And Larry, I don’t need to tell you what the cost of your abuse has been to me, because you got to read my journals, every word of them. Because those had to go into evidence to make this happen.I want you to understand why I made this choice, knowing full well what it was going to cost to get here and with very little hope of ever succeeding. I did it because it was right. No matter the cost, it was right. And the farthest I can run from what you have become is to daily choose what is right instead of what I want. You have become a man ruled by selfish and perverted desires, a man defined by his daily choices repeatedly to feed that selfishness and perversion. You chose to pursue your wickedness no matter what it cost others, and the opposite of what you have done is for me to choose to love sacrificially, no matter what it costs me. In our early hearings, you brought your Bible into the courtroom and you have spoken of praying for forgiveness. And so it is on that basis that I appeal to you. If you have read the Bible you carry, you know the definition of sacrificial love portrayed is of God himself loving so sacrificially that he gave up everything to pay a penalty for the sin he did not commit. By his grace, I, too, choose to love this way. You spoke of praying for forgiveness. But Larry, if you have read the Bible you carry, you know forgiveness does not come from doing good things, as if good deeds can erase what you have done. It comes from repentance, which requires facing and acknowledging the truth about what you have done in all of its utter depravity and horror, without mitigation, without excuse, without acting as if good deeds can erase what you have seen in this courtroom today. If the Bible you carry says it is better for a stone to be thrown around your neck and you thrown into a lake than for you to make even one child stumble. And you have damaged hundreds. The Bible you speak carries a final judgment where all of God’s wrath and eternal terror is poured out on men like you. Should you ever reach the point of truly facing what you have done, the guilt will be crushing. And that is what makes the gospel of Christ so sweet. Because it extends grace and hope and mercy where none should be found. And it will be there for you. I pray you experience the soul crushing weight of guilt so you may someday experience true repentance and true forgiveness from God, which you need far more than forgiveness from me ― though I extend that to you as well. Throughout this process, I have clung to a quote by C.S. Lewis, where he says, my argument against God was that the universe seems so cruel and unjust. But how did I get this idea of just, unjust? A man does not call a line crooked unless he first has some idea of straight. What was I comparing the universe to when I called it unjust? Larry, I can call what you did evil and wicked because it was. And I know it was evil and wicked because the straight line exists. The straight line is not measured based on your perception or anyone else’s perception, and this means I can speak the truth about my abuse without minimization or mitigation. And I can call it evil because I know what goodness is. And this is why I pity you. Because when a person loses the ability to define good and evil, when they cannot define evil, they can no longer define and enjoy what is truly good. When a person can harm another human being, especially a child, without true guilt, they have lost the ability to truly love. Larry, you have shut yourself off from every truly beautiful and good thing in this world that could have and should have brought you joy and fulfillment, and I pity you for it. You could have had everything you pretended to be. Every woman who stood up here truly loved you as an innocent child, real genuine love for you, and it did not satisfy.I have experienced the soul satisfying joy of a marriage built on sacrificial love and safety and tenderness and care. I have experienced true intimacy in its deepest joys, and it is beautiful and sacred and glorious. And that is a joy you have cut yourself off from ever experiencing, and I pity you for it. I have been there for young gymnasts and helped them transform from awkward little girls to graceful, beautiful, confident athletes and taken joy in their success because I wanted what was best for them. And this is a joy you have cut yourself off from forever because your desire to help was nothing more than a facade for your desire to harm. I have lived the deep satisfaction of wrapping my small children up in my arms and making them feel safe and secure because I was safe, and this is a rich joy beyond what I can express, and you have cut yourself off from it, because you were not safe. And I pity you for that. In losing the ability to call evil what it is without mitigation, without minimization, you have lost the ability to define and enjoy love and goodness. You have fashioned for yourself a prison that is far, far worse than any I could ever put you in, and I pity you for that. And this is also why in many ways, your honor, the worst part of this process was each name, each number who came forward to the police with each Jane Doe, I saw my little girls and the little girls that were. The little girls who walked into Larry’s office that I could not save because no one wanted to listen. And while that is not my guilt, it is pain I still carry and pain I share with them. I cried for them, and with every tear that fell I wondered who is going to find these little girls, who is going to tell them how much they are worth, how valuable they are, how deserving of justice and protection? Who is going to tell these little girls that what was done to them matters? That they are seen and valued, that they are not alone and they are not unprotected? And I could not do that, but we are here now, and today that message can be sent with the sentence you hand down, you can communicate to all these little girls and to every predator to every little girl or young woman who is watching how much a little girl is worth. I am asking that we leave this courtroom ... knowing that when Larry was sexually aroused and gratified by our violation, when he enjoyed our suffering and took pleasure in our abuse, that it was evil and wrong. I ask that you hand down a sentence that tells us that what was done to us matters, that we are known, we are worth everything, worth the greatest protection the law can offer, the greatest measure of justice available. And to everyone who is watching, I ask that same question: How much is a little girl worth? Larry said in court that he hoped education and learning would happen from this tragedy, and I share that hope, and this is what we need to learn. Look around the courtroom, remember what you have witnessed these past seven days. This is what it looks like when someone chooses to put their selfish desires above the safety and love for those around them, and let it be a warning to us all and moving forward as a society. This is what it looks like when the adults in authority do not respond properly to disclosures of sexual assault. This is what it looks like when institutions create a culture where a predator can flourish unafraid and unabated, and this is what it looks like when people in authority refuse to listen, put friendships in front of the truth, fail to create or enforce proper policy and fail to hold enablers accountable. This is what it looks like. It looks like a courtroom full of survivors who carry deep wounds. Women and girls who have banded together to fight for themselves because no one else would do it. Women and girls who carry scars that will never fully heal but who have made the choice to place the guilt and shame on the only person to whom it belongs, the abuser. But may the horror expressed in this courtroom over the last seven days be motivation for anyone and everyone no matter the context to take responsibility if they have failed in protecting a child, to understand the incredible failures that led to this week and to do it better the next time. Judge Aquilina, I plead with you as you deliberate the sentence to give Larry, send a message that these victims are worth everything. In order to meet both the goals of this court. I plead with you to impose the maximum sentence under the plea agreement because everything is what these survivors are worth. Thank you. Need help?

"Joy Reid has apologized for writing anti-LGBTQ posts on her old blog, but she still has not answered important questions about her honesty and journalistic integrity. A weeklong saga surrounding her claims that The Reid Report, her now-defunct blog, was subject to a cyberattack culminated with the MSNBC host apologizing ― once again ― for previously espousing homophobic positions. The host of “AM Joy” said on air Saturday that her opinions have evolved since writing “offensive” statements several years ago. She echoed an apology she delivered in December after screenshots surfaced of blog posts she wrote between 2007 and 2009 that accused a former Florida governor of being a closeted gay man. Many of her most vocal supporters online have enthusiastically accepted her apologies, concluding ― and rightly so ― that people should be allowed to re-examine their beliefs over time.  What stands out, though, is the ease with which her supporters have accepted her hacking claims, ignoring monumental gaps in plausibility. After screenshots appearing to capture dozens of her past homophobic blog posts were tweeted the previous week, Reid told Mediaite last Monday that she didn’t author the posts. According to her initial statement, “an unknown, external party accessed and manipulated material ... to include offensive and hateful references.” Reid said that the newly revealed content “seems to be part of an effort to taint my character with false information.” “I can state unequivocally that it does not represent the original entries,” she said. “I hope that whoever corrupted the site recognizes the pain they have caused, not just to me, but to my family and communities that I care deeply about: LGBTQ, immigrants, people of color and other marginalized groups.” But the hacking claims fell apart under scrutiny from several media outlets. Documents and statements provided to HuffPost by Reid’s hired cybersecurity consultant, Jonathan Nichols, failed to prove Reid’s blog had been hacked or that the disputed posts were in fact fraudulent.  What’s more, these homophobic statements Reid has been accused of writing aren’t a major departure from what she’s already owned up to, nor are they far from the liberal blogging norms of the mid-2000s, as Richard Kim noted in The Nation. Nichols also told HuffPost that the alleged posts captured in the recent batch of screenshots never existed on Reid’s blog. But HuffPost and other outlets found this simply wasn’t true. You can view the alleged posts in full here. Many of Reid’s followers either cast doubt on reports calling into question the veracity of her hacking claims or pledged unwavering support even if the claims proved untrue. Reid returned to her show this Saturday, after nearly a week of noticeable silence on her social media pages. She addressed the alleged hacking, saying her hired cybersecurity experts could not prove it happened, but that she doesn’t think she wrote the posts. “When a friend found them in December and sent them to me, I was stunned,” Reid said. “Frankly, I couldn’t imagine where they’d come from or whose voice that was. In the months since, I’ve spent a lot of time trying to make sense of these posts.” “I hired cybersecurity experts to see if somebody had manipulated my words or my former blog, and the reality is they have not been able to prove it,” she continued. “But here’s what I know: I genuinely do not believe I wrote those hateful things because they are completely alien to me. But I can definitely understand based on things I have tweeted and have written in the past why some people don’t believe me.” Her comments appeared in stark contrast to her initial statement. .@MSNBC's Joy Reid addresses homophobic blog posts:""I genuinely do not believe I wrote those hateful things ... But I can definitely understand, based on things I have tweeted and have written in the past, why some people don't believe me."" pic.twitter.com/PWjdPfs5KB Reid apologized for her past anti-trans comments about conservative host Ann Coulter, who Reid called a “dude” and a “drag queen” on Twitter in 2011. She explained that she grew up in a household that had “conservative views” on the LGBTQ community. The next 30 minutes or so of Saturday’s show were dedicated to discussion with a panel of LGBTQ activists on the ways “hurtful speech” imperils marginalized communities. Reid did not say whether her hired cybersecurity experts were continuing to investigate the alleged hacking, nor did she provide new details about the FBI’s alleged investigation into the matter, as confirmed by her attorney Wednesday. She did not address the posts at all during her show Sunday, nor did any of her guests bring them up. Support from Reid’s defenders, including several MSNBC reporters, flooded Twitter over the weekend. Everyone of us will walk in @JoyAnnReid ‘s shoes some day - filled with remorse and regret over something we have said or done, but I predict that few will do so this eloquently. Sending support and admiration to you and your amazing panel and team @JoyAnnReid https://t.co/qV26Rcy6D9 I’m with @NicolleDWallace and @JoyAnnReid here: https://t.co/ElgsQaBcVf Brains, guts, heart and soul -- beloved Joy Reid has always been a treasured and brilliant colleague, but I've never been prouder to work with her than I am now. https://t.co/J95uL3CjMv Big Love to @JoyAnnReid AND her brave panel for taking this issue head on and moving our understanding of LGBTQ issues forward I support my friend @JoyAnnReid. I cannot speak for the LGBTQ communities who were surely hurt, but I considered this apology to be thoughtful and humble. I hope that it, and the discussion that followed on her Saturday show, were helpful. Nothing to add. pic.twitter.com/RSEfzXXRdY Joy Ann Reid apology.  Appropriate.  Heartfelt. This unique and compelling voice for tolerance and equality should not be silenced. We learn - and change - from our mistakes.  She has. It is striking ― and disturbing ― that Reid’s colleagues and her employer aren’t demanding answers about her seemingly contradictory statements on the alleged hacking. In her initial statement, Reid said a cybersecurity expert had “identified ... unauthorized activity” on her blog that resulted in numerous “fabricated” posts. But on Saturday, Reid said her hired experts couldn’t prove it.  MSNBC has not publicly released a statement supporting Reid. On Sunday, a MSNBC spokesman told NPR’s David Folkenflik that network executives “remain supportive of Reid.” MSNBC had basically been silent on Joy Reid. Here's statement from MSNBC spokesman today: ""MSNBC executives remain supportive of Reid. They believe she did well in her statement on her show on Saturday and have noted the large outpouring of positive support she’s received."" To be clear: this is not an *official* network statement. It does reflect direct remarks of MSNBC exec offering mindset of MSNBC brass. A representative for MSNBC declined to provide HuffPost with evidence suggesting Reid’s blog had been subject to “unauthorized activity,” as Reid claimed in her initial statement. Nichols did not respond to a request for additional comment. MSNBC also hasn’t responded to a request for comment about whether the network is conducting an internal investigation into Reid’s story. If the network can’t be trusted to seek truth in its own organization, how can it expect its viewers to trust it to seek truth from the highest levels of the government? Memory is malleable, and it’s possible that Reid, when first confronted with the latest batch of screenshots, genuinely believed that she did not write them. But as a journalist and public intellectual, she had an obligation to thoroughly examine whether she wrote the items that she now views as hateful. Instead, she waved away this responsibility by declaring that she does not “believe” she wrote them. At a time when the press is routinely attacked by the Trump administration, integrity should be of the utmost importance to every media organization. Reid is obviously well-liked by liberals, and as a female political analyst of color she offers a voice that’s often underrepresented on cable news. Surely people needn’t condemn Reid’s character to eternal damnation over this incident, but the public can ― and should ― demand transparency and truth from journalists. As some of Reid’s most high-profile defenders have noted in the past, our democracy depends on it. This article has been updated to note that an MSNBC spokesman’s comment to NPR was not an official statement from the network.",voice,silenced,tolerance
"Some people dream of becoming famous, or winning the lottery, or becoming a size 2 just in time for their high school reunion. Some people dream about becoming an opera singer and traveling all around the world, singing in historical theaters and sipping cappucinos in piazzas and hefeweizen in beer gardens. I did dream about those things once upon a time, but found that while I was doing them, I was dreaming of something else as well -- and that was working behind the scenes at an American opera company in order to work towards changing the way opera is perceived in this country. I know, it sounds like an annoyingly lofty goal, but when you've spent the number of years I have living with this art form (I started taking legitimate singing lessons from a retired opera singer when I was nine years old), when you've had the opportunity to experience the transformative power of this particular type of music theater over and over, while simultaneously feeling that almost nobody you meet in airports and shopping malls has any concept of what you do much less  how much power the unamplified voice can have,  you dare to dream big.  So for all these years that I've been lucky enough to get to fulfill my first dream, and get to collaborate with amazing musicians and conductors and directors all over the world, I've been dreaming about how I was going to fulfill this second dream - this nagging responsibility I felt to be part of the solution of bringing opera to more people - especially to more Americans, where the cultural history of opera just doesn't exist as part of our national discourse. I haven't exactly been very secretive about this dream of mine - I was constantly quizzing every General or Artistic Director who would give me a few minutes of their time about what worked and what didn't, and more publicly, I started writing editorial articles about Arts Advocacy for this little publication you are reading right now. With a national platform, I just couldn't keep my mouth shut about why The Arts matter in this country right now more than ever, why we need to work harder to bring this particular art form to more people's attention, and how we can go about doing that.  Which is what brings me to today's announcement; I have accepted a position at The Center for Contemporary Opera in New York City as the company's very first Director of Artistic Development. In addition to my ongoing singing career, I will be  overseeing development and marketing campaigns seeking to increase the financial stability and visibility of CCO, as well as assisting with future artistic and strategic planning. In other words, I finally get to work at an opera company doing the one thing I might be even more passionate about than singing; bringing opera to as many people as possible. The Center for Contemporary Opera is a particularly good fit for me, since my singing career has allowed me the opportunity to observe first hand the power contemporary opera has in creating new opera audiences. When a story is told with music theater by living composers in a modern idiom in the audience's native language, it removes most of the barriers people generally associate with opera right off the bat. Not to mention supporting the works of living, working composers keeps opera alive and vibrant and pushes the art form forward in immeasurable ways.  The Center for Contemporary Opera is now the second oldest opera company currently operating in Manhattan (only the Metropolitan Opera is older). It was founded in 1982 by new music proponent Richard Marshall, who ran the company for 26 years without ever paying himself a salary. During that time he produced forty three fully staged operas including nine world premieres. He founded the company at a time when small ""start up"" opera companies were not the norm, and kept the company running and presenting new works as well as neglected contemporary operas that had already premiered, giving countless living composers the opportunity to have their works presented in New York City, as well as delivering opera theater to New York audiences that couldn't be seen elsewhere- all out of personal dedication and passion.  The Center currently produces everything from fully staged productions, some of which have toured to theaters in Europe, to first readings of new works with a few singers and a piano. It provides every part of new work development, from laboratory to finished product. It is one of only three companies in New York City employing a union orchestra, and has continued to operate despite the financial turmoil every single arts organization finds themselves facing since the economic crash of 2008. The current General and Artistic Director, James Schaeffer, is another passionate proponent of contemporary music who has taken the financial and economic hurdles everyone has struggled with in stride, finding creative solutions to continue to produce opera even during this challenging fiscal period. He is now ready to push the company forward and encourage a growth spurt, hence the hiring of yours truly.  I find it fascinating and a little frustrating that while directors and conductors often hold directorships and administrative positiions within opera companies, singers themselves rarely have the opportunity to continue to perform while contributing to the other side of the footlights. There is definitely a stigma attached -- that if you have time for any kind of other job, your singing career must not be going well. But I think we are also saddled with the problem that artists aren't taught enough social responsibility as part of their contribution to any art form. On the one hand, being an opera singer requires so many varied skills that it could certainly be seen as ""enough for one person to do."" However I firmly believe that in the current vortex of cultural unawareness, each artist must take some sort of responsibility to encourage the continuance of opera - if only so that we can have some jobs in the future! But more than that, we possess the knowledge of the extreme power of this combination of music and drama, and we have a responsibility to impart that knowledge to as many people as we can. Whether it be striking up conversations with strangers and encouraging them to check out a youtube clip, inviting other diners in the restaurant where you are eating to your upcoming performance, starting your own art song festival in your local library, or even working for an opera company in some capacity. The challenge of making sure opera remains a necessary artistic element of the 21st century in the United States belongs to all of us, and I am thrilled with my new opportunity to participate in this mission.",I,remains,mission
"Annie* was just 8 years old when her Southern Baptist parents started taking her to protest outside abortion clinics in Southern California. She marched in anti-abortion rallies, stood outside clinics with signs, and volunteered at crisis pregnancy centers.  Now, looking back at age 29, Annie wishes her parents hadn’t pushed her so hard to actively participate in a cause she didn’t quite understand at the time.  “I know, somewhere,” she told HuffPost, “there’s a picture of me holding a sign as a kid that read, ‘Would You Kill Me, Too?’” “[Being forced to protest at such a young age] made me yell slogans for an issue I did not comprehend, and I deeply regret the hurt I probably caused as a child,” said Annie. “I remember women walking past me into a clinic, crying when they saw me.” Annie’s experiences as a young child in the anti-abortion movement (if not her feelings about those experiences) are far from unique. Across the U.S., kids of all ages are woken up early on Saturday mornings and brought to local abortion clinics to protest with their parents. They pray, sing, pass out fliers, decorate sidewalks with chalk, or hold signs and posters. While passing down religious and political beliefs is a natural part of parenting, and certainly not a bad thing, many patients, companions, clinic escorts and abortion providers that HuffPost spoke to question the role children are pushed to play in the anti-abortion movement. While anti-abortion leaders see children as an integral part of their protesting strategies, abortion rights advocates see young people being used as pawns to harass women making private health care decisions. The anti-abortion movement has long used images of children in their marketing materials and posters. Protesters might carry posters featuring a baby or a young child’s face,  with words like, “Would you kill me, too?” overlaying the photo. Many volunteers at Crisis Pregnancy Centers pass out pamphlets and fliers outside abortion clinics that include photos of happy-looking families or smiling children.  But the role children play extends outside of appearing on posters. Kids are also leading prayers or engaging in group prayers led by religious leaders, speaking anti-abortion rhetoric into megaphones or microphones, and passing out literature from crisis pregnancy centers. There is perhaps no better manifestation of the movement’s use of children than last Saturday morning’s Youth For Life march in Charlotte, North Carolina, outside of A Preferred Women’s Health Center (APWHC), one of the biggest abortion providers in the south.  Love Life Charlotte, a conglomeration of churches in the Charlotte area who have come together to protest abortion access, was granted a parade permit by the city for Saturday morning for their Youth For Life march. According to Love Life Charlotte, about 40 churches bused in children of all ages to march outside the clinic.  Justin Reeder, the founder of Love Life Charlotte, told HuffPost that the event was an opportunity for youth members to “see how being pro-life is not just being against abortion but also offering love and life to those who feel abortion is their only option.” “As our nation continues to become more pro-life (Editor’s note: a recent Gallup poll showed that 49 percent of Americans currently identify as “pro-choice” while 46 percent identify as “pro-life”) it’s important for young people to see how much love and life the Church can bring to those who feel abortion is their only option,” Reeder said. “The youth are not engaging people, but rather praying that God ushers in a culture of love and life to a place where mothers feel so alone and afraid.”  The youth march drew close to 1,000 participants on Saturday, according to Love Life Charlotte. The patients and patient companions that HuffPost heard from said that the sheer number of people marching outside the clinic coupled with the noise that they were making ensured an overwhelming and distressing experience for anyone moving in and out of APWHC. Two volunteer clinic escorts were so upset by the number of children participating in the demonstration that they left in tears.  Though Reeder said that the aim of the march was not to “engage” with the clinic’s patients, the protest very much affected the appointments of APWHC’S  patients. Although the participants never touched any of the patients, they did address them, often directly.  At one point, a 17-year-old member of Love Life Charlotte wept into a microphone, begging women who she called “Mom,” not to murder their babies. A small group of kids performed live music into microphones so that their songs could be heard from inside the clinic. A Preferred Women’s Health Center is located at the bottom of Latrobe Drive, home to various local businesses on a wide two-lane road. Because Love Life Charlotte had been granted a parade permit, they were able to block off one of those lanes, thus disrupting the usual flow of traffic.  Members of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department were present to direct traffic and make sure members of all parties ― Love Life Charlotte, other anti-abortion groups, and Pro Choice Charlotte counter-protesters ― were abiding by all of the rules.  Calla Hales, clinic administrator at APWHC, has been skeptical of the police presence at these protests for a long time ― especially after an incident this summer in which members of CMPD were seen entertaining young kids from Love Life Charlotte while their parents prayed and protested outside APWHC. (HuffPost reached out to CMPD for comment about this incident and did not hear back in time for publication.) That moment when @cmpd decides to run a daycare & let protesters' kids hang out in their air conditioned SUVs while they harass patients. pic.twitter.com/NnwNeCVQY6 On Saturday morning, in preparation for the youth march, Hales had her staff pass out confidential questionnaires for patients to fill out once they’d made their way into the clinic. Just entering the clinic on Saturday meant passing not just the parade of children praying and singing at them, but also the usual gamut of aggressive protesters, and  the three mobile crisis pregnancy centers and their nurses who often try to divert traffic away from the clinic.  Of the 22 patients or patient companions who filled out the questionnaires, which were obtained by HuffPost, 12 of them said that the number of people on the street made them consider leaving their already-hard-to-get appointments.  One woman wrote, “I was scared to death of all those protesters.” Another person, who was a patient’s companion, commented, “I should not have to watch my friend be shamed and emotionally attacked for one of the hardest personal choices she has ever made.”   “They yelled into my car and embarrassed and upset my friend,” a second patient companion wrote on their feedback form. “Music ridiculously loud, able to hear inside the clinic. Very disturbing.”  And one woman, who had brought her daughter to the clinic, complained in her feedback form that on her way down Latrobe Drive to get to the clinic, she had been told by anti-abortion protesters to park “way way away from where I was supposed to be ― I am also handicapped.”  While Love Life Charlotte’s youth march was an extreme example of child-based anti-abortion demonstrating, children all over the country are party to anti-abortion protests at the behest of their parents and their parents’ religious groups. According to patients and clinic staffers that spoke to HuffPost, this participation sometimes crosses the line from simply attending a protest to engaging in harassment.  One volunteer clinic escort based in Atlanta, Karen, told HuffPost that at the clinic she volunteers at, she’s seen an increase in this kind of harassment since the 2016 election.   “Since the election, we have a group from Abolish Human Abortion (AHA) and they often bring at least one little girl to participate in holding giant signs and speaking into the wireless-amplified megaphone,” Karen said. “The little girl will read from the Bible or from an AHA script. It’s clear [these girls] have no real understanding of what they are reading.” Karen recalled an incident in which one of these young girls looked at her and called her “evil.” “With direct eye-contact she asked me, ‘Why are you doing this? Why do you want to make money off of murdering babies? Do you know you are evil? Do you know you will burn in hell?’” Karen told HuffPost. “It’s chilling to see young children used this way ... I’ve seen babies being carried as props, and toddlers tagging along as props with the AHA group.”  In Michigan at Northland Family Planning, one anti-abortion protester, Elvis Kesto, regularly brings his son, a toddler, to stand outside and protest with a sign that says, “Babies Are Murdered Here.” Kesto regularly posts photos of this onto his Facebook page. Jessica James, a clinic escort at Northland Family Planning, argues that forcing children to engage in the abortion debate outside clinics is akin to “religious and emotional abuse.” “My issue is with the long-term effects of what I consider to be religious and emotional abuse on a child that doesn’t have a choice in the matter,” Gird, who is training to be a social worker, told HuffPost.  Steven Meyers, clinical psychologist and professor of psychology at Roosevelt University in Chicago, told HuffPost children that young “have limited perspective taking abilities, so they will have difficulty understanding what others experience.”  “Their emerging cognitive abilities mean that they don’t understand the complexity of issues and are more likely to perceive events in black-and-white terms,” he said. “Their stage in moral development involves mainly pleasing their parents and avoiding punishment rather than having the ability at this point to grapple with abstract or complicated decisions.” In other words, anti-abortion protesters’ kids will follow the lead of their parents, regardless of the emotional consequences it will have on patients, because of their innate want to do right by their mother and father.  Of course, parents across the political spectrum encourage their kids to engage in political discourse. There were many children at the Women’s March on Washington the day after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, and many of their photos and posters went viral.  Meyers sees a clear difference between the Women’s March ― or any other peaceful march in a neutral space ― and anti-abortion protests, which often involve targeting individuals outside of clinics. “The main difference between [the Women’s March and anti-abortion protests] is the amount of conflict and negative emotion that children are exposed to at these events,” he said. “Peaceful and orderly marches have the advantage of allowing parents to share their values with their children in ways that are more likely to be constructive teaching experiences. High conflict demonstrations can become more volatile and potentially distressing to young children.”  Annie, whose political views have changed since she held signs outside her area abortion clinic, agrees with this assessment.  “I remember first hearing about the concept of abortion when I was 6, I believe, when Bill Clinton got elected,” Annie told HuffPost. “My parents said it was a crime, for he wanted to kill babies.” She also said that she’s had a hard time engaging in political demonstrations, because it brings back uncomfortable memories.  “I tried to attend an anti-Trump [protest] recently, and almost had a panic attack at the yelling, because it reminded me of the hurt I probably caused as a kid,” she said. “Whenever I see kids in any sort of political protest now, I just want to hug them and hide them away, even if I fundamentally agree with the idea they’re protesting.”  By 11am on Saturday, after the Youth For Life rally and over an hour of marching and praying in the humid North Carolina end-of-summer heat, two young girls from Love Life Charlotte fainted.  The two young teenagers were too faint to stand up. They were both ultimately fine, but the rest of Love Life Charlotte, including Reeder, carried on up the hill to finish their parade, while only a handful of youths and a couple of adults waited with the girls.  As all of this was happening, a member of another anti-choice group, Cities4Life, yelled prayers into a microphone, and begged women to come out of the clinic.  “Abortion is child abuse,” he said.  *Names have been changed ",march,drew,Charlotte
"Mr. Primrose hated pigeons. Although we never discussed this, my neighbor’s feelings of contempt for the maligned winged creatures became clear, after I was awakened by the popping sound of gunshots, as he picked them off the neighborhood roofs. Our roof, a pigeon-friendly haven for the unwanted, vagabond birds, became a popular target for our avian-murdering neighbor. He wasn’t that crazy about Jewish people either. Although we also never discussed this, being a rather bright child, I came to this astute conclusion shortly after he chased me and my cousin while wielding a large stick, as he threatened us with a slew of vile Anti-Semitic slurs.  Though there was no actual prize awarded for the team that made it to home base first, our family, a little on the competitive side, played all games with the same fervor often reserved for championship wrestling and roller derby matches. So while I knew we weren’t supposed to go near “Old Man Primrose’s Place,” I suspect the thrill of victory may have impacted our decision to cut through his yard during our weekly game of town chase. Fortunately for us, youth was on our side, and we were able to outrun our aged neighbor to the safety of our backyard, where he finally gave up chase. Donning denim overalls, a white crew neck t-shirt, sporting a gray buzz-cut, with his trusty rifle by his side, Primrose was a one-man soldier boy patrolling the neighborhood on perpetual high pigeon alert.  Although I hadn’t thought about our neighbor for years, I did today, on this crisp autumnal Big Apple morning, after being roused by a pair of pigeons planted on my window ledge, as I am now awakened most mornings at the crack of dawn by incessant bird babbling. And I thought about my father.  There’s little chance I’ll forget the look of anguish that overtook his face when I asked, “Dad, what’s a kike?” as I recounted our frightening encounter with our neighbor. My father’s silence spoke volumes as he promptly headed to the local police station to report the incident that would make an indelible imprint on how I would come to view the world.   No charges were pressed against Mr. Primrose, but he was put on notice. And so was I.  From then on, I had little difficulty following my father’s strict admonition to stay away from Primrose’s property. Surprisingly, our relationship with our neighbor wasn’t always loathsome.  It was during Passover the previous year that things changed dramatically, after he inadvertently learned that we were of the Hebrew persuasion. That evening, when he came to collect his pay for some yard work he had done for my father, he entered unannounced through the front door of our home, open in anticipation of the arrival of the beloved prophet, Elijah, with whom the future redemption of Israel is closely allied.  Our dining room, full with cousins, aunts, uncles, and my five siblings, was festive, with the men wearing yamakas and tallis. ”Please join us, Mr. Primrose.  We are celebrating Passover,” my father insisted, inviting our startled neighbor to join our Seder, to which he hastily declined and left. Fast forward, America 2016. I know I am not alone as I relive the trauma buried long ago; the hatred seething just below the underbelly, now bubbling over in Trump’s America, as hauntingly familiar scenes of rage and violence have resurfaced with a vengeance. Reports of anti-Semitic, racist, and anti-immigrant incidents have spread like wildfire; schools and colleges around the country report a surge in hate crimes, as a new generation enters an era of innocence lost. Like a cancer once contained, the seeds of hatred have begun their slow descent, cell by cell, dividing and conquering. To bear witness, we must speak the truth, once more. There is time; there is still time to tell the truth. I’m not really sure what happened to Mr. Primrose. During my freshman year of college while home on semester break, I noticed a “For Sale” sign on his property, and by the following summer, another family had moved into our neighbor’s house.   People come and go, and the subtle whisper of childhood demons revisit us from time to time. Mr. Primrose would become nothing more than a speck of dust in my universe.  Still, the frightened child of ten isn’t ever really far from me.  She shadows closely, hiding in dark recesses of gray matter, serving as a reminder of life’s fragility.  And while I don’t know much, I’ve learned that people punish themselves in ways I will never understand. I imagine that was Mr. Primrose’s fate. My days of racing to home base, have long been replaced by my race to the subway, hoping to make it to work on time.  These days, I’m making peace with a pair of pigeons who have taken up permanent residence on my window ledge. Like a distant and faded memory, the once cacophonous cooing has transformed into a serene and tranquil melody.",we,was,persuasion
" Photo credit: Jeffrey Hornstein ""Watch out,"" Janine Molinari laughs, flashing me a megawatt smile. ""They're gonna come at you!"" No sooner has the acclaimed choreographer-director-dance teacher spoken than her students, 20 of Broadway's finest child performers, come barreling toward me, spiraling backward and forward as their miniature feet tap out a glorious rhythm. Though I'm out of breath just watching these kids thunder through routine after routine, their obvious joy in the work is undeniably exhilarating.  Janine, a pixie-like dynamo in red tap shoes, has cultivated a private but immensely supportive atmosphere at Dance Molinari (DMO). With studios in New York and Los Angeles, DMO has become the go-to company for serious triple-threat juveniles who want to prep for auditions and shows in a collaborative, open hearted environment. Celebrities such as Ariana Grande and Nick Jonas began their careers as DMO students, and every young artist cycling through Janine's ""Super Saturday"" workshop is a literal Broadway baby.  ""It's a cross-section of kids,"" Molinari informs me. ""I do a ton of one-on-one coachings when the kids are in shows, so some of them don't come to the Saturday class for months because they come to me during the week.""  Of this morning's group, she says, ""The little ones have all been in Matilda or Annie; the teenagers in Billy Elliot or Mary Poppins."" (I recognize quite a few among the youthful assembly, including Rachel Resheff from Larry David's Fish in the Dark and veteran Broadway kid Matthew Gumley, best known outside theatre circles for his prolific voiceover work.) But no matter who shows up, Janine's infectious energy sets the tone. It's clear from her enthusiastic and motivational teaching style that Ms. Molinari is quite the opposite of Dance Moms' Abby Lee Miller; the doyenne of DMO likes to encourage her students with equal parts science, craft and good old TLC. ""Raise your hand if you need a friend!"" she calls out during a partner exercise. ""We're all friends here. This is not a competition."" She also frequently reminds them to smile, ""because smiling relaxes your body. Remember, you're not just dancers; you're also actors and singers, and your body needs to be relaxed so you can talk and sing while you're doing this."" Even knowing that these tweens and teens are pros, I'm still amazed to hear a 9-year-old calmly inquire, ""Can you break it down?"" when Janine introduces a new dance combination. However, his precocious comportment is the only thing calm about Super Saturday. The students remain in perpetual motion, jumping from basic warm-ups to synchronized routines to the finale from Footloose (which Molinari is directing and choreographing this season at Connecticut's Seven Angels Theatre). Though opportunities for tension abound, the mood is continually jovial. What's supposed to be work feels a whole lot more like a dance party. After class Janine and I chat over coffee, our conversation punctuated with raucous peals of laughter. (When you put two bubbly creative types together, hilarity inevitably ensues.) ""I never expected any of this,"" she confesses. ""Dance Molinari is in its 15th year, but it wasn't meant to be a business. It was meant to be fun."" From an early age Janine knew performing was her passion, but choreography became an obsession: ""I'd be getting ready for recitals and I'd redo my numbers. My mind always went back to seeing things in pictures or how we could change the movement or shape of something."" Her educational experience reflects this; Molinari, a Staten Island native, first enrolled at Flagler College in St. Augustine, Florida, where by her sophomore year she was choreographing the school's mainstage shows and teaching dance classes. Ever ambitious, she moved back to New York where she graduated from Wagner College and began booking Broadway and Off-Broadway national tours. In 2000, while playing in Tony 'n' Tina's Wedding, Janine's fellow cast members asked her to teach them to tap, which led to a fateful meeting one Thanksgiving weekend. I started doing a warm-up with my adults -- all I taught then were adults -- got a knock on the door, and found all these kids out in the hallway with their parents. They said, 'Our dance teacher didn't show up today. Can we take your class?' I said, 'I'm so sorry. I don't teach kids.' And they said, 'Well, can we take it just for today?' So I said, 'Sure, come on in.' Turns out they were in Annie Get Your Gun and all these big shows. They out-tapped the adults! After the class they asked if they could come back and they told more and more kids, and that's how the business grew. We've really been infiltrated with Broadway kids who are now pop stars and on TV shows. While Molinari's seen many students come and go, she admits retaining a soft spot for Ariana Grande:  Ariana is very special, with a smile that lights up any room. She's an extremely hard worker who takes her craft seriously, but at the same time is always looking to create something new. I have a very vivid memory of her bringing in the song 'Jai Ho' and being super excited for us to choreograph it! Sometimes bragging on her students draws Janine into her own adventures. Last year while in L.A., Molinari visited actor Dylan Snyder, a longtime DMO alum, on the set of the Disney series Kickin' It. During filming, Janine mentioned Snyder's tapping ability to the show's producers, who immediately decided to incorporate it into a new episode for Kickin' It's final season and invited her to choreograph a routine. (The episode, ""Bringing Down the House,"" aired in early March.) Choreographing for TV is really nice. I loved it because I had my script ahead of time and it's all done in a week. But it's just small sections; it's like a little play with a bit of dance here and there. With theatre, it's months of preparation. Theatre is a lot more work but it's more gratifying when the show goes up, because I'm part of the editing process. Doing TV was really fun, but I had no say in how [the number] looked in the end, so that was disappointing. They're just totally different beasts, but there are aspects of both that I love. That inner drive to control the editing process has led Molinari to some invigorating projects as choreographer and director, including the '80s throwback show Totally Tubular Time Machine with Debbie Gibson (Janine and I squeal over our mutual fondness for the icon, who's apparently the nicest person on the face of the planet) and this year's The Wildest, a revue based on the music of Louis Prima. Now Janine plans to take that control to the next level with her upcoming webseries Tap Out of It, an affectionate parody of life at DMO. I play 'Gina Marinara,' and there are actors playing all the different teachers. The series is basically the different experiences we have when we're getting ready for a show coming to Broadway, what happens when we get closer and closer to callbacks -- that's really what we're about here, getting the kids ready. But each webisode is going to be two to three minutes long and it will show off the kids' comic chops. We're poking fun at what we do and laughing at it. Molinari's buoyant approach to dance and life has come in handy outside of the studio too; she constantly uses her art for community outreach, doing cabarets to benefit the Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen and New Jersey's Popcorn Park Zoo, hosting a summer residency at the 92nd Street Y, and overseeing DMO's program Sole 2 Sole, which grants scholarships and donates tap shoes to underprivileged young artists.  ""I felt [DMO] needed a way to give back to the community,"" Janine explains. ""I started Sole 2 Sole because I wanted the kids to see how performing can touch the lives of those who can't afford to go to a Broadway show."" Janine knows the transformative power of performance better than anyone. Ultimately, it all comes down to love of the game and love of thy neighbors. ""I have a ton of kids who do great things,"" she says. ""They're really supportive of each other and they applaud when someone gets something. [Performing is] a hard living, but it should be part of their learning process and it should be fun."" And as long as there are teachers like Janine Molinari to encourage our young dreamers, you can bet it will be.",someone,'re,something
"One great mystery of Donald Trump’s rise to power involves the overwhelming support he received from white evangelicals during the 2016 campaign ― support he still enjoys despite his constant and easily verified lying, his attacks on the courts and the free press, his close associations with open racists, his aggressive pursuit of undocumented persons, and his support for a wretched health care policy. Yes, white evangelicals tend to be conservative, but one would hope their gospel values would reject dishonesty, authoritarianism, and cruelty.  So powerful is the evangelical affinity for Trumpism that dissenters face punishment. Look what’s happened to Russell Moore, the Southern Baptist ethicist who called out Trump’s “serious moral problems” and un-Christian personal behavior. Under withering pressure from his own denomination, Moore offered a public apology for being “overly broad” and “unnecessarily harsh” in his criticisms of Trump supporters. That apology might have saved Moore’s job, but it reveals the fierce support Trump enjoys among evangelicals. How do we explain the evangelical affinity for a movement that so obviously conflicts with Christian values? Some propose that evangelicals have fallen in love with political power. They’ve sold out themselves and their values in order to support a conservative agenda ― and to find themselves seated at the table when key decisions are made. Perhaps their pro-life convictions outweigh all other considerations, or maybe they’ve just corrupted themselves. Surely this criticism bears a measure of truth. We should not overlook another dimension of white evangelicals’ attachment to Trumpism: apocalypticism.   With respect to contemporary religion, scholars use words like apocalypticism and millennialism somewhat loosely. But these terms describe a widespread fixation among evangelicals with the end times, particularly the belief that we are currently living in the last days. Visit a Christian bookstore and you will likely find shelves devoted to “Bible prophecy,” explication of Revelation and other parts of the Bible that, they say, outline history’s climactic events. Even evangelicals who reject the Bible prophecy movement are often shaped by its values and tensions. We don’t have time here for a critique of evangelical millennialism. I’ve done it here, here, and here, and I’ve written textbooks on biblical apocalypticism. My point here is more straightforward: in significant ways, apocalypticism strengthens the evangelical affinity for Trumpism. First, American millenarians have long harbored strong suspicion of international and religious alliances. In part this suspicion goes back to old anti-Catholic sentiments, read in the light of key passages from Revelation. Chapters 13, 17, and 18 envision a great Beast who makes war against God’s people. All the “inhabitants of the earth” worship the Beast. The Beast has seven heads and 10 horns, often taken to represent an alliance of nation states. According to this logic, Revelation’s Beast stands for unholy political and religious alliances that will emerge just prior to the end. Watch out, World Bank and National Council of Churches! Both suspicions, religious and international, manifest themselves in popular millennialist sources. We find them in Hal Lindsey’s classic The Late Great Planet Earth, which was published in 1970 and was the top non-fiction bestseller of that decade, and in the incredibly popular Left Behind series of novels. The authors of the Left Behind series, Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, describe “three signs of the end”: “world government,” a “one-world economy,” and “a one-world religion.” Trumpism plays into these scripts at multiple levels. Trump’s campaign quickly built alliances with conservative evangelicals like Franklin Graham, Jerry Falwell Jr., and Paula White, but it largely ignored ecumenical and mainline Protestants. (Apocalypticists are especially suspicious of the ecumenical movement, which seeks to reunite Christians in the United States and around the world.) His Twitter relationship with Pope Francis has so many layers of complication that CNN recently summarized it in “A Tale of 10 Tweets.” Trump openly criticizes NATO and the United Nations, and his recent visit to Europe only undermined confidence in the United States among NATO allies. He has also rejected multi-lateral trade deals, threatening to back out of NAFTA and pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We saw a perfect example of Trumpism in the recent announcement that the United States is withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement. Trump offered a series of arguments for his decision, culminating with this claim: “our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America’s sovereignty.” Trump went on for several paragraphs concerning how the multi-lateral agreement placed the United States under the authority of other nations. Moreover, he characterized those other nations as taking advantage of the United States. At this point he conjured an image from his campaign: “We don’t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore.” Setting aside the question of Russia, Trumpism is fundamentally opposed to multi-national collaboration. A second affinity between Trumpism and apocalypticism involves dualism, the tendency to make rigid distinctions between good and evil. Dualism stands among the defining characteristics of apocalypticism, and it also characterizes Trumpian rhetoric. For example, on Memorial Day Trump lauded “those brave souls who raced into gunfire, roared into battle, and ran into hell to face down evil.” Surely American soldiers have confronted outright evil in great conflicts. But always? Were the Mexicans, the Spanish, and the Vietnamese “evil”? Memorial Day honors all who have died while in military service, but most of us would not characterize the Native American nations who resisted white expansion as evil. Would we? It’s not as if Trump’s Memorial Day line was a mild slip. Trumpism is all about naming enemies. Channeling Stalin, Trump has branded the news media as an “enemy of the people.” With a deeply polarized American electorate, Trump’s dualistic attacks appeal to his base. But it’s more than a matter of style. Trump’s intellectual guide Stephen Bannon has spoken of a “clash of civilizations” between a purportedly Judeo-Christian West and an Islamicist East. Bannon describes a centuries-long conflict with Islam, but his enemies are not only external. As any Breitbart reader could see during Bannon’s run as its executive chair, the enemies also include those who would erode the “Judeo-Christian” nationalist identity Bannon attributes to the United States. Given Bannon’s dualist view of society, Breitbart’s merciless attacks against religious and cultural opponents make sense. Trumpism is about enemies: remember Trump’s New Year’s Eve tweet? That tweet may have sent love and greetings, but it reveals Trump’s mindset. People who disagree are enemies, and that’s how he’ll treat them. Dualism almost always goes hand in hand with a persecution complex. Trump routinely complains about the mistreatment he receives from his various adversaries. As commencement speaker to the United States Coast Guard Academy, Trump whined, “No politician in history — and I say this with great surety — has been treated worse or more unfairly.” When Nordstrom’s pulled Ivanka Trump’s clothing line from its stores, Trump tweeted: “My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom.” Like Trump, evangelicals are prone to describe themselves as beset by hostile forces. Hard as it is to believe, white evangelicals today believe they suffer discrimination more intensely than do Muslims. A dualistic outlook is a gift that keeps on giving. Apocalyptic dualism stands in tension with another value evangelicals hold dear: grace. Trump’s candidacy posed many problems for evangelicals, not least his three marriages ― including dating future wives while still married. It didn’t help that Trump bragged about disrespecting women and grabbing women by their genitals. But evangelicals can forgive easily. During the campaign, multiple stories bubbled up that Trump had found Jesus. But with dualism, the grace that applies so easily to one’s allies cannot touch one’s enemies. Actual Christians like Bill and Hillary Clinton have never received grace from the evangelical world. Bill could never be forgiven despite his shows of repentance. And Hillary’s Christian testimony, like that of Barack Obama, could not be accepted because she was on the wrong side of evangelical politics. The apocalyptic stream runs a long, winding course through American history. Donald Trump appeals to American evangelicals for many reasons. Apocalyptic resonances within Trumpism made the man and his message especially palatable. Trumpism’s rejection of international and interreligious cooperation, combined with its tendency to demonize its opponents, touched a deep place in the evangelical mindset.",Trumpism,plays,levels
"An extremely rare species of frog has been classified into a genus previously known only through fossils, scientists declared this week.   In 1996, the Hula painted frog became the first amphibian officially considered extinct by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Originally discovered in the Hula Valley in 1943, the last confirmed sighting had been in 1955, more than 40 years before scientists finally decided to label the species as extinct. In 2011, a park ranger named Yoram Malka spotted one of the frogs in the Hula Valley Nature Reserve.  Since then, scientists have discovered up to 14 of the frogs, National Geographic reports. The IUCN has already redefined the frog from being “extinct” to “critically endangered” in 2012, but one detail of its classification remains outdated: The Hula painted frog is no longer considered to be a part of the Discoglossus genus.     Sarig Gafny, a scientist at the Ruppin Academic Center in Michmoret, Israel, conducted a study on the rediscovered species, published this week in Nature Communications journal. In addition to the exciting re-emergence of the frogs, new information came to light in Gafny’s study: The frog is not a member of the Discoglossus genus as previously thought, but instead is the last survivor of Latonia, an extinct amphibian genus previously known only through fossils.  ""Imagine that somewhere in north east Asia someone discovered a local species of elephants that was not known to science, and then, two years later, they present strong evidence that this elephant species is actually a mammoth,"" Professor Gafny explained to the Huffington Post in an email. ""I assume that finding a live mammoth would have been a striking piece of news."" Rebecca Biton, a paleontologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and co-author of the study, explained that the researchers decided to reclassify the frog after analyzing DNA and ancient frog bones. ""The Hula painted frog is not what we thought it was,"" Biton told LiveScience. According to Tablet Magazine, the Hula painted frog is indigenous to a location rich with history. Known as Merom in the Hebrew Bible, the location where Joshua supposedly defeated the Canaanites, the Hula Lake and surrounding marshlands were drained in the 1950s due to malarial concerns. Parts of the valley were flooded again and restored to become the Hula Valley Nature Reserve in the 1990s. ""Scientists tend to err on the side of caution before declaring something extinct, so we were pretty sure this frog was gone,"" said Robin Moore, the creative director of Amphibian Survival Alliance. ""[The re-discovery of the Hula Painted Frog is] a real testament to the resilience of nature.”",Parts,flooded,1990s
"Michael Bennett is of the NFL’s good guys. When teammate Cliff Avril ran a race last weekend to help raise money for juvenile Diabetes research, Bennett was there all day to offer his help. When Avril went to Haiti to build schools and help provide clean water, Bennett was there with his sleeves rolled up. He also takes many opportunities to visit juvenile detention centers and speak with kids. And, when former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick stunned sports fans by kneeling during the national anthem, Bennett decided to sit down ― with law enforcement and community leaders in Seattle to learn about what he could constructively do to help answer questions about race. This is why it’s surprising to see how Bennett has drawn the ire of prominent sports journalists, including ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith, as well as a local sports columnist. It’s unfair that his name was dragged through the mud. Bennett is a unique person and by all accounts a great person ― and he has done nothing wrong. In an article published two weeks ago in The Seattle Times, Matt Calkins heavily criticized the Seattle Seahawks star defensive end for lashing out at a local TV reporter who was questioning him after a game. Calkins didn’t contact the TV reporter before publishing his column. If he had, he would have found out Bennett had privately apologized to him. Calkins penned an apology when he realized his mistake ― but the damage was done. Bennett, who plays one of the league’s most violent positions, is one of its most gentle and caring people. The former undrafted free agent is a highly dedicated member of the community and one of the team’s most respected members. “Mike is a special person because he won’t let anyone change his opinion on what really matters,” Avril told me via text. “He will speak his mind no matter what! A lot of times athletes are afraid to voice their opinion because they want to be ‘politically correct.’ He wants to show that he’s human just like the next but won’t change who he is because he’s a professional athlete!” “I love the heck out of him,” Seahawks coach Pete Carroll told me during the season. “Terrific team player.” Bennett ― whose family foundation helps prevent childhood obesity ― has told me several times that it saddens him to see children suffering. That’s why he goes to the detention centers and why he speaks “with” the troubled youth, not “at” them, he says.  In March, the 31-year-old Bennett announced that he would donate 100 percent of his endorsements to helping minority communities and empowering women of color. Additionally, he will also donate half of his jersey sales to inner-city garden projects. “I was inspired by Chance the Rapper to ‘think bigger’ when he pledged one million dollars to Chicago kids and their school system,” Bennett said in a statement, according to ESPN. “So, I’ll be joining him by investing in the future of our youth. The system is failing our kids, and it will be up to the community and our leaders to help keep the hope alive by focusing on improving our education system and the future of our kids.” Professional athletes are under a social microscope. We expect them to make great plays and help “our teams” win games. But we also turn on them easily for things we perceive as mistakes. After Bennett supported the Seahawks’ potential signing of quarterback Colin Kaepernick, ESPN pundit Stephen A. Smith torched him for it. But Bennett didn’t remain idle. “I know by responding to you I’m just making your job easier by giving you something else to yell about tomorrow, but you are spreading so much ignorance that it’s hard to be silent,” he wrote on Instagram. “You tell us we don’t know anything, but we stand alongside people who have dedicated their lives to try and make change. We’re stepping out on our platform to make a real, substantial impact, while you play the clown.” Richard Sherman, the four-time All-Pro cornerback of the Seahawks ― and someone who is also making a great impact in the community ― believes in Bennett and his conviction, even when it’s not the popular stance. “Mike is a man of integrity,” Sherman tells me via text. “He doesn’t need to put up a front or manifest anything. He is incredibly sharp and informed. The respect that he has from his teammates and coaches stems from how hard he works and what he stands for. As a man. As a father. As a teammate. As a brother. As a friend. He gives everything he has.” Justin Tuck is a two-time Super Bowl champion, former All-Pro and like Sherman, a close friend of Bennett’s. He understands the significance of his friend’s message, even if it’s not always the most popular approach. “Recently I’ve had opportunities to see how passionate he is about change,” Tuck told HuffPost. “I think a lot of times he’s misunderstood because he’s brash in the way he goes about it. He’s also very educated and understands the impact he can have because of his platform. I think he’s utilizing it well.” “Athletes sometimes do the popular thing,” Tuck added. “Mike understands these issues.” Bennett’s honesty and conviction might scare people, but sports fans ― even those who disagree with his opinions ― should be promoting it. What matters is that Bennett doesn’t merely have an opinion, but he believes in it strongly enough to stand up for himself. “I love the city of Seattle,” Bennett told me via text. “I will continue to be an outstanding member and do it organically. But if that makes me unliked I will still do it. I want to change the game on and off the field.” Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com, ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report. ",He,speak,mind
"By Mary Beth Griggs Forecasting the weather is hard enough — just ask any meteorologist. But imagine how difficult it would be if all the data you needed to help build tomorrow’s weather map was located deep underground, utterly inaccessible, and you had to use a totally different model for each location because the rules that governed the weather in Houston, Texas were vastly different from the rules that governed the weather in Boise, Idaho. Those are just some of the challenges volcanologists face when trying to accurately predict volcanic eruptions in the same way we frequently forecast storms. But as intense as those challenges are, the widespread ubiquity of GPS technology and other remote-sensing tech has made them more surmountable today than they were decades ago. In a study published Wednesday in Frontiers in Earth Science Mary Grace Bato, a volcanology PhD student at the Institut des Sciences de la Terre (ISTerre) in France, and colleagues detailed how weather forecasting techniques can be applied to volcanic eruptions, potentially setting the stage for volcano forecasts to show up alongside weather reports in places like Alaska or Iceland. Currently, many volcanoes around the world are monitored for signs of activity (though some of these programs are set to have their funding cut). Monitoring can help cities, towns, and residents prepare for an eruption, and can save lives when monitoring stations detect that an eruption may be imminent. Evacuations by local governments ahead of the 1991 eruption of Pinatubo saved over 5,000 lives, for instance. But real-time volcano monitoring is still not nearly as robust as weather forecasting. “We can look at a volcano and monitor it,” Bato says, “But we don’t have the capability to forecast the long term or short term evolution of the volcano.” This is where GPS comes in. Satellites can now track movements in the ground, and the position of the ground over time. This is important because the vast reservoirs of magma under a volcano are nearly impossible to directly observe, and have to be monitored based on the movements they cause on the Earth’s surface. To envision a magma reservoir, Bato says you should “think of a balloon under the volcano, where the air is the magma.” As that ‘balloon’ inflates with magma rushing into the reservoir, it pushes against the overlying layers of rock and soil. “Using real GPS data, we can see the volcano is inflating,” Bato says. That’s one of the signs that an eruption might be imminent. In this new study, Bato and her colleagues showed that by combining GPS data from satellites with an existing model of how a volcano functions, and applying applying weather forecasting techniques — also called data assimilation — they could predict what situations would lead to an eruption. That’s similar to how meteorologists take real-time data and measurements from around the world and combine them with weather models to predict the track of a storm or a heat wave. While weather models are fairly robust — though there are still disagreements about which one is better — volcanology models are in much earlier stages of development, and a model that applies to a volcano in Hawaii won’t necessarily apply to a volcano in Indonesia or Russia. But Bato’s technique is flexible. “The good thing about this technique is that you can change the model that you use. You can plug it in depending on what is appropriate for the volcano you want to observe,” Bato says. All that’s required is that the model has a temporal element that takes into account how the volcano behaves over time. So far, the technique has only been applied to simulations, but Bato and colleagues are currently testing their method at Iceland’s Grimsvotn volcano, which had a noticeable eruption in 2011, and Okmok, an Alaskan volcano. Bato hopes that as volcanic eruption models become more robust, volcano forecasting might become more common, eventually helping people and communities living in the shadow of volcanoes be better prepared for the hazards they face. “It’s a long road to get there, but it’s a great beginning,” Bato says.

"It ain’t Earth, but it sure could’ve fooled us. A dramatic 360-degree panorama, released Friday by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab, shows the surface of Mars looking a lot like the southwestern U.S. The image, which was shot on Aug. 5 by the Mast Camera aboard the Curiosity rover, most notably highlights a formation known as the Murray Buttes on Mount Sharp, a peak that rises 18,000 feet over the floor of the valley in which it’s located. More than 130 individual pictures make up the stunning visual. All of them were snapped from the rover’s position during the afternoon of the mission’s 1,421st sol (Martian day), which was also the fourth anniversary of Curiosity’s landing on Mars. It’s hard to tell scale from a quick glance, but NASA says the dark mesa just left of Curiosity’s robotic arm is about 50 feet high and 300 feet from the rover’s position. You can also see an upper portion of Mount Sharp to the left of the mesa.

"Those who are familiar with New York’s Strand Book Store can likely recall its slogan: “18 miles of books.” It’s right there on the store’s ubiquitous red oval logo, seen citywide on tote bags carried by well-read locals and tourists alike. But today, the 90-year-old Manhattan institution selling new and used books boasts closer to 23 miles of the printed word. (It’s measured, by the way, by book spines, exactly how they sit on the shelf.)  “I think 18 miles has such a nice ring to it,” senior designer Topher MacDonald said, recalling an old store awning that originally read “8 miles of books.” Eventually, “somebody tacked a 1 on top of it because [the store] had gotten too big,” he added. However long the Strand’s stock is, the phrase is beautifully evocative. For a book lover catching sight of the slogan on a tote ambling around Central Park, it conjures images of never-ending stacks, more stories and curious plots than can be devoured in a lifetime.  Indeed, it’s the humble canvas tote, first sold at the Strand in the 1980s, that allows a bibliophile on-the-go to subtly transmit that image — and an image of themselves, too.  Current store co-owner Nancy Bass Wyden — the granddaughter of store founder Ben Bass — told HuffPost that the first iteration of the Strand tote was designed by a former longtime floor manager named Richard Devereaux. It had simple block letters, spelling out the store’s name, address and phone number on canvas. That design persisted until the ’90s, when the bookstore’s now-famous red oval logo replaced it. The newer design, attributed to another floor manager’s girlfriend at the time, features the bookstore’s name in Strand Gothic (the store’s own font). The initial tote was relatively small; it held only two or three books at a time. But it grew, and the designs became more varied, as the Strand began ramping up its merchandise section around 2012. “My dad [Fred Bass] kind of resisted for many years. You know, ‘What are you doing to this place?! We should just have serious books!’” Bass Wyden said. He came around to the idea, she said, because it pleased customers. “That was, and is, the most important thing to him,” she said. The Strand has now offered over 100 original tote designs, ranging from political to whimsical. Walking around the store, you can spot canvas homages to Frida Kahlo and Michelle Obama laid out on tables, or get lost in an intricate hand-drawn city scene printed on a bag. There are totes with useful additions like zippers or small phone-sized pockets. Books and tote bags go together naturally — one is an object to be carried, the other carries it. So it makes sense that Strand customers would gravitate toward the bookstore’s bags.  The appeal of a tote, however, goes beyond mere utility. On the surface, any Strand tote signals that its owner enjoys books. Perhaps the owner would also like to be seen supporting independent bookstores — an ever-more-political stance as Amazon and its ilk cast a long shadow over small businesses. Perhaps they have a connection to New York City; whether they live there, visit there, or know someone who visits there, they proudly flaunt the affiliation. Once you start looking, it’s easy to spot a Strand tote or three on an average crowded subway. Their sheer ubiquity means the bags inevitably lose a factor or two of cool. In 2011, Vol. 1 Brooklyn riffed on the associations begotten by various literary totes, suggesting the typical Strand tote owner “probably [doesn’t] actually live in New York. Either that, or you’re a freshman at NYU.” Still, for lit lovers who are unconcerned with urban cachet, there are plenty of options. Customers can buy a bag to communicate even more specific facts about themselves: I love cats. I am a feminist. Shakespeare is my personal superhero. I will not f**k someone who doesn’t own any books. “We know that people that love books, love cats,” Bass Wyden said, reiterating a likely facet of many habitual readers’ personalities: They enjoy the indoors. “We always try to keep that in mind, you know: cozy, fireplace, coffee, tea.” Hand-drawn designs — a trend seen popping up on book covers themselves ― have also proved popular, which Bass Wyden suggested was a result of the “backlash from technology” and living in an increasingly digital world.  Each tote mentions the Strand’s name in some way, usually showcasing that same red oval logo. (The Strand merchandizing team briefly tried a few other designs, replacing the “miles of books” slogan with the phrase “Where books are loved,” but ultimately went back to the original.) Nearly 50 of the designs are credited to MacDonald, who began working out on the art department floor around five years ago. His handiwork ranges from delicate, multicolor illustrations of New Yorkers going about their day to an image of an extensively detailed library with ceiling-high bookshelves and cats around each turn. MacDonald says the idea of a “weird, introvert fantasy world” inspired one of his latest designs: a dusty shelf stocked with a compass, a bell jar, a skull, books and other oddities, all presided over by a black cat. “Stay Curious,” it reads. Ultimately, the designs come out of a collaborative process, with Bass Wyden and other staff members contributing ideas to a department called Studio Strand, which also consists of designers Greg Locke and Alison George and manager Meagan Henry. MacDonald, who hand-draws designs on a tablet, said that the collaboration can lead to little visual “Easter eggs” on the totes. MacDonald included his dog in a tableau of the city’s canine population. On another bag, the Japanese character for “book” takes the place of the “A” in “Strand” — another fun wink for those in the know.  At first glance, the store’s “Victorian Reader” seems to depict a straightforward scene of old-timey New York, with older building facades, horse-drawn carriages and people in the street with their noses in books. Upon closer inspection, the attention to detail — creepy detail ― emerges. There’s a Headless Horseman statue and a violent barber inspired by Sweeney Todd. A carriage is being driven by a skeleton. Two identical twins ride eerily by on a tandem bicycle. “I think [Bass Wyden was] just like, ‘Wouldn’t it be creepy if there were some abandoned shoes in the street?’” MacDonald recalled. “It’s fun to create these opportunities for everyone. Like, what happens if you put a cobweb over here, or what happens if you put, like, a skull at the top of a building?” he continued. “Just making it as immersive as possible.” Elsewhere in the design, a frustrated writer tosses his papers out the window. In another window, Bass Wyden’s grandfather peers out at the scene below. The design has been in the merchandise rotation for several years. “It really is all of that detail that really makes it, you know, resonate for so long,” MacDonald added. With an in-house design team, the bookstore can also adapt quickly to emerging trends and new catchphrases. When “Hamilton” was selling out nightly, a “Young, Scrappy and Hungry” bag popped up on shelves. When the coloring book craze seized bookstores around 2014, Strand answered with a tote featuring outlines of New York staples: a pigeon, the MetroCard. The bookstore also offered “F**k 2016” pins and “Make America Read Again” totes: bold statements in a bold election year that allowed people to wear not just their love of reading, but their frustration, on their sleeves. “I kept saying, ‘Don’t order too much! He’s not gonna be around!’” Bass Wyden said with a laugh, referring, of course, to now-President Donald Trump. The resistance is alive, well and for sale at the bookstore, where Ruth Bader Ginsburg totes lie on a table near others that read, “Nevertheless, She Persisted.” A tote with the saying “A well-read woman is a dangerous creature” features what looks like a straightforward floral motif against black canvas, but upon further inspection, there are bees sprinkled throughout ― subtly underscoring the “dangerous creature” note. Other totes are collaborations with beloved artists like Art Spiegelman and Adrian Tomine. Other designs have come from happenstance. Bass Wyden said a manager who collected autographs and drawings asked painter David Hockney to draw him a picture when he visited the store in the ’70s. Hockney drew a bag of books, which eventually became a tote.  “I thought that was funny, to put a tote on a tote,” Bass Wyden said. For bookstore purists, the growth of the Strand’s in-store merchandise ― increasingly catering to an in-and-out kind of customer rather than one content to spend hours among the stacks ― might seem at odds with the store’s history as a haven for literature and those who love it. It’s understandable that seeing space occupied by bags advertising the store’s lengthy selection of books, instead of the books themselves, could chafe a certain kind of reader. But if a bookstore must diversify its offerings to offset changing publishing trends or to reflect customer tastes, the creations tailored for bibliophiles at the Strand seem like a practical, and charming, way to meet in the middle. In a way, the many canvas bags on offer echo the varied customers drawn to the store in order to peruse its curated tables and outdoor carts — creative, singular, true New York originals.",It,had,canvas
"Larry Nassar, the disgraced former Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics team doctor, has been accused of sexual abuse by 140 women. That’s nearly as many victims as the Jerry Sandusky, Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein scandals combined. Yet Nassar’s name is not dominating national news. It doesn’t have people protesting outside his home. It hasn’t become a punchline for every late-night television host. Days before his sentencing on Jan. 16, many of Nassar’s victims are wondering the same question: Why does no one seem to care about their story?  “I remember when the Penn State scandal was talked about at length for months and months and even years. This is nearly five times the size and no one knows about it,” sexual abuse survivor Morgan McCaul told HuffPost.  A dancer and first-year college student, McCaul is one of the dozens of plaintiffs anonymously named in lawsuits against Nassar, MSU and USA Gymnastics. The 18-year-old said that Nassar began sexually abusing her when she was just 12 years old in 2012. The abuse continued for three years. McCaul described how she’s repeatedly had to explain to professors why she needs to miss class or an exam because of an upcoming court date. Often times, she said, they have no idea about the Nassar case.  “It’s been hard to reckon with, especially because these are people that I expect to be educated,” said McCaul, who attends the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, which is only an hour away from MSU. “Even people that are teaching at universities don’t know that this went on.”  HuffPost spoke with six survivors who are suing Nassar, MSU and/or USA Gymnastics: McCaul, Alexis Alvarado, Jessica Smith, Christine Harrison, Larissa Boyce (who have all come out publicly since the lawsuits were filed) and “Jane Doe” (who wants to remain anonymous). All six women ― three gymnasts, two dancers and a soccer player ― shared a similar sentiment, that the country doesn’t seem to care what happened to them.  “I haven’t sensed the outrage,” said Boyce, who alleges that Nassar began abusing her when she was 16 and continued from 1997 to 2001. Alvarado believes the country has essentially ignored the trauma inflicted on her and the other women because they’re not famous athletes. The 19-year-old said that Nassar sexually abused her for six years starting when she was 12. “A lot of people seem to believe it’s only Olympians that this [abuse] happened to, which isn’t true,” she said.  Alvarado has a point. Although the Nassar scandal has rocked MSU and the surrounding community of East Lansing (thanks to stellar reporting from local news outlets), it seems the only times that Nassar’s name made national news were when Olympians ― including gymnasts Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney ― came forward with accusations. Other survivors believe their stories haven’t made front-page headlines because they’re female athletes. “I think it plays into the importance that we put on male athletics versus female athletics,” McCaul said. “This is a case of gymnasts and dancers and figure skaters, not football players or basketball players. I think it’s sexism, to be honest. There’s no other explanation for why this many women have come forward and it’s not big news.” Smith, who said that Nassar abused her for a few months when she was 17, also sees a connection between the identities of Nassar’s victims and the lack of public attention.  “It’s hard to feel like, if I was an Olympic gymnast, maybe this would be different. If I was a football player at MSU or a basketball player at MSU, then maybe the public and MSU as an institution would care more,” she said. Nassar, 54, sexually abused young athletes ― many of whom were top-tier gymnasts and dancers ― for decades under the guise of medical treatment. According to court documents, he gained the trust of girls and their families, which then gave him cover as he used his exams to fondle and digitally penetrate the girls in the vagina and anus. He treated many of these athletes for years during his tenures as the team doctor for USA Gymnastics, the doctor for various MSU sports teams and the sports medicine doctor at the Michigan gymnastics training gym Twistars.  The first allegation against Nassar came out publicly in September 2016, a year before the explosive rise of the #MeToo movement. He had already been let go by USA Gymnastics in 2015 and was subsequently fired from his faculty position at MSU. In December 2016, he was arrested for possessing at least 37,000 images of child pornography, and in July 2017, he pleaded guilty to three federal counts relating to child pornography. He was sentenced to 60 years in prison this December. In November, Nassar also pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct and is awaiting sentencing for those crimes. He said in a statement to the court that he’s “so horribly sorry” for what he did and he hopes the victims and the community can heal.  Nassar faces a minimum sentence of 25 years in prison for the sexual misconduct counts. The Michigan attorney general’s office has reportedly asked the judge to sentence him to 40 to 125 years. It’s safe to say that Nassar has been condemned as a sexual abuser by both the law and public opinion, and will likely die in prison. But what about the institutions that enabled his crimes to go on for so long? Many of Nassar’s victims say they told parents, coaches, MSU trainers and even police what was happening behind closed doors. Time and time again, the girls’ claims were allegedly disregarded or swept under the rug.  “I’m sick of MSU trying to look good instead of be good,” Smith said. Multiple university employees allegedly did not comply with mandatory reporting regulations when they were told about the abuse. MSU doctor Brooke Lemmen and MSU gymnastics coach Kathie Klages have both resigned in the face of mounting accusations. The dean of MSU’s College of Osteopathic Medicine, William D. Strampel, took a medical leave from his position in December. The president of USA Gymnastics, Steve Penny, resigned in March 2017 after public scrutiny of the matter. None of them, Smith and the other women who spoke to HuffPost believe, have faced sufficient punishment for their failures.  “I think that everyone that either was reported to by victims, or that had knowledge that this was going on and didn’t do anything, should have been terminated immediately, and that’s not the case,” McCaul said. “I feel like that sends a big message to victims that there are no consequences for what these people did.”  Boyce knows all too well the consequences of people in power not following mandatory reporting regulations. She said that she told Klages about Nassar’s behavior in 1997 and that the coach told her she must have misunderstood the medical procedure. At 16, Boyce was so ashamed and confused that she continued seeing Nassar for years, during which time he kept abusing her. Klages did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. “It seems like MSU, USAG, and Twistars only see us as a financial burden that needs to be silenced and squashed, devalued and discredited all while trying to say they are sorry it happened to us and are on our side,” Boyce said. “They are denying any responsibility, saying they didn’t know a predator was among them. That is like a slap in the face to the seven girls who over the past 20 years told multiple MSU employees and [they] did nothing about it. How is that not showing their complete negligence?”  The university’s response to the allegations has made an already grueling process that much more difficult, Harrison said. “It’s insulting as a victim to have to beg for answers as to why Nassar was enabled for as long as he was,” she said. “MSU did not take ownership of what they let go on. ... The enablers should be charged and a thorough investigation should be set in motion, but we have yet to see any of those actions put in motion.”  MSU has denied covering up Nassar’s behavior in any way. “Any suggestion that the university covered up Nassar’s horrific conduct is simply false,” MSU spokesperson Jason Cody told HuffPost earlier this month. “Nassar preyed on his victims, changing their lives in terrible ways. As [MSU] President Simon has said, MSU is truly sorry for the abuse all victims suffered, the pain it caused, and the pain it still causes.” MSU and Twistars filed separate motions on Friday to dismiss the lawsuits against their organizations. USA Gymnastics filed a similar motion last month, citing the statute of limitations. “Nassar’s conduct is disgusting, and USAG deplores Nassar’s crimes. But Nassar, not USAG, is liable for Nassar’s criminal actions,” USA Gymnastics attorney Andrew Portinga wrote in court documents. McCaul and dozens of other Nassar victims plan to read impact statements at his sentencing hearing, which starts on Tuesday. In McCaul’s impact statement, she grapples with her dream of becoming a doctor. “I am studying pre-medicine, and I sometimes question whether or not I still believe physicians can be good people,” she writes.  All six women who spoke to HuffPost talked about how hard it’s been to come forward with their stories. More than one described the experience as an “emotional roller coaster.” Many plan to use their impact statements to discuss the after-effects of Nassar’s abuse: depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, extreme migraines, panic attacks, stomach issues, shame, insomnia, nightmares, suicidal thoughts ― the list goes on and on.  All of them agreed, however, that they’ve found solace and comfort in one other. Harrison said she hopes the public understands that behind every Jane Doe in these lawsuits, there is a young woman working through years of trauma.  “The abuse that happened to us survivors is something that will affect us for the rest of our lives,” Harrison said. “I came forward to share my story and identity because others need to know we aren’t just Jane Does ― we are individuals with feelings.”  Now a dance teacher, Smith said that back in November she looked around at her students ― many of whom are young girls ― and realized she had to come forward with her story. The day her accusations went public, a 7-year-old student gave her a card decorated in glitter and hearts that read, “You’re my hero.”  “I just looked at her and held back tears, and she was beaming smiling,” Smith said. “She had no idea how her small gesture gave me so much assurance.” Need help?

"ORLANDO ― Noor Salman, widow of the Pulse nightclub shooter, gave her husband the “green light” to commit terrorism, a federal prosecutor told jurors on Wednesday. “None of the victims that night knew the horrific events that were about to unfold. No one knew ― except for two people,” Assistant U.S. Attorney James Mandolfo said. “Omar Mateen and his wife.”  Salman, 31, is charged with aiding and abetting her husband’s 2016 attack on Pulse nightclub in Florida and obstructing justice. She has pleaded not guilty. In the courtroom, she sat between her two defense attorneys with a blanket in her lap, occasionally taking notes and sipping water. The attack claimed the lives of 49 people, making it the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history at the time. Salman is the only one charged in the crime. Mateen died in a shootout with police after pledging allegiance to ISIS. During opening statements, attorneys for both sides painted competing portraits of the defendant. Mandolfo told jurors that Salman was aware that her husband planned to attack Pulse, and nonchalantly shopped for leather biker jackets online while he sprayed bullets into club-goers. Defense attorney Linda Moreno countered that far from being a conspirator, Salman was completely in the dark about her husband’s twisted plot, and was herself a victim of his violence. “Her only sin was that she married a monster,” she said. “She was unknowing and unaware of his plans.” Mandolfo laid out a timeline of events that he said would prove Salman not only knew about her husband’s plan but would show she encouraged and assisted him. He told jurors that Salman joined Mateen on trips to scout potential locations and to buy ammunition. The couple planned extensively for Mateen’s death, he said, by adding Salman as the death beneficiary of Mateen’s bank account and by purchasing assets, such as jewelry, which she could later sell. In an 11-day period, the couple spent around $30,000, he said. The government doesn’t have to prove that the steps Salman allegedly took to further the crime were as big as her husband’s, he added. The prosecution’s strongest piece of evidence is a statement Salman gave FBI agents in the hours following the massacre in which she said she knew about Mateen’s plans to attack Pulse. Moreno, Salman’s attorney, described Salman as “simple” and easily manipulated, and said her client was coerced into a false confession by FBI agents trained in the Reid technique, a popular method of interrogation that some say intentionally misleads suspects. Forensic evidence will prove that the claims made in the alleged confession are false, she said. She roundly rejected the government’s depiction of Salman, describing her as an apolitical, devoted mother who was abused by Mateen throughout their marriage. Salman has alleged that Mateen physically assaulted her, raped her, threatened to kill her and controlled her daily activities. “She was not his partner, she was not his peer, and she certainly was not his confidant,” she said, calling Mateen a sadist and a compulsive liar who often cheated on his wife. Salman, who has a 5-year-old son, has been incarcerated since her arrest in January 2017. She is in protective custody and spends 23 hours a day alone, family spokesperson Susan Clary said. She has not seen her son, though she is allowed to speak to him on the phone each day.   “Her son knows that his father is dead. He knows that his father was bad and killed a bunch of people. He doesn’t understand why his mother is in jail for something his father did,” Clary told HuffPost on Tuesday, standing across the street from the facility where Salman is currently being held.   Salman’s family says the version of her presented by federal prosecutors is wildly inaccurate. Her aunt, Susan Adieh, called Salman “sweet” and nonviolent, and said she is traumatized by her violent marriage to Mateen. “We know she’s no part of this,” she said. “None.”  Melissa Jeltsen will be reporting from the trial.

"Really though. My track record proves it - I have a tenancy to fall for them. Maybe it's me that's the problem, maybe it's not. Either way, that age-old adage about women flocking to bad boys and nice guys getting left in the dust? Sometimes it has a small amount of truth to it. Falling for bad boys is quick, sudden, all-encompassing. It's nothing, and then everything. It's heart over head, emotions over logic. It's a reckless abandon type of falling, one I've experienced too many times for my liking. Even so, I don't lack all common sense and intuition. There have been times that I've fallen for nice guys. But it's a different kind of falling - more precise, intentional. It involves talking myself into the relationship, reminding myself that I do deserve someone who treats me well and is genuine. It's a calculated type of falling. I've already accepted that I'm going to get a lot of flak for writing this, a lot of ""we accept the love we think we deserve""  and ""maybe it's you"" responses. But I also know I'm not alone in this situation. For a certain type of woman, there's an allure to a broody, broken, dark, mysterious man, some force that pulls us towards them even when the voice in our head is screaming that we know better, that we've been down that road before. There's something about the idea of a guy who comes off as bad, but is a softie at heart - these are the guys we convince ourselves we've come across, when really we just have a knack for picking out the assholes. Over. And over. And over. The latest asshole in my line of assholes? Arrogant. Manipulative.  Emotionally immature. Dark past. As much as I wanted to convince myself we had potential, we never stood a chance. It was always about him - he was overwhelmed, he was having a hard time, he wasn't ready. Towards the end when we did talk every few days, it was like he was doing me a huge favor by giving up his time. He never once took the time to ask how I was. Then he suddenly cut me off. I found out less than two weeks later that he was ""in a relationship"" on Facebook - after he told me we were taking things too fast and he wasn't ready for that step. At the start of said ""relationship"" with Mr. Asshole, I was talking to a friend about how I had this inexplicable gut feeling telling me to turn and run, that this was going to end badly. But, like I've done so many times before, I ignored it. It's like I have to make the mistake and see how it plays out, just in case. I was so enamored with Mr. Asshole, so determined to fix him and his problems, that I let him treat me as an option, as someone who was conveniently there when we was lonely. I knew I deserved better. Hell, he even told me as much, but I brushed it off and told him to let me decide what I deserved. The problem is that this is not a one-time thing - I continually misjudge and even justify someone's character. But why? Is there some psychological explanation? Do I just ignore red flags when they present themselves? Do I like the challenge? The anticipation? The unpredictability? What the hell does it say about me that at 22-years-old, I can look at almost every guy I have ever had a semblance of a relationship with and confidently say, ""Yep, he was an asshole, but I stuck around."" For one, it says I need to get my shit together and figure out what I deserve. There's this thing called the Douchebag Theory - no, really, it's on Urban Dictionary. Therefore it's obviously legit. It claims, ""It usually starts from a young age, when a boy is mean to a girl, the girl goes home and cries to her mom, her mom then says 'it's okay, it's just because he likes you.' The girl is then happy with that answer and moves on with life thinking every time a guy is an ass to her, it just means they like her. She goes on thinking that until she is old enough to date guys, and then she proceeds to ask the biggest douchebag out, and that explains how all the assholes get hot girls."" Okay, so that's not the most well thought out explanation - but it does make sense to a certain degree. I can certainly recall times in elementary school that this specific situation played out. I'm not claiming that is why I still tend to choose douchebags to this day, just that it could be a factor. I do have another theory for women like myself - we enjoy the chase. We revel in feeling as if we conquered or overcame something every time the douchebag lets us in a little bit more. There's something about connecting with a person who seems unattainable or unreachable. There's a little bit of victory every time they allow us a glimpse into themselves, a victory that isn't present when dating someone who has all their cards on the table from the start. And once the chase is over, we want to change the guy. Actually, scratch that. We don't want to change him, we just want him to want to change for us, to want to be a better person for us. We want to be the driving force that makes him come to their senses. It's messed up, really. Why wouldn't we want to be with someone who is a better person from the start, who we don't feel like we have to prove our worth to time and time again? I wish I had the answer, but I don't. In the meantime, I'm trying this new thing - I'm going to trust my intuition and turn the other way when it tells me to do so.",I,wish,answer
"“Waiting for Superman” (2010) was a propaganda movie promoting charter schools. I call this blog “Waiting for Evidence,” because the American public is still waiting for evidence that charter schools improve education for urban and minority youth. As you will see here, much of the evidence about the impact of charter schools is already negative. Next week public comment on the proposal to permit New York State charter schools to hire uncertified, unqualified teachers closes. Soon after that the political appointees on the State University Board of Trustees will most likely ignore public opposition and approve a teacher certification waiver for charter schools. At a time when the demand is that teachers and schools use data to evaluate students and teachers and to inform instruction, the Trustees will make their decision without collecting or evaluating evidence. The travesty is that teacher certification waiver programs are in place in other states. If the Trustees want evidence, they can study Florida, Ohio, and Michigan schools. Florida is implementing a recently passed “Schools of Hope” initiative that eliminates teacher certification requirements for charter schools. Its proponents ignore the fact that Florida has already been forced to close over 340 charter schools for poor performance. The Ohio Alternative Teacher Certification purports to raise educational standards by permitting schools to hire as teachers anyone with a bachelor’s degree with a grade point average of 2.5 or higher (C+). Michigan has a similar program that allows schools to hire unqualified, uncertified teachers. However, New York better be carefully before emulating anything tried in these three states. Under Republican pro-charter “leadership,” Florida’s national public school ranking dropped from 5th in 2011 to 29th in 2017. Ohio, 5th in 2010, dropped to 23rd in 2016. Michigan is rapidly sliding to the bottom of state education rankings on student reading scores. Its fourth graders were 28th in 2003, 41st in 2015 and are projected to fall to 48th place by 2030. In fact, instead of blindly promoting charter schools as the solution to troubled inner-city and unequal minority education, New York State needs to conduct a thorough review of charters in New York and other states. A good place to start is Detroit, Michigan, home base for Trump Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. DeVos, who was picked for her current position because she is a major Republican Party donor, is a leader in the campaign to undermine public education in Michigan, replacing public schools with charters and voucher-supported religious schools. Michigan’s “free-market,” for-profit, unregulated charter schools were supposed to improve education in the state. Michigan has the most for-profit charter schools in the United States, while hundreds of other ostensibly non-profit public charter schools are used as investment opportunities by financial gamblers. But an independent review by the Brookings Institution ranked Michigan last among all states in improving student “proficiency.” Another study, a 2016 analysis by the Education Trust-Midwest, found 70 percent of Michigan charter schools in the bottom half of the state’s school rankings. The study concluded that as a result of “charterization,” Michigan had declined from being an average performing state on math and reading tests to one of the worst, in just ten years. In the Detroit, Michigan metropolitan area we can see the devastating impact of the Trump/DeVos charter school agenda on public schools and children. A New York Times report focused on George Washington Carver Academy, a K-8 charter school located in the vest-pocket independent community of Highland Park. In 2013, the Mackinac Center, a rightwing think tank celebrated the privatization of the Highland Park school system as “unprecedented.” Despite being “charterized, Carver ranks in the bottom 20 percent of Michigan schools on the Michigan Student Test of Educational Progress (M-STEP). Since 2008, Carver has been involved in a cheating scandal when “teachers” coached fourth and fifth graders on the answers to standardized tests, and a financial scandal when the school treasurer was convicted of embezzling school funds. Its roof leaks, electronic boards are in danger of short-circuiting, the heating system is erratic, and security doors and cameras don’t work. The Times reporter concluded, “Carver probably isn’t the sort of institution where most school-choice proponents would send their own children.” Unqualified teachers in unregulated charter schools is definitely not a model for educating children in New York or any state.

"Legendary captain Derek Jeter has reportedly expressed interest in buying the Miami Marlins, a Major League Baseball team, an anonymous source told Fox Business. The former New York Yankees captain is supposedly part of a team of prospective buyers that’s up against former Florida Governor Jeb Bush to buy the franchise. Jeter expressed interest in owning a Major League Baseball team an interview last May with CNBC’s Squawk Box. “The thing that I’m interested in is making the game grow,” Jeter said. “I mean I think baseball is starting taking somewhat of a backseat to some of the other sports, and in my mind I think this is the greatest sport in the world. And I’m interested in helping the game grow.”  And the Marlins sure do need growth. The Marlins were one of the worst teams in the league at one point, but they have been doing better in recent years. Recruitment of rookies such as Giancarlo Stanton has pushed the team back into the spotlight after the team’s 2003 World Series win. The team rebranded from the Florida Marlins to the Miami Marlins in 2012. They also moved into a new stadium. According to Forbes’ team evaluation, the Marlins are worth an estimated $675 million after factoring in operation cost and payroll.  Jeter left baseball in 2014 after nearly 20 years in with the Yankees. Shortly after his retirement he announced the launch of The Players’ Tribune, a website dedicated to giving athletes a platform to express themselves.  “So I’m in the process of building a place where athletes have the tools they need to share what they really think and feel,” he said on a post on the site. “We want to have a way to connect directly with our fans, with no filter.” The 42-year-old retiree is also working on an anti-bullying campaign as well as his Turn 2 Foundation, a program to keep children away from drugs and alcohol. The former shortstop is about to embark on fatherhood with his wife, Hannah. ",they,were,years
"On Friday, April 6, The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, sat down with the magazine’s star national correspondent, Ta-Nehisi Coates, for a live question-and-answer session in front of the company’s staff. This was a scheduled event, part of the media company’s in-house “Atlantic University” series, but the off-the-record conversation took on a new urgency because of what had happened the previous day. On Thursday, April 5, the magazine had announced that it was cutting ties with Kevin Williamson, the irascible conservative writer it had installed in the magazine’s “Ideas” section only two weeks earlier. The impetus for his departure was the revelation that Williamson actually believed the things he had said in the past — namely his 2014 comments that women who have abortions should be hanged. This had led Goldberg to conclude that The Atlantic, recently purchased by Laurene Powell Jobs’ liberally minded Emerson Collective, was “not the best fit for his talents.” What the centrist magazine might’ve once considered nothing worse than a cheeky heterodoxy from its right flank was now, Goldberg had discovered, suddenly and unacceptably outside the mainstream. The Atlantic, whose motto is “of no party or clique,” had found itself in an awkward spot. In the weeks since, we’ve heard Williamson’s version of events. Preaching the story of his martyrdom in media outlet after media outlet after media outlet, the columnist has portrayed himself and even Goldberg, too, as the victims of a “Twitter mob,” forced to suffer the tyranny of our “P.C. culture.” Apparently, Goldberg had severely misjudged what Williamson’s hiring would mean to a larger audience. In The Wall Street Journal, Williamson recounts a conversation he’d had with Goldberg shortly after he’d been hired: “You know, the campaign to have me fired will begin 11 seconds after you announce that you’ve hired me,” I told him. He scoffed. “It won’t be that bad,” he said. “The Atlantic isn’t the New York Times. It isn’t high church for liberals.” Beyond his initial statement, Goldberg has said nothing publicly about the episode. But in his Atlantic University appearance with Coates, he tried to explain his thinking to his staff. Characterizing the meeting, an Atlantic spokesperson wrote in an email to HuffPost: “Jeff hosts regular meetings on issues large and small with staff. The meeting with Jeff and Ta-Nehisi had been scheduled for some time and just so happened to have fallen the day after the Williamson episode, which provided an opportunity for staff to speak openly and ask questions and for Jeff to respond frankly and transparently.” HuffPost viewed a video of the session; a full transcript can be found below. It’s a remarkable exchange. Coates, who has spoken admiringly of Williamson’s prose style if not his politics, is frank and searching and self-critical where Goldberg is glib and simpering, apparently unaware of just how much and why the ground had shifted beneath his magazine’s feet. The conversation centers on Williamson and the decision not to keep him around. But it winds up being about more than that. Coates talks about having learned, as a young journalist, from writers who thought of black men like him as less than human. What choice did he have? These were the journalists who got bylines in prominent magazines, and even at liberal publications, the genetic inferiority of black people was a proposition considered worthy of debate. “I didn’t really have the luxury of having teachers who I necessarily felt, you know, saw me completely as a human being,” Coates says. The question of diversity in media alone is fraught territory. In 2016, a group of employees returning from the 2016 National Association of Black Journalists conference sent a letter to Goldberg expressing concerns with the magazine’s monochromatism, according to multiple people who were on staff at the time. By all accounts, Goldberg has since taken steps to address the criticism. Since Goldberg became editor-in-chief in October 2016, The Atlantic had added 34 full-time journalists to the newsroom, of which 25 have been women and 11 have been people of color, according to a spokesperson. But Coates wasn’t making a point about diversity or, for that matter, about the pedagogical possibilities of broadmindedness. He was talking about the protective layer of cynicism he had to develop against certain kinds of political ideas. Coates had no expectations of Williamson beyond some flowery prose. No expectations, he says to his colleagues, of Williamson “seeing me or, frankly, a lot of you as fully realized human beings.” This was the idea being circled in the conversation between Coates and Goldberg and their colleagues at The Atlantic. Over and over, the humanity of certain people is allowed to be put up for debate in the name of “ideological diversity.” How can a liberal institution square its essential humanism with an ideal of inclusion so baggy as to promote the sort of cruelties that liberals, at least outwardly, mean to oppose? The similarly oriented New York Times op-ed page, run by former Atlantic editor James Bennet, is wrestling with this very question. On the basis of his conversation with Coates and the magazine’s staff, Goldberg doesn’t seem any closer to answering it than is the Times or any other creature of centrist liberalism. At least The Atlantic has company. You might call it a clique. The conversation has been lightly edited for grammar and continuity. And if you’re a current or former Atlantic employee, please feel free to get in touch. Jeffrey Goldberg: I said this in the meeting this morning, the dot-com meeting. You know, we do these things because we’re a cohesive unit, and we all work together. And it’s great when we get to talk openly about complicated issues, but we can’t do it if people are feeding information to people outside about what we’re talking about. And so, I recognize the desire to share things, but it would be better if we didn’t. We’ll call this off the record for whatever that means in today’s age, but it would be better if we could just have an honest conversation. Ta-Nehisi Coates: So the genesis of me as a journalist is like, mid-’90s — I got my first writing job in ’96 — and a big ideas magazine at the time was The New Republic. No black people worked there. I’ve actually verified this. No black people worked there at all. And to my mind — other people will probably feel quite differently about this — but as far as I was concerned, it was basically a racist publication. And that was how I perceived it. But nevertheless, I had to read it. I had to read it because I wanted to do what they did. And there weren’t — and I don’t know how to put this without sounding like an asshole — but there was no me to learn from. In other words, there was no “Case for Reparations” for me to read and say, goddamn, I want to go do that. I mean, maybe there was some of that, but it really was not in the ethos. There were certainly black writers who would be brought in. They would come into places like the New Republic, New Yorker and sometimes even The Atlantic, and they would give a view of black life that I felt like very few black people actually would recognize themselves in their own private spaces. I got, I think, incredibly used to — and I don’t know if it’s a good thing or a bad thing, I guess for a long time I probably thought it was a good thing, but this week it made me think I don’t know whether it is or not — but I got incredibly used to learning from people. And studying people. And feeling like certain people were even actually quite good at their craft, who I felt, and pardon my language, were fucking racist. And that was just the way the world was. I didn’t really have the luxury of having teachers who I necessarily felt, you know, saw me completely as a human being. This extends not just from my early days as a journalist, but if I’m being honest here, from my early days at The Atlantic. You can go into The Atlantic archives right now, and you can see me arguing with Andrew Sullivan about whether black people are genetically disposed to be dumber than white people. I actually had to take this seriously, you understand? I couldn’t speak in a certain way to Andrew. I couldn’t speak to Andrew on the blog the way I would speak to my wife about what Andrew said on the blog in the morning when it was just us. Goldberg: I found, personally, that yelling at him in the office was very emotionally satisfying for me. But you didn’t do that. Coates: I didn’t do that. And part of it was, going back to that earlier thread, I learned how to blog from Andrew. That was who I actually learned from. That was who actually helped me craft my voice. Even recognizing who he was and what he was, you know, I learned from him. I think one of the things that happens is you become incredibly cynical about certain people and about certain political beliefs, and you just don’t hold them to a level. So I can read Kevin Williamson, for instance, and I guess — and I probably would not have said this like this two weeks ago — but just watching, and thinking, and not really having expectations. Like, having craft expectations — like reading him and saying, how can I learn from this as a writer. But not really having actual expectations of seeing me or, frankly, a lot of you as fully realized human beings. And everybody here knows my politics. I know what The Atlantic is supposed to be, but I’m not speaking for them, I’m just speaking for myself. I think — and I think I’ve actually argued this in The Atlantic — that that is not just a personal flaw of Kevin Williamson. That is a part of the movement that he’s a part of. It represents a large swath of this country. And I think the problem for us, or the essential conflict for us, is that we set ourselves up with I think a pretty admirable value that says, OK, we are going to debate different poles of politics in this country. And we want that well-represented, and we want people that can do it effectively, write well. But if one pole is — and again, I’m only speaking for myself here — if one pole is batshit crazy, you’re in trouble. It actually throws the whole endeavor out of whack. The thing that ultimately made this not go was Kevin’s really callous podcast, where he says, I have a soft spot for hanging. He’s talking about literally hanging women. And now, we’re in a room obviously with a large number of women. The question of abortion is not theoretical to them. It’s not an abstract question. You know, again, not making any assumptions but just knowing the statistics, it’s probably a very direct question to some women in this room. So when Kevin says that he’s talking about them. And that’s bad, but when I thought about it, if you believe abortion is murder, and you believe in capital punishment, what’s the logical conclusion? Is this Kevin himself or is this a broader question? In other words, did Kevin state a specific belief that is outside of the mainstream conservative movement, or did he just follow those conclusions to their natural place? And if he did, you have a much broader problem, I think, in terms of this whole question of actual debate. You know, I’ve thought quite a bit — and you can interrupt whenever you want. Sorry, obviously I’ve been thinking about this, and I don’t have nobody to talk to because I’m off Twitter. Goldberg: Wait, wait, wait, you should be fully honest. His new version of Twitter is — he’s one of those people who text messages every individual thought individually. It’s like ping, ping — so I’m your new fucking Twitter. [laughter] Goldberg: Twelve, 15 texts in a row that you could have made one paragraph. Coates: I’m sorry — Goldberg: That’s where it comes from. I just realized! So he has been actually tweeting, but just at me. Coates: It’s true, it’s true. Among other people. But you know, I was an admirer of Kevin’s work, and I think I can say this, you know, Jeff talked to me about this. And I was not like, don’t hire that dude. To the contrary, I thought, OK, well he can come in and represent the position, and then we can fight it out. You know what I mean? So I think I should say, A) I feel like I failed Jeff in that advice. I feel like I kind of failed The Atlantic in that advice. I feel like I failed the writers of color here in that advice. I was here when I was the only black writer, and then Gillian came, and then we got a bunch more people. So I feel like I kind of failed you guys in that. I’m sorry about that. I’m sorry so many of y’all are on social media and catching shit for this, and I’m not there, so I’m not catching anything at all. I feel really, really bad about that. But then after, realizing that, I thought about, OK, so how did I muck this up? Goldberg: I want to issue an absolution here. Coates: I don’t need it, though. I don’t need it. Goldberg: No, no, but I’m going to give it anyway. But go on. Coates: So I thought about it, like, you know how did I miss that? I’m Mr. Blackity Black, how did I miss that? And I think one of the things that happened is, again, like understanding the mission of The Atlantic, which I get. It might not be my mission, but I get it, and I work here. I understand it. Debate various views, you know, we fight it out. “Of no party or clique,” right? And I told Jeff this already, but we have been of a party and a clique. The Atlantic, like most magazines — not The Atlantic because it’s specifically bad, but for most of its history it has been basically white dudes. That’s what we’ve been. I mean not totally, not completely. We did publish Frederick Douglass and Martin Luther King. And I mean, it’s not that that’s all we published, but that’s basically been what one would say the consensus is. When you have an already established consensus like that, certain values are then easily manifested. I think one of the things that happened at this magazine now that I’ve championed, I’m happy to see just looking at this room. If we had done Atlantic University in 2008, 2009, ’10, ’11, ’12, ’13, it would not have looked like this. This publication is diversifying. And I wonder if that consensus that says of no party or clique then has to come up for question. What is debatable comes up for question because you bring different people in, and those people are not just brown-skinned or dark-skinned or women who would normally — you know, who are just the same as any other. Their identity — and I know this is bad in certain quarters, but I don’t think it is — that identity cannot be neatly separated from the job. So maybe the job changes a little bit. Goldberg: So let me just say two things on that. First is, in all seriousness, the decisions are on me. They’re not on you or anyone else who met Kevin beforehand. The decisions are on me. And you know, I appreciate your advice, and I always appreciate your advice. But it’s not you. The second part is, and I am torn on this, part of trying so hard to diversify gender, race, ethnicity, orientation, whatever, part of it is to make sure that we’re of no party or clique. Right? I mean, I’ve told — you know this, we’ve talked about it — I’ve told senior editors I never want to walk into a meeting at The Atlantic where decisions are being made and not have a diverse room and not have black people and brown people and women and whatever. And part of that is very specifically a New Republic thing, if you’ll recall, because when they published — this is going back 20 years — but when they published an excerpt of The Bell Curve, the decision to publish that was made in a room with only white people. So what I’m saying is that my goal of never walking into a room where decisions are being made and seeing only white people, white males, is partially because that’s the right thing, and it’s partially self-protection. Because I think if there had been a black editor in that room in the New Republic in 1996 or whatever, that black editor might have said: “Excuse me. So I just want to clarify something. We’re putting a cover story up that says black people are stupider than white people?” That could have happened, and then they would have saved themselves an awful lot of grief; and they wouldn’t have injected something that, in my own personal opinion, is poison into the discourse. On the other hand, why can’t a journalism institution that is diversifying — I hope people understand — fairly rapidly in terms of gender, ethnicity, race, why can’t it also continue to develop in an ideologically diverse way? And maybe there’s some questions that are no longer on the table because of that, but there’s got to be a whole bunch of questions that we could still disagree about without touching the third rails of gender and abortion and race and all these other things. I mean, what are you saying? That we do have to become what a lot of the world wants us to be, which is a stay-in-you-lane, center-left publication? Coates: No, I think the deal is that in the ’90s, when this room would not have looked like this room does, there were things that were considered out of bounds. I don’t think we would have published “The Case for Reparations” then. If you change the makeup of the room, other things probably would become inbounds, and some things then become out of bounds. And I think the problem is, some of those things — this is the huge, huge problem — some of those things that I would argue should be out of bounds, actually a large number of Americans actually believe. Things that would be out of bounds for us are not necessarily out of bounds for the broader country. Goldberg: Or big parts of the country. Coates: No, huge parts, huge parts. I mean we got data on this during the Republican primary, right? They took data, 30, 40 percent of Americans agree with this sentiment. I’m sorry, not of Americans, of Republican voters. I should be clear about that. But you know, a huge swath of Americans, like 30 or 40 percent [of Republican voters] believe that black people are not as smart as white people. Or believe black people are somehow more criminally inclined. That’s a lot of people. That’s a lot of people. And obviously that’s out of bounds for us. Goldberg: No, we’re never running shit like that, obviously. Coates: So to some extent the debate is already curtailed. There are views that are very popular in America that we will not deal with. Goldberg: That’s the funny thing, because, you know, somebody asked me the other day, what won’t we run? And I could probably reel off 200 ideas that we would never post. You know, genetic-inferiority issues. Coates: And that’s an ongoing debate in respectable publications right now. Goldberg: No, if somebody came in and said George Soros and the Rothschilds are destroying Eastern Europe because of Jewish cosmopolitanism and controlling D.C.’s weather, we ain’t going to — you know, we’re not doing that. And by the way this has been what makes the conversation so meta. What I learned myself Thursday is — and this is the interesting question, because it’s about past opinion. Opinion that wouldn’t even necessarily get expressed obviously in The Atlantic. But like, if you actually sincerely, seriously argue with a level of callousness that women who have abortions not only should be prosecuted criminally — which puts you on the right end of the right-to-life spectrum anyway — but that hanging is a possibility, we need to be serious about that and say we’re not taking a piece that says that, right? So there’s 100 things, 200 things that we just wouldn’t ever publish, but I would just encourage you to, instead of thinking about a narrowing, think about all the things that we still can do. Like, there’s a lot more. Coates: No, I’m not thinking about a narrowing. I think we can actually do a lot more. I just think it’s like, again, if your consensus is there, it’s here now. The number of things that you can do is not actually changed. Goldberg: Could we have a debate in The Atlantic on abortion rights? Can you have an anti-abortion person — in your mind, obviously? Coates: I mean, you could. Goldberg: No, I’m saying, as The Atlantic, is that out of bounds now? What’s out of bounds? Coates: I mean, this is me talking, but I just don’t think Kevin was out of the mainstream in terms of those views. So if you do that, I don’t understand the logic of getting rid — he said it in a really rude ... Again, I just got to go through this one more time. In the platform of the Republican Party: death penalty. In the platform of the Republican Party: pro-life. The belief that abortion is murder is not a fringe view. Defense of capital punishment is not a fringe view. If somebody participates in baby killing, and you advocate for the death penalty for them, I don’t understand that as a particularly— it’s said in a kind of way that people don’t usually say it. But the logical inference of it, like, how does the logic exist out of some sort of mainstream consensus? I’m not seeing that. And so, if we have that debate, and then we have a bunch of people who are kind of talking around a very uncomfortable fact of the belief that Kevin raised, I guess I would be like, why don’t we just have Kevin do that? Kevin was honest, at least. Kevin spoke about the actual logical outcomes. I just want to be clear, I don’t agree with that. I think it’s completely batshit crazy, but at least it’s consistent. He took it to its logical ends, which I think a lot of people are afraid to do. Now, there are some people, like Ross [Douthat] at the Times, who actually are anti-death penalty and, you know, pro-life, so the logic would not work [inaudible]. Goldberg: No, but do the conversation that we did a couple days ago about spirit of generosity. It’s this mantra that we repeat all the time, and I think people internalize it. But talk about that in the frame of this conversation. I mean, what does it mean to you? What does it mean to you in the conversation we’re having about a particular way of expressing yourself? Coates: I mean I have particular views, man, and I’m uncomfortable with the idea that The Atlantic should necessarily adopt my views. Goldberg: Well, no, The Atlantic is not going to adopt your views. Coates: No, but I don’t want to even — I just ... Goldberg: These are smart people. They can handle your views. Coates: I mean, I don’t think it’s particularly generous to say that you or the state should have authority over a kind of labor that only 50 percent of most people — or slightly more in this country — actually do. I don’t think that’s generous. I don’t think that’s generous at all. I don’t think it’s generous to believe that some 16-year-old girl somewhere, you know, who — no, we’re not even going to do some 16-year-old girl. Let’s do this a lot more direct. My son — I love my son, I love him to death. And this is like the other part of Kevin’s story, which I heard and I understand and I get it. But my wife had gestational diabetes, swelled up like 80 pounds while she was pregnant with my son, [and she] almost died in our apartment when I was 24 years old. And the notion that she should not have control over a process that almost killed her, I don’t think is generous. I just don’t — the belief, not how Kevin said it. Now, I wish he would state that more politely. But no, I actually don’t think the belief is generous. And you know, again, that’s my belief. I’m not saying The Atlantic got to adopt it, but, no, I don’t think it’s generous at all. And I’ve got to say, let me back up, too, because I don’t want to get too righteous. In my advice to you, I was thinking about the debate part, and I forgot about the generosity part. Goldberg: Oh, when we were talking? Coates: When we were talking I completely forgot about it. Because I would have raised — I would have said this shit is quite obviously not generous, you know. But of course, then, I would have gone to the larger debate and said, well, is it the belief, or is it how I actually feel about this? You know, I think a lot, from my end, a lot of this comes from just a general — there’s no other way to say this — a lack of respect for certain views. So then you don’t really actually think about the implications in the same sort of way. You’ve already written people off. Goldberg: I mean, actually, you’ve done a very interesting thing here, which is, you’ve encapsulated the tension of being The Atlantic in a kind of way. Which is wanting to be the most robust center for debate in America but also trying to be generous of spirit and have a sort of a merciful attitude toward people who don’t have — Coates: And I wonder if those two things are, at this moment, if you will ... I actually think there is — and I think you’re in a much better position, honestly — but I think that this is happening here, and what’s happening with Bennet at the Times right now. I just don’t think it’s a mistake. I don’t think it’s a mistake. Goldberg: Wait, what’s not a mistake? Coates: Well, I don’t think it’s a mistake that, you know, we’re having these really, really hard debates about what views get access to what. And crazily enough, and I know — I think I can say this among us — just from talking to James, he’s tried do a very similar thing to what you’ve done here. He would love to diversify the paper, have more voices, and I know he wants that. And I think, like you also, he wants a broad range of debate. Like, those two things actually, as you said, they’re part of each other. And I guess what I’m suggesting is they actually might also be in conflict with each other. Goldberg: Look, I mentioned this this morning in a meeting just for the web team. I think the founding manifesto of The Atlantic is in tension with itself. Because I mean, the founders had this tension 161 years ago. They were all abolitionists. They’re not hosting the debate. Coates: Which, by the way, was not a mainstream view at the time. Goldberg: In Boston, it was a mainstream view, where they were making a magazine. But they were not going to — there was no thought that they were going to host a debate about abolition or about the rightness or wrongness of slavery. They had a position. They also said that we want to be a marketplace for a discussion of the American idea, which means that you have to have an argument. So I think what we’re going around and saying, sort of, a little bit, is that — the old line is, you know when you’re in a minefield when you hear a loud explosion under your feet. Right? Nobody knows where are the lines. We don’t really know where the lines are, but I guess my question to you — and this is a generational question — I think one of the reasons we are on more of a same page than not on the Kevin Williamson question is that we’re of a certain generation, like you talked about, where our journalism institutions — there was a lot of fighting. There was just a lot of fighting and arguing. I mean people who were here eight years, 10 years ago. Coates: Yeah, it was constrained fighting, though. Actually, I’m not sure — Goldberg: It wasn’t that constrained here eight, 10 years ago. I mean, when we were all bloggers. Me, you, Ross, Andrew. Coates: Yeah, but I would argue that it was constrained even then because I was the only — I think I can even make this broader — I know I was the only black writer. I think I was the only writer of color. And there was only one other woman, and that was Megan. So I would say it was even constrained then. And now, that’s not the case. So it is actually, I think, more difficult. And I mean that in a good way. Like, not more difficult in that we should go back to the old way, but I think it was constrained. I think it’s much easier to draw a consensus when you’re pulling from the same demographic. And I don’t mean consensus, like you all don’t argue, but you can say, OK, the line is here, the line is here, let’s fight it out. That’s easier when everywhere — let’s make it even deeper. I mean, at that time, me, you, Ross, Megan McArdle, Jim, Matt Yglesias, Andrew — I think every single one of those people, with the exception of me, went to an Ivy League school. I mean, in many ways, people are coming from a very, very similar place. You know, that’s not what this is now. Goldberg: Do you think The Atlantic would be diminished if we narrowed the bounds of acceptability in ideological discourse, even as we grow in diversity? Coates: Again, I don’t think it’s a question of narrowing. I think it’s where the lines are drawn. Goldberg: Well, it is if you bring the lines in. Coates: Well, no, you open it up. You understand what I’m saying? Like, as I said before, I don’t think 15 years ago or 20 years ago we would have ran “The Case For Reparations.” So that means it’s opened up in a different direction. I think if we publish kick-ass stories, very little of this will actually matter. Goldberg: Go on about that. Talk about reporting. [laughter] Goldberg: I mean, I don’t care. I mean people just, I mean, we talk about this. People ask me, you know, how does this controversy affect you. And I’m like, I have leather skin, so whatever. I mean, I’m sorry for people who are getting attacked on Twitter because they happen to be affiliated with The Atlantic. I’m insensitive to it after 30 years of this. But I mean, this will last until it doesn’t, until it goes away. But the question is the reporting thing. I’m very interested in that, reporting vs. opinion. Some people have written me and said, you know what, opinion generally is overrated, don’t do opinion, do reporting. I mean, you have thoughts on that I want you to share with everybody. Coates: You know, when I came they weren’t in conflict. I think reported opinion are better than unreported opinions. Goldberg: Well yeah, pure opinion is — is not the greatest thing. Coates: Yeah, you shouldn’t do too much of that. You should stretch yourself. Because I think it’s always good, even as I’m saying what I’m saying, I do think it’s always good to come in contact with real people who may not share your assumptions and where you’re coming from. It doesn’t mean that they’re going to convince you. But they broaden you, they deepen you, you know, give you some perspective on things that you just may not have seen before. So I actually think that’s probably the core value. Goldberg: The core value of The Atlantic? Coates: Yeah, man. Well I don’t know if it’s been the core value, but I think that’s the one that matters. If you publish kick-ass stories, nobody’s going to care. Nobody’s beating down The New Yorker saying, where is you Kevin Williamson or where are your conservative writers. Like, it’s amazing how they don’t get that at all. Goldberg: Well, they’re a different product, though. They’re an entirely different product. Coates: No, that’s true. It’s true. But you know, the stories they publish obviously occupy a lot of real estate and have a kind of impact. Goldberg: Yeah, but they would never publish ” The Case For Reparations,” which is reported argument. Coates: I don’t think they would either. They say they would, though. [laughter]. Goldberg: Yeah, NOW. Coates: Now they do, now they do. Goldberg: Easy to say it now! No, I told you, they’d run it as a 6,000-word story: “The Lonely Struggle of John Conyers.” Coates:They would, they would. But by just taking that on, I go back to where I started. I don’t know that we were “of no party or clique.” I know we said that, but I would question whether that was actually the case. Goldberg: Is that something to strive for even if we never reach it. Your own opinion. Coates: I just feel like if we publish really, really great journalism, like ... I know that sounds simplistic, and maybe it is simplistic. Maybe I’m being flip. Goldberg: Let me ask you one final question before, and we’ll take questions. Coates: You know, my thinking about this now, like where I’m at now. You know what I would like to do? I would like to get a stack of Kevin Williamson’s articles and compare them to what the standard is here at The Atlantic. I wonder if they measure up. Goldberg: That’s an interesting question. It’s not entirely relevant because we don’t hire — you know, I mean this is one of the arguments … Coates: No, I know, that people get better when they come here. I get it, yes, yes. Goldberg: If we’re not making them all better then we’re not fulfilling the mission. But one more thing on this before we go to questions. I want to understand, as a journalist, put aside the other extraneous things that are going on around here, as a journalist, what attracted you to Kevin Williamson? You said on a podcast — Coates: I think he’s a beautiful — I love people that, you know, I don’t like people who fuck around. I don’t like people who sort of do that duck and dodge, and he writes with a kind of aggression you know that I actually seek to write with myself. When I wrote “The Case for Reparations,” he wrote a reply. And I was so happy that he did. There was, like, no other conservative person I would have answered at all. You know, I was happy to be in debate with him. I, again, I’m from a place where I can take my lessons from people and not agree with a damn thing they’re saying. You know, that’s just me. You know, reporting is one thing; that’s important. But the writing is actually really, really important for me. And I thought, when he was on, he’s really, really good actually. Like, the writing is really, really good. I don’t take that back, although I do want to kind of have that thought experiment again. But that was at least my impression at the time. That when he was on, he was pretty damn good. And I don’t think I was actually alone in feeling that. And I don’t just mean you. I mean outsiders, but I think there were other people who felt that way who were not necessarily crazy. That don’t mean this was the right decision, or the right thing or the wrong thing happened — that’s not what I’m saying. But I don’t think I was alone in admiration with his craft. And I guess — you know what I learned from this? You know, when I went out and said, I think he’s a kick-ass writer. I don’t [inaudible], but I think he’s a kick-ass writer. Like, I actually can’t say things like that anymore. Even if it’s what I think because, you know, and I’m just coming back to this again. But what became clear to me was that other people get drawn in because I’m part of The Atlantic. That’s been really hard to see, you know. I say that, and probably if I was on Twitter, he would be in my mentions calling me to account. But I’m not there, right? So you see other people who ain’t said nothing at all. Who ain’t done nothing but just try to do their job. Who ain’t had nothing to do with this. You know, getting called on stuff. And that’s just hard to see. That’s very, very hard to watch. Goldberg: Why don’t we take some questions here. Staffer: Kevin conjured a really powerful image when he used the word “hanging.” I think that was an image that was really hard for a lot of us to ignore. And I’m wondering how or if you think this would have played out differently if he hadn’t used that word. Coates: Great question. Staffer: Or if he had just said death penalty or even lethal injection. How much of it was “hanging?” Coates: I’m not sure we’d be here right now. I’m not sure we’d be here. I think it’s the specificity, you know, which is akin to how he writes. I mean, I think that’s exactly right. And I think that points to the tension of it. Was he just too clear? Was it really his viewpoint? Was it actually his viewpoint? Or was it just that he said it in a kind of way? Goldberg: You know, the weakness of writers is they want to be interesting. Coates: Yeah, but it’s not even interesting. Goldberg: No, but it’s vivid, you know. You’re always trying to be vivid and provocative, and it goes to that question of line. Like, you know the line only when it’s been crossed, right? And everybody feels collectively, oh, that’s the line. Coates: But I think the point here is, it’s your job to be vivid. It’s your job to use — I do that all the time! You know, you’re trying to actually use vivid language, all of us. And so it’s like, did he just write about this with more clarity? And certainly, there’s an asshole-ish, troll-ish portion to that that should not be ignored. And — and this will probably come up, I’m not trying to step on anybody — but, honestly, the piece about hanging is just the tip of it. There are other things he said and wrote that I think act, you know, similarly. Goldberg: Emma has a question. Emma Green: I was struck by what you said about the old times at The Atlantic, and I definitely agree with you that The Atlantic we are now is much preferable to — Coates: Emma when did you come? Green: 2012. Coates: So you saw a little bit of this. Green: Yeah, we had the little heads on the side of the web site, all the white dudes. Coates: Right. Green: So I definitely agree that we are a better place. We do more interesting work I think than when I first got here, but I think I’ve heard you talk about this — I’ve definitely heard Conor talk about this. I think I’ve even heard Jim talk about this, I don’t want to speak for you guys — but a certain amount of nostalgia for that time, which was the ability to just get out there and punch each other and people debating and actually having genuinely different ideas and having that spirit of really wanting to engage. And we just don’t have that anywhere on our website. So I wonder if you think this Kevin Williamson affair represents the impossibility of getting back to any version of that, or if there is some version of that that we could get back and how. Coates: Yeah, I think there is. I think it’s just, where are the lines going to be? I mean, it’s not like among my friends, who are closer to me ideologically, there are no debates to be had. Are we — and you guys would know this better than me so correct me if I’m wrong — did we really well represent, for instance, the debate between the Sanders wing of the Democratic Party and the Clinton — you know, I’m being really crude in my statements — and the Clinton wing of the Democratic Party? Have we done a good job representing that? Do we have folks that can write aggressively and write really well to represent that [inaudible]? I mean, that’s an actual debate. It’s a vivid, real debate — and we could have that! There’s no reason why we couldn’t have that right now. And I don’t think that’s — I think it’s better than me having to debate Andrew about genes and IQ. I think that’s much, much more substantial and would be an improvement. So I think we can get back to it. Green: It’s possible that we have people here who could do Sanders-Clinton if they were encouraged to do that. But do we have anybody who could do Ben Sasse-Rubio-Trump-Ted Cruz? I mean, do we have anybody who could do that? Not really, right? Maybe Conor. Coates: No, that’s true. But again, that just takes me back to the question that was asked over here. Like, is what Kevin Williamson ... this is why it was such a provocative challenge for us, as far as I’m concerned. How far out of the wheelhouse of Rubio and Ben Sasse is Kevin Williamson? Or did he just say it in a certain type of way? So for me, it takes us back to, OK, so why was he fired again? Or not hired; I guess he wasn’t fired. But why is he not here again? You know? Goldberg: Gillian, why don’t you go on in here? Gillian White: So I guess my question is, when we talk about the representation of some of the ideas and beliefs that Williamson held, I think a lot of us are of the mind that it is fine and appropriate and necessary to have somebody arguing those things on The Atlantic’s platform. I think the issue comes with whether or not it’s a civil discourse. And that is the thing that I think a lot of people feel when they talk about “spirit of generosity.” I think there are a lot of Americans and a lot of writers and a lot of people who could articulate a pro-life stance — and a lot of these other stances — who maybe have not been described in the same way as Williamson has. I mean, you just called him a troll. He’s been described as pugnacious. Do we not think that there’s a space between civil discourse and people who are being described as right-wing trolls and pugnacious and all those other things? Do we not think that there’s someplace that exists where people can represent those opinions in a civil discourse on this platform? Goldberg: Can I say something quick on that? I actually think — and I hope I’m not embarrassing him by saying this, and I don’t even know if he’s watching this — but I think we have on our team one of the best practitioners of exactly what you’re talking about, Conor Friedersdorf, who should be a model for everyone. What Conor does is — I mean, we talked about this this morning, I’m sorry for those of you who are hearing this again — what Connor does is, he has an argument he wants to make. He takes the opposition’s argument, characterizes it fairly, gives it its full due, and then systematically but civilly dismantles it to the best of his ability. Right? And that’s the most Atlantic-ish thing there is. So, you know, I think it’s completely possible to do that and not touch the third rail of outrageous language, or crazy over-the-line talk. I mean, we have a lot of other people who do that as well. I’m using Conor, in part, because, if we’re being honest here, Conor is outside the political mainstream, I would think, of this room but a valued and hugely important member of this family Coates: But Conor is also not within the mainstream of conservative thought, either. Goldberg: No, but… Well, Conor is very heterodoxical, so he does all kinds of things, but — Coates: So there’s certainly room for that. I would definitely agree with that. But I think the bigger challenge is, and I think this is what Gillian was pointing to, could you articulate those ideas and — again, I just drive back to, then what did he actually do wrong? Is it what he said? Is it how he said it? You know, I’m skeptical, man. And I think part of this is the ground. I think it’s the change with the makeup of The Atlantic. I think it’s Trump. I think the ground has actually shifted. You know, should we build the wall is a mainstream debate. These ideas have now been mainstreamed. And so, is it our job, then, to represent things that, you know, that I think are absolutely batshit crazy just because they’re within the consensus? Again, where is the line? I don’t know, man. I have a hard time with the Williamson thing because what offends me is not how he said it. Like, I get why that was a problem for The Atlantic and the look. Like, there’s a PR argument for that. But when I start breaking down those beliefs, I’m like, but is he outside of the mainstream of conservative thought? You’re talking about a party that only a couple years ago — and I don’t know where these numbers are now — but only a couple of years ago, a majority of people believed that the president of the United States was born in Kenya. I mean, that’s a profound challenge to an organ that says it wants to have a robust debate between the poles of this country. Goldberg: So should we be part of the resistance? Coates: No, because we’re journalists. No. I’m not part of no resistance. I’m not an activist at all. You know, as I made the mistake and publicly said, you know I criticized Bernie Sanders and voted for him, both. The same thing — I shouldn’t have said that. I shouldn’t have said who I voted for. But no, I mean, but that’s the difference. I don’t have to write things that endorse the people — you know, I generally was a fan of Obama. But I criticized him all the time here because I’m a journalist. You understand? Like, no. I’m not part of any resistance. At all. Goldberg: Not you. What about us? Coates: No, no. Absolutely not. Absolutely not. For instance, a story I would love to see — no, I’m not gonna say it. I might be taking somebody’s story, sorry. Because I’ve talked about it with other Atlantic people, and I don’t want to claim credit for it. There’s a great story in this room about a very, very liberal place in America that for some reason can’t fix something that liberals claim that they could fix. I would love to see that story here. Goldberg: Will somebody text me later who’s working on that? Coates: They should. I’ll have them come to you privately because it’s their idea, and it was a great fucking idea. Goldberg: I’m looking for great fucking ideas! Speaking of great fucking ideas, here’s Jim Fallows. James Fallows: So I have a question that flows actually logically from what Carolyn and Emma and Gillian were saying, and what you all were both discussing. And this is a question I don’t have an answer for, and I don’t expect you, Jeff, to have an answer for now, but I think it’s a useful way to think about what we do next. In this case, it really has become impossible to separate the case that Kevin was making from the way he was making it. And there’s a whole sort of side terrain here. A particular tell that was really most significant to me was his explanation for why he said the little guy in Detroit was three-fifths of a person. He said, well, I’m six foot he was four foot. It just came naturally. When I hear six and four, I think two-thirds. [laughter] You know, I don’t think three-fifths. That’s something you have to have, um, there’s a different weight to that. Goldberg: Oh, showing off your math skills now. Fallows: But I think the question is, is related to what you were just saying, Ta-Nehisi, there are arguments that we — that I personally — wouldn’t agree with, but if made in a respectful, patient way, we’d want to have part of our realm. I think we can agree on ones that would not be in that realm. Many of you know here Jared Taylor, a guy who was once my friend in Japan. He makes a very respectful, erudite argument for racial superiority. He’s a complete, unapologetic racist, and we would not, should not publish his argument, no matter how well it was made.  We shouldn’t publish anti-Semitic arguments, no matter how well made. We shouldn’t publish birther arguments. Even though I personally am anti-death penalty across the board, because I think it’s discriminatory and too many mistakes, even though I think Roe v. Wade is both the settled law of the land and should be the law of the land, I can imagine us publishing a respectful, sane argument by somebody who said, I view abortion as murder, therefore I’m willing to carry my argument to its extreme and at least we make that case. I guess the question is, to define over time, what arguments — even if made in the best way — we would not countenance as part of our discourse Goldberg: It’s interesting because I think most of us know what those arguments are. We know them intuitively, and 99.9 percent of the time, our own editorial filtration systems work almost unconsciously, like they never actually emerge to be considered in a kind of way. I think that’s a thing worth noting. Making lists of things — I mean, this has come up from time to time, what don’t we do. It’s impossible because this is not a laboratory, you know. And it is not boxes, and things change and realities shift. Maybe 20, 30 years from now, The Atlantic will never publish an anti-choice piece, an anti-abortion piece. Maybe 50, 60 years from now, The Atlantic is going to publish on the cover that abortion is murder. I don’t know.  We don’t know because things shift. But I generally know when it’s my job, and it’s the job of other senior editors, to in a very live way, constantly think about where the parameters are and where the lines are. And I think, I disagree with Ta-Nehisi in the sense that, to me, the breaking point is, in this previous case, is the civility case, the “spirit of generosity” case. It’s like, you know, there’s a certain kind of writer who directs his merciless writing at powerful people, and we love that. But you know, there’s something implicit — the only thing that’s implicit to me in our journalism, implicit in the term “spirit of generosity” that manifests itself in our journalism, is we have to be merciful toward the weak. You have to start from position of, at least, understanding or empathy or something when it’s the weak. And this is where maybe things fell apart a little bit. But I think the lines are generally — I mean, am I wrong in thinking that? Coates: How do — how do you — Goldberg: I’m not running racist pieces, obviously. Coates: No, no, no. But how do you make, and maybe I didn’t quite hear you correctly, and if I didn’t, just correct me here — how do you make a civil argument for the death penalty for a procedure that huge numbers of Americans undertake right now? Fallows: So I’m saying, I entirely disagree with that perspective. I can imagine someone, you know, if Ross, our former guy, if he were pro-death penalty, I could imagine him making that case. Saying that he understands the brutal logic of what he’s saying. He understands this is not the civil law of the country for the last four-plus decades. He understands the tens of millions of people who would be affected, all of them women, but he nonetheless goes this way. Would we countenance that if he made that case? Goldberg: I ... Me? Probably not? I mean, I don’t know. I mean it’s a live thing. I’d have to read the thing and understand what the thing is. But you know, I just, I mean, going back to the point that Emma’s making, it’s like the Wild West — Coates: How do women in this room feel about that? Goldberg: Well, one of the things I would do is like, run it by — Coates: No, I mean like right now. Because we’re having this very abstract, theoretical argument — Goldberg: Are you taking a poll? Coates: No, I mean, we don’t have to take a poll. Somebody has the mic right now. Female staffer: [inaudible] I question whether his argument was made in the best way. If he’s not saying that men whose child this also is should also face the death penalty. [inaudible]. Fallows: And suppose he said that, too, suppose you were willing to embrace that in the argument. You know, until two days ago, we were hiring on our staff somebody who had this view. So we were willing, until two days ago, to countenance this view until we knew sort of all the peripheral stuff about how he was expressing it. Male staffer: Well, we’d countenance this view among our writers, not necessarily in our pages — that’s the distinction Jeff is making. Goldberg: Well, right. We weren’t countenancing the view, and this goes to — and by the way, this is an important thing for everybody who writes in the web age and social media age — we weren’t countenancing the view. He wasn’t going to write that for us. Right? And this goes back to the first iteration of this, which is the second-chance thing. The possibility that writers can grow and be better under the tutelage and guidance of The Atlantic. And so, I have a lot more tolerance for what I would consider to be mistakes people made at other organizations but show other talents than I would — it wouldn’t happen here because I don’t think our filters would let it happen. But we all are very well aware of the fact that everything that we say can and will be held against us in the court of social media opinion. Right? And so I don’t think that’s ... I think Bob’s right. It’s not something that he was going to do here. It’s the question of, is this characterologically where we’re at? And that was the question that sort of came up yesterday or the day before. Male staffer: I think the [inaudible] question is, from Gillian and from Jim, is whether — and Ta-Nehisi’s view is clear — whether, Jeff, you might have been comfortable publishing Kevin Williamson in a civil way on this point that Gillian ― Goldberg: On this particular point? Male staffer: Yeah, on this particular point, that I am pro-life and pro-death penalty, and I’m going to take that to the logical conclusion. And he’d done it in a Ross Douthat-style, Conor Friedersdorf-style voice, which Kevin doesn’t have. He’s a thoughtful person, but didn’t have that voice in his — Goldberg: I’m going to answer you — and I’m not dodging this — this meeting is so meta I can’t even stand it. Coates: You’ve got a woman with the microphone. That would make it less meta. Goldberg: I know, and I’m going to — Coates: We should — Goldberg: No, no, no. But let me answer his question and Rosa can come — and it goes to that point. The first thing I would do — I mean, one of the reasons that I’ve tried to promote so many women to leadership roles is because I want a lot of women in leadership roles so, when those questions arise, I can just say Adrienne [LaFrance], Swati [Sharma], Sarah [Zhang], Gillian [B. White], whoever, what do you think of this? Like, real experience. I think if Andrew — I mean, you had a problem with Andrew — I think Andrew trafficked in anti-Semitism. And I would have liked to have somebody talk about that when we were fighting it out all the time. You know, that’s why we have that. And I think I would put that piece first, up for discussion, with people who were actually that group, and let them actually think it through and then give me their advice and then make decisions accordingly. Rosa Smith: So, one thing that I’ve been thinking about, a common theme across all these questions, it seems to me that when we define the “spirit of generosity” as, sort of, the ability to accept other ideas or accept a wide range of ideas, that burden can sometimes fall heavier on some people than on others. Like as Ta-Nehisi pointed out, this question of hanging women who get abortions, it felt extremely personal, I think, for a lot of the women in this room. And so I’m wondering whether you define — sorry, I’m going to be one more person who asks whether you define the spirit of generosity primarily in terms of civility. And if so, how you would want to account for the fact that we can’t, as journalists, always separate ourselves from our ideas and the ideas that we’re able to take in. And the fact that an idea that some people might be able to think of as an abstract is very, very personal for someone else. Coates: I think that’s for you, Jeff. [laughter]. Goldberg: No, no, no. You can be the editor for a minute. Coates: I don’t think that’s for me. Goldberg: So, I’m going to give you the hard-edged answer. The hard-edged answer is that we’re journalists, and you have to separate how you feel from who you cover and what you write about. Very quickly, I spent half my career covering people, interviewing people, being with people who literally want to kill me—and six or seven times tried. OK? So, like, fine, whatever. I lived with the Taliban. I know they didn’t like me. And I’m not — but my job is to explain them, and be in their shoes and... I have a high tolerance. Part of the problem here might have been that I have an insensitivity or a high tolerance to offense. It just builds up. Right? That said, you know, as an editor I’m like, you know, this is not a safe space. This is The Atlantic. We’re a robust magazine of ideas and reported opinion and everything else. And so we all have to deal with the fact that we’re gonna work with people and with ideas that we just don’t like, and we’re going to come in proximity to them. On the other hand, as a manager, I want to make sure that everybody feels good and safe at their workplace and all of the things related to having a healthy, positive environment where there’s cohesion and a common purpose and everybody feels like they’re coming in and doing something positive and useful, and they don’t feel oppressed in the place that they work. That’s a complicated answer. I mean, I don’t want — but friction, on the other hand, is what makes really interesting journalism. And so we have to live in a kind of unhappy balance sometimes. But obviously, and I hope people know this about me by now, I really do love the people I work with. And I don’t want to do anything that ever hurts anyone. So that’s where I sort of am right now. Male staffer: With regards to Williamson, I just wanted to highlight the Laverne Cox piece, which I sometimes feel doesn’t really get discussed enough. And I think it was both very viciously argued and in a very unambiguous way. I thought about that while listening to Ta-Nehisi talk about being in an early newsroom with no people of color. I thought about that when, Jeff, you talked about a newsroom that made the decision to publish “The Bell Curve” without any oversight. And I guess I would encourage us to reflect on ways — on what our residual institutional blind spots still are, at The Atlantic. Even as we make good efforts to diversify our newsroom. Because we did not publish Kevin on Laverne Cox, but we did hire him, briefly, in spite of that. Goldberg: Well, I mean like I said very briefly I’m not going to hold everything — I mean, I agree with you on the piece, obviously. I’m not going hold everything that anyone ever said about anything against them when making those decisions. Maybe the calibration was off here, obviously. But yes, one of the reasons that we started the talent lab, and Christi … is here? I don’t know if Christi’s here. Hello, Christi. One of the reasons we’re trying to be very deliberate about thinking about where we’re underrepresented — and it’s not just underrepresentation for journalists. It’s underrepresentation because we want to bring in people who don’t know that they can be journalists and make them journalists, right? And so, obviously, I can’t sit here and make specific promises about a specific kind of hiring, but clearly, I think we’d be a better organization. You know, I just think we’re a better organization when you have people from all different walks of life and different backgrounds, and I mean ... I hope that you know that. Female staffer: Ta-Nehisi just threw a bit to the women in the audience by asking how we felt about hearing this conversation. I cannot speak for everyone. I know for me, hearing people discuss abortion and hanging as a punishment has been quite painful to hear, but I appreciate the spirit of this discussion and the fact that we’re having it. And I appreciate your asking that question, Ta-Nehisi, because I think understanding how people react to things is part of that conversation, even when it’s good. To me, when we talk about the logically complete argument around this, I see not just this idea of abortion and capital punishment, but then, this idea embedded within that — that the punishment for anybody who’s found culpable when it comes to a single homicide should be dead. Then it should be death by a means that many of us would consider barbaric, and that is not permitted even in states that allow the death penalty much of the time. So if someone were to have come to us with the argument that, you know, they believe that our criminal justice system should become much more punitive and more brutal and here are my reasons for it. And you know, if we find somebody guilty of murder even once, which is not always a capital offense, then we’re going to make it a capital offense — is that something that we as arbiters of the sphere of reasonable debate would have found tolerable more so if they hadn’t even begun with the abortion? Because I see that as the logically complete argument or the logical extension of that argument. Coates: I’m just answering this off the spot right now, so I can’t give a complete argument for this, but yeah, I’d be much more open to that. And I think part of it is the discriminatory nature of just putting it on — like, I’m not going to have an abortion. That’s never going to affect me at all. So I think part of it is the discriminatory nature of making it that way. Female staffer: Surfacing abortion as the main criteria when actually the question is, did you commit a homicide? Coates: I probably will be much more open to, as Jim said, a civil, well-reasoned — ugh — argument around that. Female staffer: Hard to envision that. Coates: But you know, it’s OK for me to go, “ugh.” I can do that. That doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be in the pages of The Atlantic. I’m not going “ugh” like you shouldn’t publish that. Goldberg: The default position always has to be, we’re going to publish something, an argument, unless there’s a very good reason not to do it. You know what I mean? I always want to leave it. Why, you know, not “let’s not even go near something,” [but] “let’s think about the hard things and figure out can we do this.” I always lean in favor of, like, “let’s explore it, and let’s push out and see where we’re at.” I think we have time for one more question. Christi, do you wanna? Christi Parsons: Thank you. Hi, I’m Christi. Appreciate this introduction to Atlantic culture this week. Week one. I don’t recall a conversation like this at the L.A. Times. Goldberg: There are more immediate problems at the L.A. Times. Parsons: Yeah, exactly. This is a nice luxury to have. Very often men who speak glibly about violence against women also turn out to be harassers in the workplace. I’m not making that accusation in this specific case. I just want to note that this seems like a moment when you can talk about your commitment to protecting the workplace and the culture of The Atlantic at a moment when you’re about to bring in an awful lot of new people in a really fast hurry. Goldberg: Yeah, I mean, thank you, Christi. And this is a simple one. I mean, those of you were here over the last year know that David and Bob and me and every other manager, we’ve been addressing this — especially since November, since the Weinstein thing. You know we have, I mean, we’re OK? [knocks on wood] You know, and the Atlantic culture I think you’ll experience is very strong. And the civility culture is very strong. And I’ve made it as clear as I possibly can that there’s zero tolerance for anything of the sort on the whole range of things that can go wrong in an organization related to this. There’s absolutely zero tolerance. We are a majority-female organization. We have, over the last year and a half, brought up a lot of women into leadership roles, not because they’re women but because I wanted to make a concerted effort to level the playing field so that women could get into leadership roles. I know from reading and talking to other people that having women in leadership roles in organizations doesn’t actually preclude the possibility of — NPR being a good example — the possibility of things happening. But I think everybody knows that the thing that we want to most defend against is the possibility that any woman would suffer in any way from the depredations that we’ve seen across the industry. Where was the other question? Vann Newkirk: I imagine when this Atlantic University was planned, we were going to talk about something else. The reason why we are talking about this is because Ta-Nehisi has become, even in some ways more than Kevin Williamson, the avatar of this conversation. I think [The National Review Online] has spilled more ink on you than they have on Kevin. Coates: Is that true? Newkirk: Well, when David French did the piece quoting both of you, he quoted you and did not quote Kevin. But it’s interesting. I mean you’ve seen all things about what you’ve written that might be considered beyond the pale. You’ve seen it. It seems to me that we are having a conversation resting on something of your moral authority, your role in this. As Jeff said, not in the hiring position, but in lending some sort of moral credence to what we do here at The Atlantic. How do you feel about that? And, Jeff, is that a sustainable thing? Goldberg: What do you mean sustainable? Newkirk: That we have a person like Ta-Nehisi, who is an amazing journalist and person and friend to many of us, who is sort of the ongoing center of many of these conversations about who we are and what we do. Goldberg: Is it sustainable? Coates: No, I understand what he’s saying. I understand exactly what he’s saying. Goldberg: You mean as a moral insurance policy? Or as a person who becomes a lightning rod for a lot of what is said about The Atlantic? Newkirk: I mean, I think it’s both. The lightning rod is part of the package. Coates: I understand what he’s saying. No, it’s not sustainable. Goldberg: Well, I’m not — your question is complicated. Coates: He’s saying, in the course of this debate, when people want to define what is tolerable for The Atlantic or what The Atlantic is willing to do, I’m brought up as evidence of it. Goldberg: And I don’t give a shit. Coates: Yeah, yeah, but maybe you don’t give a shit because — and I’m just being clear — because it’s not you. And also — Goldberg: Oh, you mean — no, I don’t give a shit what people say about you. Coates: That’s what I’m saying, well maybe you don’t give a shit ... [laughter] Goldberg: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. In terms of people pressuring me to do something about — Coates: No, I don’t think that’s Vann’s question. That’s not Vann’s question. It’s not “are you gonna fire Ta-Nehisi?” That’s not his question. Goldberg: No, no. I mean, no, no. Because you’re triggering me here because I get a lot of stuff about him. I get a lot of stuff about a lot of people. Coates: That’s his point, though. And not in “are you gonna fire ...?” Like, is it healthy in general. Everybody knows where you are in this. I mean, it’s not “are you going to fire this dude?” Goldberg: Is it healthy — what’s the healthy or unhealthy thing? Coates: Is it healthy to have — Goldberg: No, I mean, I’m sorry, because I got all self-righteous in my mind. And I was going to say — I mean, look, it’s very hard for me to disaggregate the professional Ta-Nehisi from the personal Ta-Nehisi because — Coates: Can you maybe repeat the question? Goldberg: No, I mean, I want to say that. I just feel the need to say this. I mean he’s one of the dearest people in my life. I’d die for him. So like — Coates: That’s not what he’s asking! Goldberg: I know! But — [laughter]. Coates: We all know that! Goldberg: No, I want you to know that. Coates: We all know this. That’s not his question, though. He’s clear on that. Goldberg: No, I want you to know that. Coates: I do know that! Goldberg: Can’t I just express my love for you? What’s so bad? What’s so wrong? Coates: Can I just say — and I would only say this sitting in this room — but that was a very white response. [laughter]. Goldberg: I’m very white! Why was it white? Coates: Because you’re going to this question of, I’m trying to prove, you know, I’m a good ally. I’m part of this. Goldberg: No! Coates: “I love Ta-Nehisi.” But that’s not actually what he’s asking. Goldberg: Well, I didn’t understand. I would die for Ross Anderson. He’s one of the whitest guys I know. Coates: That’s still very white, though — nobody is asking you to die! Goldberg: No! But — all right, fine. What’s the question, Vann? [crosstalk] Newkirk: What I’m asking is, he’s become, and I think this is fair, more than the sum of his journalism and what he does, the center of a conversation around who we are, what we do and what’s allowable here. And I was asking if that is a desirable position for us to be in, and if that’s a sustainable position for Ta-Nehisi and for you? Staffer: That’s not something we create though, right? Newkirk: I think we do in some ways. Goldberg: I mean, all we are and all The Atlantic is is the sum total of the people who work at The Atlantic and write for The Atlantic and edit The Atlantic, in a very basic way. And so, Ta-Nehisi was hired 10 years ago to do a thing, and because he’s Ta-Nehisi and because The Atlantic is The Atlantic he became a very famous person. I really, I’m not, I’m not tracking the question. I feel like Ta-Nehisi is, and I feel like Jim is the same thing, and a lot of other people — Megan is the same thing, you’re the same thing. And Conor and David Frum and all of that is The Atlantic together, and it’s hard to define that group. Right? And I’d like for things to be in a little bit of balance in those questions so it’s easy easier to explicate what we are and who we are. Of all the problems, that doesn’t strike me as a problem. Does it strike you as a problem? Coates: Yes! Goldberg: Well, why? Why does it strike you as a problem? Coates: Well, go ahead Vann, go. Don’t let me — Newkirk: I mean, I think if any of us swapped positions with Ta-Nehisi and were put in the position to be that moral authority, it would be a difficult position. And I think each of us who may be in line to be in the line of fire, perhaps, would say that’s a perhaps undesirable position. Coates: Well, I don’t think with just the sum total of our parts. I mean, let’s flip it, man. Let’s flip it like this. If we didn’t have — if there was someone here who, for instance, had and — good idea, bad idea — had written a cover that said abortion should be legal, in all cases, everywhere, right now. And had we done that, probably you would have seen that person in that position instead of me. Do you understand? Like, I think part of why that’s the case is who gets opportunities, who is cultivated to make really, really aggressive arguments. And then also, once those arguments are made, who we promote. You know, I appreciate that. I appreciate what you just said about the talent and all that and all of that stuff. I appreciate that. But I do think the machine is part of it. Goldberg: Do you think the machine is conscious? Coates: No, no, no, no. But that effect is the same, so it really doesn’t matter. But I think, you know, Jeff, like you got props yesterday from Nicole for this. I really admire what you’re doing. And I respect that, you know—I really think that diversity piece is really, really important. But then what happens after that is, it raises — you know, you don’t just become diverse, and everybody says “yeah!” and claps. Goldberg: Well, yeah, you become different. Coates: No! You don’t just become different. You uncover other problems. So the very fact that Vann is in the room is the reason why we’re having this discussion right now. Whereas if Vann was not in the room, this wouldn’t even be — we wouldn’t have this discussion. More problems that you may not have seen when you said, “Hey, we’re going to become diverse that will be a great thing,” become revealed. So it’s like an ongoing process.  And so what he’s pointing to — and I think this will be true; I don’t think it’s just necessarily true of me, I think it would be true of anybody else in this position — is, why is that the case? And I think part of the reason that’s the case is, for a very, very long time, I was the only black writer here. And we are dealing with the effects of that. That don’t necessarily follow you, it don’t even necessarily follow Bob or, you know what I mean, I don’t think people were consciously trying to say, let’s not get any black folks here. Or let’s not get any writers of color here. But there are effects of that. I mean there’s no other person here who is making those sorts of aggressive arguments. So, yeah, it ends up that you say, OK, who can I find that says shit at The Atlantic that feels like it’s outside of the mainstream. So then you become the tentpole — and this is my therapy right now — you become A) well, they let that guy write this, why can’t Kevin Williamson do this, B) well, that guy likes Kevin Williamson, what are the rest of y’all complaining about? Like, I don’t have the right to my own private opinion. And I should have actually recognized that before I started talking. That was my mistake. But writers want to write. You know, writers don’t want to be that. You know, no writer really wants to be that. And I think one way The Atlantic can help with that — and I think The Atlantic’s already helping with that, though, you might not see dividends from it for another five years or so ― is that piece of making sure that as you bring these folks in, who have not traditionally been here, that they get the opportunity to make those aggressive arguments.  That those people are promoted in our events, in our outreach. You know, like the stuff Anna [Bross, senior communications director] does— whoever talks to the press — that those people are pushed in a certain kind of way. And then I think it becomes, you know, less easy to put that on one person. Goldberg: Yeah. I mean, my goal is to make it look like as much of America as we can. And I don’t want that burden to fall on one person from each group to be that spokesman and avatar.  ",we,Let,questions
"The 300-acre landslide in Oso, Washington, which killed at least 30 people and destroyed the local community on March 22, 2014, reveals a consequence of a relatively unregulated and unseen industry: logging. Logging was not the sole cause of the disaster -- March was the wettest on record, a condition possibly exacerbated by climate change, and the geology of the area features soft soils -- but logging apparently played a major role.  The media often do not investigate the reasons behind an event such as the landslide, attributing to ""Mother Nature"" or ""Acts of God"" disasters that were actually manmade. For example, Time magazine called the Oso landslide a ""natural disaster"" without mentioning the likely influences of logging and climate change.  The plateau above the hillside that gave way has been logged for almost a century, and the hillside has a history of landslides dating back more than 60 years. For more than 25 years, as the slope became more unstable, scientists challenged the timber cutting and warned of possible calamity. Yet the state continued to allow logging on the plateau. A ""clear-cut"" is an area of land in which all the trees have been cut down. One suspected trigger of the Oso landslide is a clear-cut, undertaken 9 years ago, that apparently encroached into a restricted area and is only now being investigated.   The landslide, which occurred near the banks of the Stillaguamish River, was not only predictable; it was also predicted. New York Times reporter Timothy Egan recounts touring the headwaters of the Stillaguamish 25 years ago with Pat Stevenson, a biologist with the local Stillaguamish tribe: ""Stevenson pointed uphill, to bare, saturated earth that was melting, like candle wax, into the main mudslide. Not long ago, this had been a thick forest of old growth timber. But after it was excessively logged, every standing tree removed, there was nothing to hold the land in place during heavy rains. A federal survey determined that nearly 50 percent of the entire basin above Deer Creek had been logged over a 30-year period. It didn't take a degree in forestry to see how one event led to the other.""  Forest root systems hold the soil in place, and old-growth forests absorb about ten times as much water as clear-cut land.   Logging usually occurs far from the public eye. Most people remain unaware of the devastation wrought by typical modern logging practices, which rely on large machines and few workers to clear-cut the land. Near public roadways, uncut ""beauty strips"" of forest give passing motorists the illusion of unspoiled landscapes. Satellite images, however, often provide a very different, bird's-eye view of shorn forests.  Logging plans are not widely publicized. In my home state of Massachusetts, logging plans are filed with the town's conservation commission, which is often a group of volunteers. Even in the small town in which I live, and where I am relatively plugged-in to the goings-on, I was taken by surprise by the sound of logging machines near my house several years ago.  When people complain about rapacious logging, the toilet paper argument is invariably used to shut them up. The fact that we all use toilet paper is supposed to provide a carte blanche for loggers to do whatever they want to the forest. Yes, we all use wood, but many of the trees that are cut are wasted, often used to fuel biomass power plants, which have disastrous environmental impacts, or to create single-use pallets, junk mail and excess packaging. Much wood and paper ends up in a landfill or incinerator instead of being recycled or reused.  Logging proponents trivialize the damage from logging, arguing that although the land initially looks ravaged, the trees will grow back. They neglect to mention that this process takes decades and that invasive species may be what grow back. Forester Gordon Robinson writes, ""If logging looks bad, it is bad. If a forest appears to be mismanaged, it is mismanaged.""   A system of belief that defies science and justifies irresponsible logging has become entrenched in our government agencies and universities (particularly, in university forestry departments largely funded by the logging industry). One popular excuse for logging is to claim that the trees are diseased and need to be cut down for the good of the forest. Another popular excuse is that trees should be cut down to help wildlife. Loggers escape the burden of proving such claims. Government agencies often green-light logging without adequate environmental impact analysis or protection of vital resources.  Rather, the burden of proof that logging may be damaging unfairly falls on unpaid citizens. In 2006 and 2007, a group of citizens in Massachusetts applied modern science -- bringing in experts as needed -- to refute one unsupported excuse after another attempting to justify logging in Robinson State Park. The would-be loggers floated out 22 reasons to log the land,  and the citizens shot down each one. The state ultimately denied the timber company a permit; not one reason to log could be found that had any legs. Today, Robinson State Park is safe from logging and proves that intense public pressure can overcome even entrenched pro-logging bureaucracies. Logging is treated as a presumptive right, even on public land. For example, in Washington, if a permit application to log is not reviewed by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) within 30 days, it is automatically approved. And not only is enforcement of logging regulations lax, but the regulations themselves are inadequate.   Forestry seems to operate in the fantasy world of the 1950s, before the advent of modern environmental regulations. Paul Kennard, a geomorphologist with the National Park Service, explains that the DNR is pressured by timber companies, in a ""no tree left behind"" environment: ""It's a don't-rock-the-boat culture ... a very cronyistic, forester-friendly, we're-gonna-help-these-folks culture.""  Forests provide much more than wood. They hold our earth together, mitigate climate change, filter the air and water, cool the earth, provide flood storage, offer habitat and food for countless species and create a refuge for the human soul. Irresponsible logging erases these benefits, rolls out the welcome mat for invasive species and Lyme disease carriers and releases carbon dioxide, worsening climate change. It's time to halt irresponsible logging practices and bring the timber industry to accountability. Citizens can speak up to loggers and legislators. Wood harvesting can be done intelligently to supply what we need without damaging our lands, undermining our other resources and endangering our citizens.  Is our society unable to make change until catastrophic, headline-making fatalities occur? With the Oso landslide, this prerequisite has been tragically satisfied.

"A version of this article originally appeared on Gen[FKD]. Sign up for my newsletter to get my articles straight to your inbox. Most of us spend nearly nine hours a day engaged in media, technology or communications, but just a fraction of that time is spent talking on the phone. A 2014 Telegraph article reports that the number of landline calls has fallen by 38 percent since 2007. Meanwhile, even the average length of a cellphone call has dropped from 2.38 minutes in 1993 to 1.8 in 2012. Many of us view phone calls as distracting, superfluous and presumptuous, which is partly why phone communication is largely excluded from millennial career advice. We prefer email. But, in a few cases, they're still essential, superior modes of communication. Here are five times to get on the phone: If it's going to be awkward.
One Forbes article advocated email over phone conversation because there are no awkward silences or pauses in emails. But this awkwardness is exactly why we need phones. Silence is a form of listening, empathy, respect and expression. It's also a way of communicating: we receive valuable information from pauses. Conversations that may be awkward on the phone are more likely to be offensive, misunderstood or even incomprehensible by email. Because awkward phone calls can sometimes turn into catastrophic email exchanges, it's better to bite the bullet and bear the discomfort. If you want to build a relationship.
Phone calls humanize work communication in a way that email can't. Spoken words spark collaboration and laughter. We build relationships not by exchanging information but by feeling like we're together. Moreover, tone and context are easily misread in email, which can lead to unnecessary conflict and damage existing or potential relationships. ""It is hard to get the EQ (emotional intelligence) right in email,"" explains Anthony Tjan for Harvard Business Review. When you've scheduled it.
Calling someone out of the blue can feel confrontational and needy unless you have regular dialogue. In the age of email and calendar invites, there's nearly no reason to call someone without scheduling it first. This is both a courtesy and a productivity trick: by scheduling when the call will happen and how long it will last, you're more likely to stick to the agenda and allocated time. If you're negotiating.
When you're thinking about whether to call or send an email, ask, ""Is this a negotiation or a notification?"" Whenever you don't want something in writing or you're still talking terms or discussing, phone calls can sort out interests and information without setting anything in stone prematurely. On the other hand, if you're simply trying to share information as an FYI, the receiver would likely appreciate not getting a phone call. There's nothing to converse about; an emailed heads up would be better. There's a distinction between sharing data, where one person talks at the other and conversation ""where there's a coming together and more of an exchange,"" Dr. Richard Graham told The Telegraph. If it's time to close a loop.
Email gives people an opportunity to research and consider what's on the table. Phone calls, by contrast, require thinking and responding quickly and spontaneously, which can make them stressful or inadequate when we want to weigh our options and take time to respond. But, for this same reason, calls can also be a great way to close the loop. If an existing email exchange is persistently unclear or unsettled, a phone call can politely put people on the spot and get a definitive answer. In short, phone calls can remove a digital bottleneck and tie up an exchange so we can move on or forward. Takeaway
Fundamentally, how we communicate depends on what we're exchanging. If you're exchanging cut and dry information, email often suffices. If you're exchanging thoughts, ideas, opinions or potential terms for negotiation, a phone call may be warranted. Today, we have infinite ways of communicating information. Matching the right medium with the right topic can save us time and start more meaningful working relationships.

"In 1970, 26-year-old lawyer Sarah Weddington tried her first-ever contested case before the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. It was Roe v. Wade. Most Americans alre aware of the Supreme Court’s 1973 verdict in the watershed case, but fewer know the women who got us there.  Lisa Loomer’s play “Roe,” running now at Washington, D.C.’s Arena Stage, tells the story of the case that established a woman’s right to choose to have an abortion through the lens of two people: the young and ambitious lawyer Weddington and the case’s plaintiff Norma McCorvey, a 20-something bartender and lesbian who, in court, was known by the legal pseudonym “Jane Roe.”  In 2013, Loomer was approached by a friend about the possibility of writing a play about the case as part of a cycle of performances called “American Revolutions,” each recreating a moment of change in American history, commissioned by the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. Given Loomer’s previous work with narratives centered around women’s struggles, Roe v. Wade was of obvious interest.  “I was interested in the case, yes, but I was also interested in why this case is still being argued 44 years later,” Loomer explained in an interview with The Huffington Post. “I wanted to understand why we, as Americans, cannot even talk to each other about this issue. In other words, I was interested in the divide in this country, and I thought that by looking at the divide over Roe, I might begin to look at the larger cultural divide, as well. Which is, ironically, what we are looking at right now, post-election.” After an initial run in Oregon, the play premiered in D.C., just days before Donald Trump’s inauguration. Before the election, Loomer imagined the production existing in a different context. “We imagined it happening during the inauguration of our first woman president,” she said. “We thought it would be a cautionary tale, as history should be, but also a celebration of how far women’s rights and human rights have come,” she added. “Clearly, we were surprised. The play is happening now in a totally different political climate.”  The unexpected turn of events made “Roe” and its implications even more urgent, as Roe v. Wade’s ruling is now under unprecedented threat. One of Trump’s first actions as president was reinstating Ronald Reagan’s abortion “global gag rule,” which bans health organizations around the world receiving U.S. funding from mentioning abortion as a family planning option. And last week, Trump met with Judge William Pryor as a potential Supreme Court Justice, a man who called Roe v. Wade the “worst abomination in the history of constitutional law.”  In writing “Roe,” however, Loomer’s mission was never to convince her audience of the importance of abortion to women’s liberation. Rather, she wanted to tell the complex story of the iconic court case with tolerance and compassion, giving voice and credence to both parties.  “I did not want it to be a polemic,” Loomer said. “I did not want to further the divide. I feel that theater is a place where people — all kinds of people — can come together in the dark to look at an issue from a human point of view.  Theater is a place to feel. To laugh, cry, be surprised, and to live in another’s shoes for a while.”  Loomer tells her story through two protagonists: Weddington and McCorvey. At first, the women worked together on the case as allies. Yet, after the verdict, McCorvey became a born-again Christian and an anti-abortion activist. Weddington continued to champion women’s right to choose. “Their divergent journeys,” Loomer said, are representative of a broader picture. “Once I saw that odd turn of events, I thought it was a chance to tell the story of the cultural divide and look at why we can’t talk to each other as Americans.” In “Roe,” Loomer depicts the complex web of biases, fears and personal motivations that all humans grapple with regardless of their political affiliations. She also seamlessly highlights the effects that race, class and sexual orientation have on one’s opportunities and worldview. As a result, no minister, activist or millennial is stereotyped. There are no clear heroes or villains, just people ― messy, dedicated, and trying to do what’s right. During the play’s Washington run, Loomer speculates that most, but not all, of her audience leans liberal. Yet she’s received feedback from viewers on both sides of the political spectrum who appreciated seeing a nuanced and respectful picture of the other point of view. “Most people say that they went in very firmly sure of their stance, and they left sure of their stance, as well,” Loomer said of audience members who identified as both pro-choice and anti-abortion. “It didn’t change their mind, but it gave them an appreciation of the other side. For the first time, there was another side.”  In the future, Loomer hopes to take “Roe” to a theater in the southern United States, where the audience’s political breakdown would likely shift. The goal, again, isn’t to change minds, but to raise the possibility of open dialogue.  “My best hope is always compassion, a reverence for the complexity of human beings,” she said. “I think we can use that compassion now. I know it’s a time when people are extremely angry, and the last thing they want is to be asked to show compassion. Unfortunately, I just don’t know another way of even beginning to bridge this terrible divide in our country except for just listening to the other side. Just hearing it.” She also hopes to reach the young people in the audience, those who thought Roe v. Wade was another generation’s story. As Loomer said: “I think that people come away from the play with a deeper understanding of what is at stake, right now, in terms of choice.” “Roe,” a co-production with Oregon Shakespeare Festival and Berkeley Repertory Theatre, is written by Lisa Loomer and directed by Bill Rauch. It is on view until February 19, 2017 at Arena Stage in Washington, D.C.  Correction: An earlier edition of this article misspelled the playright’s name as Loomey.

"By Lorna O’Hara Feminism is experiencing a clear resurgence in popularity. In fact, a friend of mine recently told me that H&M is even selling t-shirts that say “Feminist” on them. You can look on the bright side and think that maybe that’s a good thing and that women are finally getting over the stigma that has surrounded the “F” word for so long, or you can cringe at the commodification of feminism, a school of thought that, when it’s done right, consistently critiques capitalism. But something is definitely happening. In fact, some claim that we’re in a “fourth wave” of feminism, one which aims to put into practice the inclusivity and intersectionality proposed in the third wave and which distinguishes itself by the use of new technologies, particularly the internet and social media. While these new tools have provided women with innovative ways of connecting and showing solidarity with each other across physical boundaries and have opened up new spaces in which we can talk openly about the challenges of being a woman and effect political change, they’ve also come with challenges. Social media platforms such as Facebook have modified their algorithms so that our newsfeeds are pretty much echo chambers where we just talk to those who we already agree with and are fed only the information and articles that interest us or affirm our already well-held beliefs. Not only that, but Facebook is still riddled with disturbing sexist and racist hate groups, which despite being reported, are often still allowed to stay active. It’s no surprise that this is the case when you see that most of those working in leadership positions at Facebook are white men. According to Facebook’s own figures released in 2015, men made up 68% of all employees, 77% of those in senior leadership and 85% of those working in technology. Now, that’s not to say that all these men are sympathetic to these groups, but rather that their privilege protects them from feeling genuinely under threat or attacked by their existence, and perhaps this is why removing these platforms of hate would appear to have slipped down on their list of priorities. And when we do manage to speak outside of our own circles on the internet, women are often on the receiving end of harassment, abuse and even death threats. Just as in any public space, there are men that will try anything to silence women. A recent survey carried out by digital security firm Norton found that nearly half of the 1,000 respondents had experienced some form of abuse or harassment online. Among women under 30, the incidence was 76%. And then there are the darker parts of the internet, for example the 40,000 strong “Incel” (involuntarily celibate) “support group” on Reddit, in which men discussed how much they hate women for “withholding” sex from them. This forum was recently shut down because it was basically a cesspool of hate speech where members often condoned rape and wrote such colourfully titled posts such as “All Women are Sluts”. The existence of such unbridled misogyny is truly a worrying barometer of how much hate there is out there for women. People like to dismiss such groups as the lunatic fringe, or dismiss online harassment as harmless because, after all, it’s “just the internet”. People like to think of the internet as somehow outside of “real life”, when the reality is that it’s an essential part of it, becoming ever more ingrained into our everyday lives and psyches. Harassment online is harassment and it mirrors the everyday harassment of women offline. While the current revelations about widespread sexual abuse and harassment against women and LGBTQ folk in the film industry may be shocking to some, it isn’t shocking to me, or to many women I know. Actors and comedians who, like wolves in sheep’s clothing, even made themselves out to be feminists themselves, have been exposed as abusers and harassers. It’s truly baffling, and yet sadly not surprising at all. One wonders how these men have been so oblivious to their own behaviour, claiming in some cases not to even remember the incidents themselves. Why is that? Is it because being an abuser is so natural to them, that they don’t even register these events as noteworthy? Are they so ignorant about relationships with others that they don’t know what sexual harassment or abuse is? Do they really not know what consent means? Or is it because they don’t fit the bill of the typical villain, you know, they weren’t wearing a cape and cackling wildly as they carried out the deeds, so how could they have done something wrong? How could they be the bad guy? Sometimes it’s genuinely hard to even imagine a future where women are treated equally and can feel safe, especially when we consider how common sexual harassment is. A Cornell University study carried out in 2014 in collaboration with Hollaback!, an anti-harassment NGO, shows that 81.5% of European women have been harassed in one shape or form by the age of 17. 64% of Irish women reported being groped or fondled in 2014 alone, while 80% of German women admitted taking another route to their home or another destination because of the fear of being harassed. I would argue that every woman has experienced some form of sexual harassment. And yet so many well-meaning men that I know express shock when I discuss how common these experiences are. So many men we know and love appear to be utterly blind to the behaviour of other men, some of whom they must know. It’s an everyday reality for women, but it shouldn’t be, and yet ironically some men are now claiming it’s a “dangerous time to be a man”—well welcome to the club, lads. They whine and throw their toys out of the pram, dubbing this wave of harassment allegations in Hollywood as “a witch hunt”. I couldn’t disagree more. After all, calling it a witch hunt would imply that these men are innocent and being wrongly accused, and in my opinion, it’s an offense to witches everywhere to be lumped in with these cretins. I’m glad they’re being exposed and I’m glad their victims are finding strength in numbers and coming forward. If we treat these incidents in Hollywood as a microcosm of the system in which we live, then I hope that it sets a new precedent where victims, famous or not, feel they can come forward and out their harassers. The #metoo social media campaign, which grew out of the news about Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulting numerous women, sparked an online conversation about how widespread and common harassment and abuse is for women. Scrolling through my newsfeed I wasn’t even remotely shocked, rather I was more surprised at the sheer volume of women who actually openly engaged in the conversation, women who in the past would have maybe even made fun of me for being a feminist, and that to me, was some progress. It gives us a gleam of hope that people feel like they can now come forward and talk about what happened to them, recognise it as a systematic problem and be listened to. Contrary to what some men may think, a feminist future is not some sort of dystopian one where all men should be afraid, but one where all men are aware of their sexist blind-spots, where harassers and abusers face the consequences for their actions, and where all women feel safe both in the private and public realms because they’re finally treated as equals.

"Dear Home Depot, You have held a special place in my heart for a long time. You color innumerable childhood memories. From the tiny wooden bookshelf I constructed at one of your workshops, to the orange apron I wore when I was taught to fix the kitchen sink, you’ve been there as I learned to build things. But today, you’ve disappointed me. Today, I walked up to your familiar sliding doors and saw this: A brief internet search revealed that this is a national advertising campaign sanctioned at an institutional level ― and one that you introduced two years ago. It seems that this has not been enough time for someone to point out to you the problems with this “she shed,” and since I love you and believe you can change, I’m going to try.  What makes a shed a “she shed”? In the words of your website, “If you think sheds are only meant for lawn mowers and tools, think again.” You offer appropriate fillers on the sign on the shed’s door ― arts and crafts, book clubs, yoga mats, accent pillows, your very own pantry. In other words, a list of stereotyped feminine hobby fodder ― as you say, “it’s all in the decorative finishes.” It’s easy to see what’s wrong with overt discrimination against women, but the “she shed” is subtler ― and therein lies its danger. “She sheds” exemplify benevolent sexism, a phenomenon that puts women on a pedestal, and at a distance. When women are stereotyped as “warm,” “maternal,” or “delicate” and in need of protection, they are denied agency and the opportunity to take on roles that don’t conform to traditional ideas of gender. Research shows that overt (or “hostile”) and benevolent sexism work together to reinforce gender inequality, and the “she shed,” a private space offered to shield a woman from a world that doesn’t belong to her, is a textbook example.  The she shed trend comments on a woman’s “place” ― the blog posts on the Home Depot website and the numerous ones elsewhere describe the sheds as a nook for (mostly stay-at-home) moms to get away from it all, to have their own space with no kids, no chores, and no husband. And yet they are almost universally depicted as being decorated like another room in the house ― the people who work all day as homemakers have to make another mini-home 20 feet down the lawn to have a space they can take ownership of, where they can feel comfortable? And in that space, they’re supposed to participate only in yoga, pilates, knitting, and sipping wine? I do not mean in any way to devalue these activities, but instead to point out how gendered they are ― they should be on a list of options that includes a wide spectrum of expressions of creativity or methods of relaxation, not just a tradition-entrenched subset of those deemed “acceptable” for women. Why can’t a “she shed” be filled with skis, metalworking tools, or indeed, lawn mowers? What makes a shed “for her” is not throw pillows and candles; it’s whatever the woman who designed it wants to fill it with. “She sheds” also subscribe to the idea of maleness as generic: by distinguishing a set of items as “for women,” Home Depot implies that femininity is “other,” that it has to be specified, that anything unlabeled (i.e. generic or “normal”) is for men. This is called androcentrism, and psychological research shows that it reinforces negative gender biases. As a woman walking into your store, this labeling of gender tells me that this item on the curb is meant for me, and the rest of Home Depot is not.  I’m a college student studying to be an aerospace engineer ― I was at Home Depot to pick up hardware for my summer job at a rocket manufacturing company. I’m frequently asked by high school students about what it’s like to be at my particular university, or to study what I do. Without fail, every young woman who I have spoken with asks: “What is it like to be a woman in engineering?” Not a single young man has had to ask what his experience will be like, because the male experience is viewed as the norm. He is welcomed into the high, orange walls of Home Depot with open arms and rows of lawn mowers. Home Depot, I have written you this letter because I am tired ― I am tired of gendered branding, “male” as “default,” and marketing teams who see nothing wrong with a “she shed.” I am exhausted by feeling an obligation to explain this form of sexism when I see such patronizing perpetuation of gender inequality. But I will continue explaining until I have a conversation with a woman in high school in which she does not have to ask how society will treat her if she wants to use her life to build things, until she can go to Home Depot to buy a hammer and not be boxed into a shed.",anything,sheds,men
"It’s no secret that women looking to get ahead in the tech industry often grapple with sacrifices and risks that their male counterparts don’t, but an upcoming book offers a glimpse at a lesser known element at play: exclusive, drug-fueled sex parties where claims of carnal liberation mask a problematic power dynamic.  Bloomberg veteran Emily Chang’s upcoming book, Brotopia: Breaking Up the Boys’ Club of Silicon Valley, denounces these freewheeling gatherings. An adaptation appeared in Vanity Fair on Tuesday. Chang spoke to nearly two dozen people familiar with these parties, in which men ― typically first-round investors, prominent entrepreneurs and high-ranking executives ― mingle with young, attractive women working in tech or other tech-aligned industries.  Anonymous sources described gatherings that are kept under wraps and often involve drugs, Chang wrote: This is how the night goes down, according to those who have attended. Guests arrive before dinner and are checked in by private security guards, who will turn you away if you’re not on the list. ... Alcohol lubricates the conversation until, after the final course, the drugs roll out. Some form of MDMA, a.k.a. Ecstasy or Molly, known for transforming relative strangers into extremely affectionate friends, is de rigueur, including Molly tablets that have been molded into the logos of some of the hottest tech companies. Some refer to these parties as “E-parties.” The sources said attendees are encouraged to become intimate with other guests. Oftentimes, the hosts enforce a higher ratio of women to men and lean “heavily toward male-heterosexual fantasies,” Chang observed. “Women are often expected to be involved in threesomes that include other women; male gay and bisexual behavior is conspicuously absent.” While many of the men Chang spoke to view these gatherings as another way they’re disrupting the world, women face a dilemma: Skipping the party means missing out on the business deals and networking that take place there, but attending may have its own set of consequences.  “If you do participate in these sex parties, don’t ever think about starting a company or having someone invest in you,” one female entrepreneur told Chang. “Those doors get shut. But if you don’t participate, you’re shut out. You’re damned if you do, damned if you don’t.” Other women who spoke to Chang said their male colleagues aggressively pursued and sexually harassed them after they found out they had attended some of the gatherings. That predicament isn’t surprising, given Silicon Valley’s history of gender discrimination: Women in tech are paid less, kept out of high-ranking roles and face rampant sexual harassment. The biggest tech sexual misconduct scandal to unfold last year was at Uber, which fired 20 employees after harassment allegations blew up.  Chang’s book is due to be published next month. You can read the full adaptation here. ",adaptation,appeared,Tuesday
"By Martyn Herman PARIS (Reuters) - Claycourt king Rafa Nadal regained his Roland Garros throne after two years in exile with a brutal 6-2 6-3 6-1 mauling of Swiss Stan Wawrinka to complete ‘La Decima’ on Sunday. Rewinding the clock to the days when he was untouchable on the crushed brick dust, the 31-year-old turned 2015 champion Wawrinka into a human punchbag, winning in just over two hours. This title, an unprecedented 10th at a single grand slam in the professional era, was arguably the most impressive of his 15 though as it arrived three injury-plagued years after the last one, without dropping a set and conceding only 35 games in seven matches. Only Bjorn Borg, who conceded 32 on his way to the 1978 title, has been a more ruthless champion. Having beaten world number one Andy Murray with a majestic display of power in the semi-final, third seed Wawrinka arrived full of confidence as, at 32, he tried to become the oldest French Open winner since Andres Gimeno in 1972. But the barrel-chested ‘Stanimal’ was powerless as Nadal turned the final into an exhibition of his clayclourt supremacy ― taking his French Open record to an eye-watering 79-2. As a weary Wawrinka sliced a volley into the net on match point Nadal collapsed on his back on the baseline. “I’m a little emotional,” Nadal said before getting to clamp his jaws on La Coupe des Mousquetaires. “The nerves and adrenaline I feel on this court is impossible to compare.” Straw hats and fans were de rigueur for an expectant Court Philippe Chatrier as the final began with temperatures hovering around the 30 degrees Celcius mark ― perfect conditions for Nadal’s trademark monstrous topspin game. Wawrinka, who spent nearly five hours more on court than Nadal to reach the final, looked tentative and heavy-legged although he did have a glimmer in the third game when Nadal was forced to save a break point. FIRST BLOOD Nadal failed to convert any of the four break points he had in the following game, but drew first blood the next time an opportunity arose to take a 4-2 lead. Then he switched on the afterburners. A matter of minutes later Wawrinka wafted a forehand long to hand Nadal a second break of serve and the opening set. Wawrinka was flat, striking not a single winner off his glorious single-handed backhand in the first set, and with less than an hour on the clock his task already looked forlorn. Nadal was given a time violation warning at the start of the second, but Wawrinka could not halt his charge as the Spaniard bounded into a 3-0 lead in the second having won seven games in a row. With the crowd attempting to lift Wawrinka he stopped the rot to hold, firing himself up with a roar of “C’mon”. Nadal was relentless though, pinning Wawrinka back behind the baseline. Even when he was stretched the response was emphatic, one astonishing forehand, whipped from close to the front row of seats to land in the corner, drawing gasps from the crowd and applause from Wawrinka. Social media lit up at that point with women’s semi-finalist Timea Bacsinszky tweeting “OMG!” Wawrinka could not lay a glove on Nadal and his frustration boiled over as the Spaniard closed in on a two-set lead, destroying his racket frame after a missed forehand. After Nadal sealed the second set both players left the court while court staff watered down the red dust. Nothing could extinguish Nadal’s fire though and he surged two breaks ahead in the third set despite the best efforts of Wawrinka to try and extend the contest.   (Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Toby Davis)",opportunity,failed,lead
"I don’t want to call myself a Christian anymore. To clarify, I don’t want to be known as an American Evangelical Christian. For years, I wore that label comfortably and confidently, as it has been the core of my identity since my earliest memories. But now, that label makes me uncomfortable, and even disgusted, and I want the rest of my life to be defined by something very different. As a child, my Christian faith was just as much a part of my identity as my brown hair, my shyness, and my love of softball. My family was at church every Sunday, we prayed before dinner, and read the Bible before bed. I went to church camps, youth retreats, and Christian concerts. I attended a Christian high school, and pledged a Christian sorority in college. The Christian label accompanied a good majority of my activities, even through early adulthood. Today, as a not-so-young adult and a mother, I find a lot about my Christian upbringing problematic. And now, in 2017, my eyes are wide open to how much of the world views my faith, and in many ways I don’t disagree with that perception. I’m horrified and embarrassed at the ways American Christianity is promoting nationalism, political agendas totally contradictory to Christ’s teachings, and a president who in no way represents the Jesus I was taught to love. The adults who mandated I wear a one piece swimsuit to church camp (to fulfill some arbitrary standard of “modesty”) also cemented a core belief that sex outside of marriage is sinful and damaging. And I believed them. I followed all the rules and wore the right clothes. I saved myself until marriage, which had it’s own far-reaching consequences, regardless of how Biblically I behaved. And then, many of these same adults endorsed Donald Trump for president, even after undeniable evidence that he is an adulterer, misogynist, and sexual assaulter. And I am devastated. The Christian leaders who taught me that every life is sacred, who sang Jesus loves the little children...all are precious in his sight, are silent or make flimsy excuses about escalating racism and police brutality in our country. They celebrate travel bans that discriminate based on religion, but are all for Christians being able to discriminate because of their religion. They boast tagline in their church bulletins saying Come as You Are...but wait, not if you’re gay. I will never understand how so many Christians who have worn, marked up Bibles and prayer journals continue to support the political party who seems intent on destroying access to healthcare for the most vulnerable Americans. The poor and disabled in this country (as well as millions of children) are facing massive cuts to Medicaid. Without Medicaid, how are these people going to get the healthcare they need to live? For those that say it’s the church’s job to take care of the sick and poor, where is the evidence for that being a sustainable, long term solution? Because right now, the church is missing the need by a long shot. I don’t believe the church has a responsibility to pay my child’s exorbitant medical bills, but I do  believe as a Christian, I have a responsibility to graciously contribute to the programs that are capable of meeting those needs. Most of the time, that means I pay my taxes so programs like Medicaid can exist to take care of the poor and disabled. I feel like a child who has discovered her parents have been lying to her for decades. How could I have missed this? How did I not realize how off I was about the religion that shaped the path of my entire life? How do I reconcile that both elders and peers in my faith think a president who bullies journalists, mocks the disabled, and repeatedly disparages women’s physical appearances is perfectly acceptable, so long as he is “pro-life”, “pro-Israel” and “pro-America”? It seems to me that the selling out of an entire religious moral code is a steep price to pay for a Supreme Court nominee or two. I’ve been told I need to pray for our leaders. What exactly am I praying for? Because prayer alone isn’t going to fix the mess that our country is in. Prayer alone isn’t going to save Medicaid for millions. Prayer isn’t going to allow refugees fleeing terror to enter our country. Prayer isn’t going to give a desperate woman seeking an abortion resources and support so she is able to keep her baby. And prayer certainly isn’t going to take away Trump’s twitter and keep him from acting like a junior high boy with no filter. So yes, I will pray. But I’m also going to do something. I’m not going to hide behind my Bible, or my privilege, and stay quiet about injustice because it may not impact me personally. I’m not going to show up at church on Sunday, talk about God with a bunch of people just like me, and pretend that makes me a good Christian, or even a good person. I’m not going to stay out of politics, despite being whispered about behind my back by pearl-clutching Christians who find “liberal” and “Jesus” to be incompatible terms. The Jesus I know was loving, fair, and gentle, but he was also bold. And political. I really don’t know where I go from here. I’m frustrated, angry, and lonely. I’ve lost friends, and the foundation of my entire life has been cracked, probably irreparably.  I don’t know how to answer my children’s spiritual questions, because none of my answers feel genuine anymore. But I’ve decided I don’t need all the answers immediately, and I’m content to be discontent and wandering a bit right now. I may be disillusioned by religion, but I don’t doubt God and His power in my life. I also don’t doubt that He loves me, even with my instinct to walk away. I still want to be a Christian, but need a new definition of what that truly means. ",I,attended,college
"Twitter is dragging Joel Osteen. And he deserves it. He deserves every nasty tweet, every bit of bad PR ― all of it, including these: Joel Osteen: We will pray for the people of Houston.Houston locals: Can we use your church for shelter?Osteen: pic.twitter.com/xhfke5LfWy Joel Osteen's thinking ""if you give a man a fish he eats for a day. Lock your megachurch during a huge storm, teach a man how to be a fish."" Religion has gone from Jesus telling his disciples “Truly I tell you, it is difficult for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven” as he walked about the unwashed masses tending to the sick and feeding the poor, to “I will open my doors of my church when all the other shelters have filled up.” And it’s easy to hate on Joel Osteen with his shampoo commercial hair, thousands of dollars in capped teeth, a mansion a Saudi prince would say was too ostentatious, and best selling books that are basically a collection of inspirational sayings from office wall art. But the real culprit is prosperity gospel. Prosperity gospel’s tenet suggesting having faith, tithing, and donating to the church will bring wealth and prosperity to you is a big bunch of malarkey. Plant seeds of money and in return money, wealth, and prosperity will be sown, preachers say. It’s the Trump University of religious beliefs. It’s like a casino without the bright lights and loud sounds of the slot machines. It’s a ponzi scheme that Bernie Maddoff would have applauded. And with prosperity gospel, you don’t have to hide your wealth. Flaunting it is how you receive more donations. Joel Osteen lives in a $10.5 million mansion. Creflo dollar has two Rolls Royces, a private jet and three multi-million dollar mansions. TD Jakes’ net worth is north of $140 million. Bishop David Oyedo’s church, Winners’ Chapel, seats 50,000 people and his net worth is $150 million. People seem to want a rich pastor. They truly believe that these guys deserve to have millions, and you can receive millions too if you give them your hard earned money. But that’s the real issue. Not everyone can be successful. We all can’t and don’t have million dollar mansions like Osteen or Pat Robertson. So does that mean we haven’t prayed hard enough? What about the child who has leukemia? Or the person who lost their job? Or the thousands of people who had every possession swept away in a flood? These people didn’t do anything to deserve the problems they are currently having. So where is God’s favor for them?  Prosperity gospel implies that if you aren’t prosperous, it’s because God has not blessed you. And that makes it easier to turn people away as Osteen did. If TD Jakes and the rest deserve to be rich, then the people who aren’t deserve to be poor. If these people are getting what they deserve, then the rest of us are under no obligation to help them, right? No need to feed, or clothe, or shelter them. The rise in the maliciousness of people and their utter disdain for the poor has coincided with the rise of the prosperity gospel. So while Osteen is facing a PR crisis, the rest of the peddlers of prosperity gospel should take heed. To quote Ghandi  ― “I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ.”",dollar,has,Royces
"Along with President Donald Trump, the hosts at “Fox & Friends” issued their support Monday for Gina Haspel, the acting CIA director whom the president has nominated to officially take over the post. Haspel’s controversial tenure at the CIA and involvement in the agency’s program that used torture techniques has prompted Democrats and Republicans to raise concerns about her nomination. In the fight against al Qaeda soon after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Haspel served as the head of a secret CIA site in Thailand where harsh interrogation tactics, including waterboarding, were used on “high-value detainees,” according to multiple reports. Her Senate confirmation hearing is scheduled for Wednesday, but Haspel reportedly offered to withdraw her name from consideration over the weekend before senior White House officials persuaded her to remain as Trump’s nominee. Trump tweeted his support for Haspel and defended her record on Monday, and the president’s favorite morning show echoed his sentiment.  ″Thirty-two-year career ... and I think she should double-down and say, ‘I’m proud of what I accomplished ― whether it was black sites’ enhanced interrogation ― and I dare anyone to sit in my shoes and accomplish as much as I’ve done,’” co-host Brian Kilmeade said. Kilmeade’s colleagues piled on. “Just keep in mind, whatever she did when she was in power at that point, she was doing it as a directive and it was all within the law,” co-host Steve Doocy added.  Take a look at the full clip in the video above.",tactics,served,reports
"“Doesn’t Look Like Anything To Leigh ... And Bill” is HuffPost’s weekly recap where we look at the craziest thing you may have missed on “Westworld.” This week: Season 2, Episode 1, “Journey Into Night.” When “Westworld” brought itself back online Sunday night, we immediately stopped and shouted, “Whoa, baby!” Namely because of the title sequence for Season 2, which is reminiscent of Season 1′s layout with a few new additions ― including a baby. To get the inside scoop, we talked to the creative director behind the titles, Patrick Clair. But first, let’s discuss a popular and relevant “Westworld” theory: A “Westworld” fan theory that’s been around since the first season supposes that androids could eventually make babies ― children we’ll affectionately refer to as robotots. “Robot babies?!” was Luke Hemsworth’s reaction when we spoke to him about the opening credits this month. The actor, who plays security officer Ashley Stubbs on “Westworld,” said he saw the Season 2 premiere for the first time in Los Angeles on Monday and insisted he didn’t remember the “little robot babies.” Well, Stubbs, we’re here to fill you in. Robot reproduction makes a whole lot of sense, and it could be the next logical step in the androids’ quest to become the superior race. There was even speculation in Season 1 that procreation was the final step of the ever-confusing maze. After all, there’s a little dot under the figure in the maze drawing (conveniently located on a scalp below). Could it possibly represent new life?  The reproduction angle didn’t happen in Season 1, and the maze turned out to be about the robots finding true consciousness, but there are subtle hints that it’s still a lingering possibility. For example, one of the Season 2 trailers used Nirvana’s “Heart-Shaped Box” as a backing track ― you know, the song from their album “In Utero.” If that doesn’t scream robotots, what does? Furthermore: those title sequences we were talking about. In the latest season premiere, we get a glimpse of a mother and child in the opening credits. The vignette replaced Season 1′s scene of two robot lovers. The sequence’s designer, Clair, didn’t outright confirm robotots are on the way, but he did say the titles might hint at what’s to come. While reflecting on the mother and child scene, Clair told us, “What really affected me most watching Season 1 was the bond between parent and child, and mother and baby, and I think led us to be like, what could we do that has the emotional resonance of the lovers but goes in a new direction of where the story has been, where the story is going?” “I think there will be some real rewards for people as the season plays out,” he added. “They’ll start to really be able to realize what that means and its place within the titles.” So ... robotots confirmed? At least Hemsworth is into the idea. Though he missed the baby in the opening sequence, he told HuffPost, “Would I be surprised if something like that happens? It’s an interesting direction, for sure,” he laughed, continuing, “It’s very scary but I think it’s on par with the innovation of the show. Whether we see anything like that anytime soon, I don’t know. Once robots can have babies, I think the outlook for the human race is probably pretty bleak.” All we’re saying is: why not? There are so many advantages. You can put your baby in sleep mode whenever you want, and they probably have a Wifi connection. Who wouldn’t want a hot spot in their robotot? While we’re waiting for more on that possible reveal, Clair was also kind enough to walk us through the other additions to the updated opening credits.  On the falling buffalo, Clair said, “This was how buffalo or bison could be hunted back in time where they could kind of be cajoled into diving off cliffs, and you have this tragic moment of them falling to their deaths. [It’s] tragic for the beast, but obviously they’re generating food and feeding the circle of life, and I think for us, that became an interesting theme because so much of the ‘Westworld’ titles are about the circle of life.” ″[In the first season], we use the iris of the hosts ... to reflect the landscapes, so when we were looking for something that could do the same thing as the iris you kind of realize there’s this quite beautiful object ― we call it the pearl. It’s the brain of the host, so we sort of went about imagining how that could look in extreme close up.” He told us the idea was “visualizing neural networks like the ones search engines use, like the ones that image recognition uses, and then imagine how that could work in a more complicated three-dimensional space.” Season 1 titles end with a host sinking back into liquid. Clair wanted to insinuate a sense of progression in Season 2′s opening, so he based the image of the host on photographs looking up from water into the sky. “We got this imagery of this mysterious black hat drifting into the abyss while the host is actually emerging from this dark liquid. Having that host be a female host ... there are so many empowered characters from Season 1. [There] are amazing badass female robots, so this felt like a slightly more empowered way to kick off the episodes of Season 2.” The image of the baby was a personal experience for Clair, who has a 5-year-old son of his own. “Realizing that you’re bringing this very sacred thing into the world, bringing a mind into the world, that’s everything that ‘Westworld’ is about. It’s about the sacred mysterious responsibilities of giving rise to conscious minds. It’s something that all of us have experience of from a child’s perspective, and so many of us have experience from a parent’s perspective, and I think any imagery there can kind of evoke that from the start of this story is a good kind of setup for where it’s gonna go.” “I think if you saw the lovers or the mother and child in full light, you would be horrified. It would give you nightmares. Those beings, the way we designed them, is based on where the light falls on them. Where the light falls on them, they’re fairly complete.” To create the figures of the lovers and the mother and child, the design team started with anatomical models and then peeled back layers until they are “deeply grotesque.” Those parts of the characters remain in the shadows. “Being very careful with the light, hopefully, you don’t see that, but you get a sense of that there. Maybe one day we’ll show everyone what it looks like if you actually turn the lights on in that room.”  To read more of HuffPost’s “Westworld” coverage, head here. ",who,was,own
"The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has reinstated one its employees after suspending her last month following reports that she shared numerous bigoted memes in 2016 and 2017. Ximena Barreto, who was appointed to be the department’s deputy director of communications in December 2017, was placed on administrative leave while the agency conducted a review of her social media accounts. With the review complete, Barreto has been permitted to return to work in a role outside of the public affairs office, an HHS official told HuffPost. The department has not received any complaints related to Barreto’s conduct during her tenure, the official said. Barreto apologized in a statement for making what she termed “emotionally-charged comments,” as first reported by CNN on Tuesday. “In the heated and hyper-passionate political campaign environment, I made generalized comments regarding race relations & radical Islam,” Barreto said. “I fully understand that these emotionally-charged comments were hurtful, & I deeply apologize to members of both communities.” “I love America and its people,” she added in the statement. “I have many, many friends of all races and religions, and I look forward to working hand-in hand with them all as we labor to improve our nation for future generations. America is the land of opportunity, I hope for the opportunity of understanding and forgiveness.” HHS suspended Barreto after progressive media watchdog Media Matters reported on offensive social media posts she shared as a fringe right-wing political commentator before her appointment to the agency. Using the screen name “RepublicanChick” on her personal website and social media accounts, Barreto repeatedly attacked Islam, calling the religion a “cult” that has “no place” in the U.S. She also peddled the “Pizzagate” and Seth Rich conspiracy theories. In May 2017, she retweeted an image saying that America’s forefathers would have “hung” former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for treason. Roughly three months later, she shared an image of Obama labeled as a “Muslim terrorist.” As noted by CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski, the department’s statement did not address Barreto’s social media posts on conspiracy theories or Obama being “hung.” Other Trump administration officials have left their positions after media outlets combed through their social media accounts. Todd Johnson, a former aide to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, resigned as a Defense Department staffer after CNN reported on his past racist and Islamophobic posts. In September 2017, William C. Bradford resigned as the head of the Department of Energy’s Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs after racist and anti-Semitic tweets he shared in 2016 surfaced. This article has been updated with additional information from the HHS official and from Barreto’s statement. ",she,apologized,Tuesday
"The concept of work looms large in the American imagination. Whether it was the workers who laid the first railroad tracks or took shifts at our first factories, workers transformed the American economy into the envy of the world. Work provides a paycheck, status and dignity.  In the 21st century, technology and globalization have forever changed the workplace and the social contract. Unfortunately, the laws and traditions that help workers have not.  Work is changing faster than ever. In the past, many workers joined a company and remained until retirement, taking advantage of employer-provided health care, pensions and insurance. This model is fading as firms move, restructure and even die as a result of global competition and technological change. Eastman Kodak was an American icon that brought magic into homes around the world with color slides and photographs.  At its peak, Kodak employed almost 150,000 people. Five years ago, Eastman Kodak went bankrupt as new technology made the company obsolete. Technological progress leads us to new economies and opportunities, but it often also leads to great economic and political disruption. Millions of Americans have lost jobs and wage growth. The “gig economy” now offers new sources of income through companies like Task Rabbit, Uber and Airbnb, but without the traditional security companies like Kodak provided. It is now essential that lawmakers modernize laws and regulations to seize the opportunities and anticipate and manage disruption. That’s why we established the Future of Work Task Force within the New Democrat Coalition. The New Democrat Coalition is a group of forward-thinking, pro-innovation Democrats in the House of Representatives working to fashion laws for the economy of the future. We have convened public panels with workforce experts, business and labor leaders. We have studied the growing literature on the future of work and talked with Americans experiencing workplace change. We have identified four major trends affecting how Americans work. First, while automation and artificial intelligence increase productivity, they also lower some wages and eliminate certain jobs. Second, the accelerating pace of technological change requires workers to more frequently change occupations. Third, the rise of the “gig economy” puts more workers into jobs that lack traditional worker protections and benefits. Finally, the increasing complexity of modern business has slowed new business formation, dampening the engine that creates good middle class jobs.  The New Democrats are working on a 21st century system of worker benefits and protections. According to the Rockefeller Institute, the independent workforce could account for one-third to one-half of the total in 2020. As many workers change jobs more frequently, traditional employer-provided benefits and protections will not meet their needs. We believe workers should have access to benefits and protections that are portable and connected to them regardless of where they work. As more industries rely on automation and new technology, the economy will depend on a workforce with a flexible set of skills.  Historically, workers left school and relied on their employer for on-the-job training. Today, more workers need to be self-reliant in updating their skills to keep their jobs or compete for new ones. We must build and promote a culture of lifelong learning. Growth and opportunity require robust new business creation. New businesses have created on average 1.5 million jobs a year over the last three decades. We must spur entrepreneurship and make it easier to start new businesses everywhere, not just in places like Palo Alto and Manhattan. We must work together to lower overly burdensome regulatory obstacles to innovation and entrepreneurship, limit the growth of “non-compete” clauses in employment contracts, and increase access to capital.  The 40-hour workweek, the establishment of a federal minimum wage, employee benefits, and the right to organize protected workers during the post-war economic boom and built the American middle class. These achievements created the foundations upon which our economy has established the promise of the American dream. But now we must find real solutions so future generations of Americans have the opportunity to compete in the economy of the future. Let’s work together to make sure that dream remains strong for ourselves and for our children.",Democrats,working,benefits
"From Mother Nature Network's Jaymi Heimbuch: Bald eagles are making headlines again, as proven by NPR's recent story about the birds' amazing recovery in Chesapeake Bay.

""Today more than 10,000 eagle pairs nest each year across the Lower 48, and many more in Alaska. And nowhere is their comeback more dramatic than along the James River, where they once again dominate the avian scene,"" writes Elizabeth Shogren.

bald eagle""Forty years ago, we probably would not have seen a single bald eagle here,"" says Bryan Watts, a conservation biologist at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va. ""A prime contributor to their disappearance in this region was located just upriver, where Bailey Creek meets the James. In the 1960s and 1970s, Allied Chemical Corporation produced a pesticide called Kepone (chlordecone) at its plant in Hopewell, Va.""

This is a familiar story across a nation where pollution and pesticides nearly wiped out the species in the United States. The bald eagle was on the endangered species list for decades, and massive recovery efforts were put into place to bring the national symbol back. It was delisted in 2007, and stories of its recovery have continued to be a source of celebration from Glenwood, Iowa to Chicago to Sandy Island Eagle Sanctuary in Missouri. The fascination with watching this species come back with vigor has been equally as wonderful as witnessing the recovery itself. Some efforts to help endangered species recover can be controversial, but the recovery of the bald eagle has been a story everyone can get behind. A bald eagle nest cam in Decorah, Iowa brings in millions of viewers every season as the parents hatch their chicks. It's not often a livestream angled on a bird's nest gets that kind of viewership!

The conservation effort has not been easy and is still a challenge in some areas, such as the Channel Islands off the California coast. Bald eagles once called these islands home but disappeared with the emergence of the pesticide DDT. In addition, humans changed the ecosystem there by introducing invasive species. Restoration efforts have included removing the alien species and helping native species, such as the endangered Channel Island fox, recover. A program for reintroducing bald eagles that started in 2002 has been a success, with 2010 seeing a record-setting 15 wild chicks hatched. But the reintroduction of bald eagles to their historic habitat on the islands presents a new concern: bald eagles may see endangered foxes as a prey source, should their preferred marine prey of fish decline. Right now, it is simply a tenuous wait-and-see game for the foxes as eagle numbers rise.

And there are other variables. TreeHugger reported in early 2012 on a new danger the bald eagle species faces. ""The culprit is a neurological disease known as avian vacuolar myelinopathy (AVM) that causes brain lesions and impaired motor skills that ultimately result in death. First observed in Arkansas in 1994, instances of the condition have steadily increased and spread across the country."" The culprit seems to be blue-green algae, which becomes concentrated in the eagles' prey. The next steps will be watershed management to minimize exposure to the algae.

While there are many dangers that still face the bald eagle, the incredibly successful recovery over the last several decades is a conservation story to champion — and one to instill hope for other endangered species whose recovery is still underway.",parents,brings,chicks
"A small California town has found an unlikely champion during the massive California drought: its brewery. Bear Republic Brewing Company recently installed a water-recycling, energy-generating system at its craft brewing facility in Cloverdale, Calif., a town on the Russian River that the Department of Public Health has named one of the communities most vulnerable to running out of water during the state’s mega-drought. The EcoVolt system, originally designed for the U.S. military, will supply more than 10 percent of the facility’s water needs with recycled water and produce enough biogas to cut back 50 percent of the brewery’s electricity use, significantly reducing both the company’s carbon footprint and production costs. “We were looking for ways to conserve water in the face of threatening drought and saw the EcoVolt system being installed in a nearby winery,” Bear Republic owner and CEO Richard Norgrove Sr. said. The brewery business is a big water-sucker; typically, production uses ten times the amount of water than beer produced. Bear Republic reports keeping their ratio at less than half that in producing their 72,000 barrels a year, and that was before installing the EcoVolt. “We’ve worked hard to reduce our water use to a 3.5 to 1 ratio,” Norgrove told the North Bay Business Journal. “With EcoVolt we expect to do even better. The city of Cloverdale red-lined us at 8 million gallons of water a year, but we use less than that.” In Cloverdale, where the state’s record drought has diminished the Russian River to a mere trickle, corporate commitment to water sustainability is of high importance. The Department of Public Health named Cloverdale one of 17 communities in danger of running out water within as few as 60 days. The town has implemented mandatory water conservation and banned certain uses, though city officials have announced they think the DPH’s inclusion of Cloverdale on the list was an exaggeration. Bear Republic’s efforts to confront the water shortage aren’t new. In November of last year, the brewery struck a deal with the city and paid nearly half a million dollars for the construction of two wells Cloverdale couldn’t have otherwise afforded. They’re set to open in July, and city officials say that day can’t come soon enough.  ""The whole water situation doesn't look good at all, no matter how you look at it anyway,"" Cloverdale Vice Mayor Robert Cox told the San Francisco Chronicle this week. ""The Russian River is where we get our water, and it's just about dry. There's no rain. About the only good news on the horizon is those new wells.”

"Michael Bennett is of the NFL’s good guys. When teammate Cliff Avril ran a race last weekend to help raise money for juvenile Diabetes research, Bennett was there all day to offer his help. When Avril went to Haiti to build schools and help provide clean water, Bennett was there with his sleeves rolled up. He also takes many opportunities to visit juvenile detention centers and speak with kids. And, when former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick stunned sports fans by kneeling during the national anthem, Bennett decided to sit down ― with law enforcement and community leaders in Seattle to learn about what he could constructively do to help answer questions about race. This is why it’s surprising to see how Bennett has drawn the ire of prominent sports journalists, including ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith, as well as a local sports columnist. It’s unfair that his name was dragged through the mud. Bennett is a unique person and by all accounts a great person ― and he has done nothing wrong. In an article published two weeks ago in The Seattle Times, Matt Calkins heavily criticized the Seattle Seahawks star defensive end for lashing out at a local TV reporter who was questioning him after a game. Calkins didn’t contact the TV reporter before publishing his column. If he had, he would have found out Bennett had privately apologized to him. Calkins penned an apology when he realized his mistake ― but the damage was done. Bennett, who plays one of the league’s most violent positions, is one of its most gentle and caring people. The former undrafted free agent is a highly dedicated member of the community and one of the team’s most respected members. “Mike is a special person because he won’t let anyone change his opinion on what really matters,” Avril told me via text. “He will speak his mind no matter what! A lot of times athletes are afraid to voice their opinion because they want to be ‘politically correct.’ He wants to show that he’s human just like the next but won’t change who he is because he’s a professional athlete!” “I love the heck out of him,” Seahawks coach Pete Carroll told me during the season. “Terrific team player.” Bennett ― whose family foundation helps prevent childhood obesity ― has told me several times that it saddens him to see children suffering. That’s why he goes to the detention centers and why he speaks “with” the troubled youth, not “at” them, he says.  In March, the 31-year-old Bennett announced that he would donate 100 percent of his endorsements to helping minority communities and empowering women of color. Additionally, he will also donate half of his jersey sales to inner-city garden projects. “I was inspired by Chance the Rapper to ‘think bigger’ when he pledged one million dollars to Chicago kids and their school system,” Bennett said in a statement, according to ESPN. “So, I’ll be joining him by investing in the future of our youth. The system is failing our kids, and it will be up to the community and our leaders to help keep the hope alive by focusing on improving our education system and the future of our kids.” Professional athletes are under a social microscope. We expect them to make great plays and help “our teams” win games. But we also turn on them easily for things we perceive as mistakes. After Bennett supported the Seahawks’ potential signing of quarterback Colin Kaepernick, ESPN pundit Stephen A. Smith torched him for it. But Bennett didn’t remain idle. “I know by responding to you I’m just making your job easier by giving you something else to yell about tomorrow, but you are spreading so much ignorance that it’s hard to be silent,” he wrote on Instagram. “You tell us we don’t know anything, but we stand alongside people who have dedicated their lives to try and make change. We’re stepping out on our platform to make a real, substantial impact, while you play the clown.” Richard Sherman, the four-time All-Pro cornerback of the Seahawks ― and someone who is also making a great impact in the community ― believes in Bennett and his conviction, even when it’s not the popular stance. “Mike is a man of integrity,” Sherman tells me via text. “He doesn’t need to put up a front or manifest anything. He is incredibly sharp and informed. The respect that he has from his teammates and coaches stems from how hard he works and what he stands for. As a man. As a father. As a teammate. As a brother. As a friend. He gives everything he has.” Justin Tuck is a two-time Super Bowl champion, former All-Pro and like Sherman, a close friend of Bennett’s. He understands the significance of his friend’s message, even if it’s not always the most popular approach. “Recently I’ve had opportunities to see how passionate he is about change,” Tuck told HuffPost. “I think a lot of times he’s misunderstood because he’s brash in the way he goes about it. He’s also very educated and understands the impact he can have because of his platform. I think he’s utilizing it well.” “Athletes sometimes do the popular thing,” Tuck added. “Mike understands these issues.” Bennett’s honesty and conviction might scare people, but sports fans ― even those who disagree with his opinions ― should be promoting it. What matters is that Bennett doesn’t merely have an opinion, but he believes in it strongly enough to stand up for himself. “I love the city of Seattle,” Bennett told me via text. “I will continue to be an outstanding member and do it organically. But if that makes me unliked I will still do it. I want to change the game on and off the field.” Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com, ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report. ",he,’s,platform
"By Ankur Banerjee (Reuters) - U.S. health insurer Cigna Corp <CI.N> said on Thursday it would buy pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co <ESRX.O> for about $54 billion, the latest deal in the sector aimed at tackling soaring healthcare costs. The move follows the $69 billion merger of insurer Aetna Inc <AET.N> and drugstore chain CVS Health Corp <CVS.N> announced last December, and highlights a sector-wide trend toward deals between companies that do not have directly overlapping operations. The deals seek to lower healthcare costs by bringing under one roof pharmacy and medical claims, and give the combined entities greater leverage in price negotiations with drugmakers. Cigna’s offer consists of $48.75 in cash and 0.2434 shares of stock of the combined company for each Express Scripts share, amounting to $96.03 per share. That represents a premium of nearly 31 percent to Express Scripts’ Wednesday closing price. Express Scripts shares were up 18.6 percent at $87.10, while Cigna shares were down 4.25 percent at $186. The transaction is valued at $67 billion, including about $15 billion in Express Scripts’ debt, the company said. Pharmacy benefit managers administer prescription drug programs for health insurers, self-insured companies and government agencies, negotiating deals with drug manufacturers, working with pharmacies and processing claims. The CVS-Aetna deal was seen pressuring rival insurers, drugmakers, PBMs and retail pharmacies to consider mergers or switching partners to try to keep up with the potential healthcare cost savings or increase in profit margins. The wave of consolidation in the sector also comes in the backdrop of a shifting landscape, including changes in the U.S. Affordable Care Act, rising drug prices and the threat of competition from Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O>. Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said the deal may surprise investors given Cigna has said that they are satisfied with their PBM arrangement with UnitedHealth’s <UNH.N> Optum unit. “It is possible that the threat of an Amazon entry into the healthcare and possibly the drug supply chain landscape, with the latest news of the Amazon/Berkshire Hathaway/JPMorgan employer coalition has spurred Cigna and Express Scripts to tie the knot.” Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway Inc <BRKa.N> and JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> said in January they would form a company to cut health costs for hundreds of thousands of their employees.   After the deal closes, Cigna shareholders will own about 64 percent of the combined company and Express Scripts shareholders the rest. Cigna intends to fund the cash portion of the deal through a combination of cash on hand, Express Scripts debt and new debt issuance. The company is expected to have debt of about $41.1 billion after the deal closes. The insurer said it obtained fully committed debt financing from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd for the deal. The combined company will be led by current Cigna Chief Executive Officer David Cordani. The deal comes a year after Cigna’s deal to buy Anthem Inc <ANTM.N> was blocked by antitrust regulators. Morgan Stanley was the financial adviser to Cigna and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz was the legal adviser. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP is providing regulatory counsel. Centerview Partners and Lazard Frères were financial advisers to Express Scripts, with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP serving as legal counsel and Holland & Knight LLP as regulatory counsel.

"The sheer brilliance of Golden State’s offense is undeniable. No team recorded a better offensive efficiency rating, scored more points or dominated the fast-break more than the Warriors all year. When you have a quartet like Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson, it certainly makes sense. Meanwhile, Golden State’s defensive excellence has been well-documented, but is perhaps not fully understood. How the team goes about it is just as impressive. The Warriors don’t simply guard teams ― they overwhelm them; suffocate them, even.  To hamstring an NBA opponent is a tall task. It requires all five players’ commitment. It also requires versatility, and that’s where the Dubs separate themselves. How many guys can switch ball screens? How many wing players can guard the low post? How many can protect the rim? Interchangeable pieces and versatility are crucial. In the Warriors’ first-round series against the Portland Trail Blazers, we saw Head Coach Steve Kerr employ a hybrid lineup. Remember the so-called “death lineup” last year? With Durant’s rare 1-through-5 defensive ability, this is a modified version of that, only even more effective. Green, Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Ian Clark and David West blitzed Portland, coaxing the Blazers into a 1-12 stretch with four turnovers to start the fourth quarter. What had been a close, hard-fought battle turned into a double-digit victory. This happened once again in Golden State’s Game 1 victory over the Utah Jazz. The quintet started the fourth and blitzed the Jazz with a 10-0 run that essentially sealed the game ― a game in which the Dubs connected on just 24 percent of their threes.  Through their eight games this postseason ― all wins ― the Warriors have amassed a postseason best 96.9 defensive rating that’s nearly four points better than any other team’s. They have also outscored opponents by 16.5 points per game, one of the best marks ever compiled. Interim Head Coach Mike Brown, who is filling in for the injured Kerr, keeps a simple approach: “Defensively, let’s be locked in and try to limit the mistakes,” he said after his club’s 121-95 victory in Game 4 to close out the Jazz. Green is the linchpin of it all. The 27-year-old ― who will soon earn his third straight First-Team All-NBA Defense selection ― isn’t so much a stopper as he is a finely tuned Swiss army knife. He blocks shots, drives point guards insane, and as always, sets the tone as only he can. “Draymond was amazing,” Kerr said after a 121-109 Game 1 win over the Blazers. “He made some tremendous defensive plays. He made threes. He rebounded the ball. He had nine assists. He played a game that I’m not sure anyone else in the league is capable [of], honestly. He’s so unique, and so important to us. He’s phenomenal.” Green’s unique ability was once again on display during Game 1 of a second-round series versus the Jazz. Not only did he check All-Star wing Gordon Hayward; he also guarded the red-hot Joe Johnson and even 7-foot-1-inch center Rudy Gobert. Hayward and Johnson ― the team’s top two offensive threats in the playoffs ― combined for a measly 23 points on 8-25 shooting in the loss. With Green as dominant defensively as he’s ever been, the real boon to the Warriors has been Durant. He’s not only one of the truly great scorers in league history, but also one of today’s most versatile defensive weapons. At 7 feet tall, he's a legitimate rim protector even though he’s often guarding wings. His length and dexterity allow him to cover different types of players. This year, he averaged a career-best 1.6 blocks per game while holding opponents to 44.8 percent shooting, per NBA.com. Additionally, he ranked sixth in the league in defensive win shares (Green was first), ahead of known lockdown defenders like Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler and Andre Roberson. “Very unusual defensive player,” Ron Adams ― the Warriors’ defensive guru ― told The Mercury News in February. “He’s a great helper, very good at making passes difficult. ... He’s added a lot to our defensive scheme.” Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com, ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.  ",Green,blitzed,quarter
"A sixth woman has come forward to complain about sexual discrimination at Monster Energy, a male-dominated beverage company that appears to be plagued by a toxic work culture.  The woman, Karen Simmons, a 50-year-old former sales representative based in Alabama, spent nearly two years with Monster. She amassed a strong track record, even as she fended off one of her Atlanta-based managers, Ted Cook, who hit on her, made comments about her breasts, tried to get her drunk and invited her more than once for an “evening nightcap” in his hotel room on work trips, she told HuffPost.  Robert Duck, Simmons’ direct boss who works out of Monster’s office in Florida, also witnessed Cook’s behavior, but told her to brush it off, she said. “He said Ted was harmless, ‘a dirty old man,’” Simmons recalled.  Through a company spokesman, Duck said Simmons never complained. When reached by phone by HuffPost, he hung up. He did not respond to follow-up texts. Cook also did not respond to a call, text or LinkedIn message.  Simmons took her complaints no further. “What was I gonna say? I loved my job. I needed my job,” she said.  Simmons had worked for about 20 years in the beverage industry, a notoriously unfriendly business for women. “I knew saying things gets you retaliation.” What Simmons did not realize was that whether or not she spoke up, she was already trapped inside a company where the odds are stacked against women.   Last April, Simmons was fired for reasons she still doesn’t quite understand. Monster says it was for poor performance, according to a spokesman for the company. Simmons says her dismissal occurred a few months after receiving a generally positive performance review and just as she was poised to win an internal sales contest. In the fall, she filed sex and age discrimination charges against Monster at the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Monster is also facing lawsuits from five other women over complaints of sexual discrimination and other issues, as first reported in a HuffPost investigation in January. One Monster executive, head of music marketing Brent Hamilton, is facing felony assault charges for allegedly strangling his girlfriend on a company business trip. He is still employed by the company. Another executive, John Kenneally, a vice president accused of sexually harassing two women at the company, resigned after HuffPost published details of the accusations in January. He ran the business unit that Simmons worked in. In public statements at the time, the company painted the women as disgruntled employees and said that the suits were unrelated.  “Monster Energy has zero-tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind,” the company said in January. “Monster takes all reported complaints very seriously. Any suggestions to the contrary are false.” Just as HuffPost was set to publish this story, Monster announced it was hiring a third party to review its human resource policies and procedures. The investigators will report straight to the company’s board of directors. “We are confident that the recent portrayal of the company in the media is not representative of [our] culture and practices,” Monster chairman and CEO Rodney Sacks and vice chair and president Hilton Schlosberg said in a statement. But they added that “in the context of the allegations made by the women bringing these lawsuits, we believe it is prudent.” The company declined to provide more details on the third party. “If there are areas where there are deficients, we will correct them,” Sacks and Schlosberg said. In a statement to HuffPost earlier in March, Monster said it wasn’t aware of Simmons’ complaints until recently.   “Ms. Simmons did not make any allegation of harassment to the company or to her manager while she was employed by the company,” the statement said. Monster only learned of the claim at a mediation session with Simmons and her lawyer in mid-February, the statement said. This was about three weeks after HuffPost published its investigation, the statement points out. Monster also said that Cook is no longer with the company. Simmons’ former boss Duck, who she said witnessed Cook’s behavior, is still working at Monster.   Through a spokesman, Monster also told HuffPost that Simmons’ account was “not accurate.” Simmons’ last employee evaluation included significant feedback about areas for improvement, the spokesman said. It was not positive. In response to other questions and requests for information, the spokesman wrote: “Many of the other allegations or questions are untrue, are missing facts or are irrelevant but we are not going to engage in a back and forth about this.”  After reading HuffPost’s reports, and looking into the cases filed against Monster, Simmons was shocked to learn that another female employee at the company, Page Zeringue, had gone to the human resources department to complain about Cook ― well before Simmons started working under him.  In a lawsuit against Monster, Zeringue alleges that her complaint to HR helped trigger her firing, ostensibly for bad performance. Meanwhile, Cook was sent to sexual harassment training, according to internal documents viewed by HuffPost. This was around the same time Simmons was hired.   Monster Energy markets its drinks primarily to men using cliched tropes about masculinity. Scantily clad Monster Girls in leather bikini tops serve as brand ambassadors. One beverage is actually called “Assault.” A few years ago, the company gave out Monster branded condoms as a promotional gimmick. That toxic male culture translates into policy where sexual harassment is not taken seriously. Monster’s employee guidelines ― reviewed by HuffPost  ― require that managers who observe sexual misconduct must report it. But in Simmons’ case, it appears that her direct boss, Duck, never informed HR about Cook’s conduct.   Even if HR learns about misbehavior, what passes for an investigation into sexual harassment complaints seems to amount to a surface questioning of the parties involved, where the accounts of men are weighed more seriously.   At Monster, terminations may be helped along by a confusing performance review process where managers are allowed to add damaging comments into evaluations, months after employees read their reviews, according to documents reviewed by HuffPost.  Even in an industry known for being heavily male, Monster stands out ― particularly in the sales division where Simmons worked.    Overall, only 13 percent of the company’s 505-person U.S. sales team are women. If you include administrative assistants, the percentage rises to 18 percent female, according to an internal employee directory from January obtained by HuffPost. None of the company’s 11 vice-presidents in sales are women.  Monster said some of the numbers HuffPost obtained were incorrect, but declined to offer specifics or provide its own data. In an earlier statement to HuffPost the company said “many women hold top leadership positions within Monster,” and pointed to its chief commercialization officer, Emelie Tirre. Still, sales is so male-dominated at Monster that at a 2016 national sales meeting in Las Vegas ― even with human resource representatives in attendance ― a vice-president told a blatantly misogynistic joke to a packed room, according to three separate accounts from current and former employees.  The joke goes like this: There is an old bull and a young bull on a hill, overlooking a field of cows. Young bull says to the old bull: “Let’s run down there and fuck a cow.” Old bull says, nah: “Let’s walk down there and fuck them all.” It was meant to inspire. Simmons recalls being appalled. But she was used to hearing sexist talk from male colleagues. After all, she had spent most of her career in beverage sales, a notoriously sexist culture. She knew how to handle herself.  Over the past three years, at least four other women in the east division, where Simmons worked, were fired or pushed out. They include Simmons, two other women who are suing the company for sex discrimination, and one who declined to speak on the record with HuffPost but has since quit. As of January 2018, there were only 16 women out of 153 employees working in the east division. Simmons was often the only woman at the dinners and events where she would meet up with Cook and Duck. Given the company’s cultural penchant for partying, drinking alcohol at these meet-ups was a given.  She didn’t drink, and repeatedly rebuffed Cook’s efforts to “get her drunk,” she said. She declined his invitations for a “nightcap” in his hotel room.  “The more Ted drank, the more handsy he got,” Simmons told HuffPost. On one occasion when he asked for a hug, Simmons said she uncomfortably gave him a half-hug. He wasn’t satisfied, and pulled her in for a do-over, she said. “He said, ’I felt that,” Simmons said, meaning he could feel the pressure of her breasts on his chest.   Arguably, Simmons should never have had to deal with Cook in the first place. Two years earlier Zeringue had filed her complaint about him with the human resources department, according to the lawsuit she filed last year against the company. Huffpost obtained Zeringue’s original complaint to HR. In it she said Cook had a reputation for getting grabby when he drinks, and was known as “Touchy Ted” around the office. She detailed an incident where he talked to her about her breasts and those of a coworker; he also pulled the hugging-close move on her, she said. The HR department reached out to Cook’s boss, Kenneally, the executive who recently resigned in the face of harassment allegations after HuffPost’s investigation published. Kenneally defended Cook, telling the HR representative he had already spoken with him about the incident and there were “no noted recurrences,” according to a review of an internal HR report obtained by HuffPost. Kenneally also made a point of criticizing Zeringue. Her “performance is not where it needs to be,” he is quoted as saying.  When Cook was confronted by HR, he confessed and said “he learned his lesson,” according to internal notes. He also conceded that “touchy Ted” was one of the nicknames he was known by inside the company, another being “Uncle Ted.” He was assigned to sexual harassment training, called “stop sexual harassment training for supervisors,” and given a warning. It’s unclear if HR ever planned any kind of followup to make sure he stayed on track. Zeringue was fired a month later. In her complaint against Monster she claims her firing amounted to retaliation for speaking up. That suit is now headed to private arbitration ― outside the public court system. It was around this time, at a dinner in New Orleans that Simmons attended with Cook, Duck and several other male Monster employees that she said she heard them joking about “having to go to HR classes,” if they misbehaved. “It was just like a big joke,” Simmons said Simmons’ last few months at Monster played out like a corporate gaslighting.  In February 2017, less than two months after she had received a decent performance review from Duck, he asked to meet up with her in Florida where they had both traveled for business.  What happened next came as a total shock. Duck showed her a disciplinary write-up.  “For stuff I didn’t do,” Simmons said. The writeup ― which HuffPost has reviewed ―  claimed she was unwilling to leave her hometown for work. Yet, she was in Florida on a business trip at the time she was given the writeup. “I was out of town every week,” she said. The writeup also claims that Duck spoke with Simmons in January about these issues. Simmons said the only feedback she got that month came when she downloaded her performance review from the company’s internal website. Monster provided HuffPost with a copy of the document. Dated Dec. 31, the review judges Simmons’ performance as “Meets Standards,” giving her a 2.14 rating out of 4, and was generally upbeat and positive but is peppered with constructive criticism.  “At this point the only thing I can ask Karen to improve on is slowing down,” Duck wrote. “She also needs a little more work on time management.”  He called her a “great problem solver,” who sometimes needs help prioritizing, “I have asked her to make sure when she schedules a meeting...to ALWAYS make sure she can do it…” In the category of “job knowledge and skill,” Duck gave Simmons a rating of 3 or “exceeds expectations.” So the negative writeup baffled Simmons.  She cried.  “Where is this coming from?” she asked him. She wanted to understand what she did wrong, so she could fix things. He refused to provide more details. “He said I was making things worse and to go home and forget about it,” Simmons said. For about a month-and-a-half after that, Duck, still Simmons’ direct supervisor, did not talk to Simmons. She said he wouldn’t respond to texts or calls. One thing he apparently did do: update Simmons’ Dec. 31 performance review ― topping the document off with an extremely harsh “summary paragraph” slamming her for poor performance.  The added paragraph is dated March 3, 2017. The tone of this text is vastly different from the rest of the document. “At this point, Karen has lost the trust of some of her bottlers and needs to ‘fix’ this soon or she will struggle,” Duck wrote. “Karen acts disconnected in meetings and face to face with her Coke partners.” Duck used gender-coded words like “abrasive” and “demanding” to describe her demeanor with outside contacts at Coca-Cola bottlers Simmons worked with. The final comment was meant to assess Simmons’ work from the end of December through March, a Monster spokesman told HuffPost. “The final comments reflect not only her manager’s assessment of her work through 12/31/17,” he said. “But the final comment on 03/03/17 was also influenced by her performance in the months after 12/31/17 and before the final comment.” Simmons said she had not seen this paragraph until she was asked about it by HuffPost.  Monster, which provided HuffPost with the review, claimed that Simmons had likely seen the additional paragraph. However, Monster could not provide evidence that she did. According to Monster’s records, Simmons signed her review on March 1 ― two days before Duck signed off on the harsh additional paragraph.  Finally, in late April, Duck broke the silence. He called Simmons and said he needed to meet in person. But when he met her in a hotel lobby in her hometown of Daphne, Alabama, he was there with Cook and they had an HR representative on the phone to talk to her.  She was fired. “It was like somebody just punched me in the stomach,” Simmons said. She cried and begged, she said, telling them she needed the insurance and that her family would suffer. She was offered two weeks severance ― if she signed a document promising not to sue. “I didn’t sign. I just think it was wrong. It was totally wrong,” she said. “Two weeks pay for what they did is wrong.” Zeringue  ― the woman who had complained about Cook years earlier ― also was offered two weeks severance when she was fired. She declined, too. Interestingly, Cook retired less than a month later. It’s unclear why. His colleagues threw him a going away party.  And just a few months later, during Christmas time in 2017, Cook returned to Monster’s Atlanta office dressed up as Santa Claus. Young women at the office sat in his lap and posed for pictures. One woman posted a shot on Facebook captioned #UncleTed.  Simmons, meanwhile, took her dismissal hard. She was so embarrassed about being fired that she stopped leaving her home during the day, not wanting anyone in her small Alabama hometown to ask her why she wasn’t working. “The first six months were awful,” she said. “If I needed to go out, I’d go at three or four in the morning or ten or 11 at night.” Because she lost her job, Simmons’ husband, a 68-year-old who supervises utility crews in Tampa, has had to put off his retirement. He had relocated to Tampa temporarily to make a little extra cash before finishing his career. Now it’s unclear when he can come home.   “This has affected my marriage, my life. It’s been really tough on my family,” she said, breaking down in tears. Simmons is responsible for paying college tuition for her 21-year-old daughter. “My daughter worries all the time. I told her don’t worry about it; we’ll figure a way around it.” Do you have a story to tell about sexual harassment or discrimination at Monster or another workplace?

"By Carolyn Jones Since Donald Trump was elected president, more than 100 California school districts have declared themselves ""sanctuaries"" or ""safe havens"" for undocumented immigrant children. As the debate over immigration heats up, more districts are expected to follow suit. But do these resolutions have much impact? Do they really protect students, or are they just a rhetorical band-aid? And are these districts risking federal funding? Here are some answers. What does it mean when a district calls itself a “safe haven” or a “sanctuary” district? Some elected school boards have declared their districts “safe havens” or “sanctuaries,” which means they offer protections and create a welcoming environment for students and families who are undocumented immigrants. Definitions of “sanctuary” vary from district to district, but in most cases it means that school staff will not allow federal immigration agents on campus without a warrant, subpoena or court order. Any request by immigration agents to enter a campus, or obtain information about students, would have to be approved by the superintendent or the school district's legal staff. In addition, many districts won’t collect immigration information from students when they enroll. Some districts also work with local legal aid and social service nonprofits to help immigrant families facing deportation, and otherwise try to create a welcoming atmosphere for students by promoting tolerance and inclusion. In declaring themselves “sanctuaries,” school boards often cite a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Plyler vs. Doe, which states that school districts cannot deny students an education based on their immigration status. As Oakland Unified notes on its website, “We stand behind our students no matter where they were born or the barriers they have overcome to be here. We cherish the cultural richness in our district and make no exceptions when it comes to including learners with a wide variety of backgrounds and needs.” Under a federal policy, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents are prohibited from making arrests at ""sensitive locations,"" which include schools, churches, hospitals and protest rallies, except under circumstances they consider urgent or with permission from a site supervisor, according to the ICE website. Is there a different between a district calling itself a ""safe haven"" or a ""sanctuary"" district? No. Some districts opted for the labels ""safe haven"" or ""safe zone"" as a way to potentially avoid the Trump Administration's threats against sanctuary jurisdictions. But in most cases the resolutions offer the same protections. Does a school or district run the risk of having federal funds cut off if it passes a safe haven or sanctuary resolution? It's too soon to know. The Trump Administration has threatened to withhold federal grants from local governments — including schools, possibly — that declare themselves “sanctuaries.” But in April, a federal judge ruled in favor of two California counties (San Francisco and Santa Clara) that had sued the president over the order, claiming that the White House does not have the authority to force local police to carry out federal immigration laws. The Trump Administration appealed the ruling. In May, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo saying that sanctuary jurisdictions would only lose grants from the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security, not the federal government generally. Schools in California rely on federal funds for special education, free and reduced-price lunches, teacher training and other expenses. Federal funds account for about 10 percent of the total California spends on public K-12 education. But school police departments are eligible for, and often receive grants from the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security. Sessions left the door open to further changes in his crackdown on sanctuary jurisdictions, however. ""Nothing in the Executive Order limits the Department's ability to point out ways that state and local jurisdictions are undermining our lawful system of immigration or to take enforcement action where state or local practices violate federal laws, regulations, or grant conditions. ... Going forward, the Department, where authorized, may seek to tailor grants to promote a lawful system of immigration,"" he wrote in the memo. What is the main purpose of passing a resolution? School officials say that fear of deportation has led some immigrant families to keep their children home from school. Schools’ budgets are based on average daily attendance, so the fewer students, the less money. Districts have also said that the anti-immigrant rhetoric coming from Washington has led some children to feel anxious or worried, which affects their school performance. Resolutions are intended to reassure students and their families that schools will offer welcoming environments, will not seek or pass on information about students' or parents' immigration status to law enforcement authorities, and will do what they can to keep immigration authorities off school campuses. About 6 percent of California’s population are undocumented immigrants, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. An estimated 12.3 percent of California’s K-12 school children have at least one undocumented parent, according to the Pew Research Center. How many districts in California have passed such resolutions?  Have any faced retaliation or legal consequences as a result of passing them? As of June, 113 school districts and county offices of education,with enrollments totaling 2.7 million students, have declared themselves sanctuaries or safe havens, according to the California Department of Education. Some, such as San Francisco Unified, have been sanctuary districts for more than a decade, but most others adopted the term since the November 2016 election. Most of the state’s largest school districts are on the list, including Los Angeles Unified, Long Beach Unified, San Diego Unified, San Francisco Unified, Fresno Unified, Sacramento Unified, San Jose Unified and Stockton Unified. In addition, the University of California, California State University and California Community College systems have also declared themselves sanctuaries. Those schools represent an additional 1.2 million students. None of California’s sanctuary or safe haven districts have been subject to lawsuits or other backlash, according to the American Civil Liberties Union and California Department of Education What if a district doesn’t want to call itself a “sanctuary” or “safe haven” district?  Can they still pass similar resolutions without using those labels?  Yes. Long Beach Unified, for example, passed a resolution that uses neither term. Instead, the resolution simply states that the district affirms “its protection of students regardless of immigration status.” But like sanctuaries and safe havens, the district promises not to cooperate with federal immigration agents without a warrant. Some districts avoid the term “sanctuary” — opting instead for “safe haven” — because of the Trump Administration’s threats to withhold funding for sanctuaries. In any case, the definition of “sanctuary” has been in flux. In his Jan. 25 executive order on immigration, President Donald Trump describes “sanctuary jurisdictions” as those that “willfully violate Federal law in an attempt to shield aliens from removal from the United States. These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our Republic.” The U.S. attorney general will ultimately decide what jurisdiction is a sanctuary, according to the order. Sessions' May memo clarified the definition of “sanctuary” as any jurisdiction that withholds information about an individual’s immigration status from federal agents. Most so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, including schools, avoid that by not collecting immigration data to begin with. Where can I find examples of model resolutions?  State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson cited Sacramento City Unified School District's resolution as a model for other districts to follow: Sacramento City Unified safe haven resolution. Oakland Unified created a sanctuary web page that includes its resolution, referrals to immigrant rights and community groups, and information about immigration law. The information is available in English, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Khmer and Vietnamese. Los Angeles Unified, which has an immigrant population that's among the state's largest, has passed numerous resolutions in support of immigrants, most recently in May. The district also maintains an immigration hotline and web page of resources for immigrant families, in multiple languages. This story originally appeared on EdSource.org",jurisdictions,avoid,data
"UPDATE: Nov. 14 ― Jody Warner, a Texas prosecutor fired after audio of her berating an Uber driver went public, apologized Tuesday for her language on the tape. A tearful Warner told reporters outside the Frank Crowley Courts Building in Dallas that she was sorry for the language she used, according to The Dallas Morning News. Warner claimed she had been on edge and was nervous when the driver took a different route. (The driver claims she requested he alter the route.) “I’m not trying to make any accusations against that driver,” Warner said. “I don’t know his heart.” Warner’s defense attorney Peter Schulte was among the attorneys who joined the former Dallas County assistant district attorney at the press conference and questioned Warner’s “hasty” firing. “What we’re saying in this case is, if people are going to be fired from working for the state of Texas in this office, you’ve got to let us know, what are the ground rules?” Schulte said. PREVIOUSLY:  A Texas prosecutor identified as the woman heard in an audio clip berating an Uber driver has been fired, The Dallas Morning News reports. Driver Shaun Platt, 26, picked up Dallas County Assistant District Attorney Jody Warner, 32, at a bar in Old East Dallas on Friday. During the ride, Warner, who was apparently in an inebriated state, reportedly struck and hurled insults at Platt after he asked her to clarify directions to her residence. Platt stopped the vehicle and asked Warner to get out. When she refused, he called police. “Oh, my God, you’re an idiot. You are a legitimate retard,” a woman, identified as Warner by The Dallas Morning News, can be heard saying on an audio recording Platt posted to Facebook. “I want to go home so badly but you’re so stupid. I want the cops to come so that they can fuck you up, that’s what I want.” When Platt asks her to exit his vehicle, the woman informs him she is a county employee. “Dude, everything’s being reported,” she says. “I’m an assistant district attorney so shut the fuck up.” She then accuses Platt of “kidnapping,” to which he replies, “It’s not kidnapping, ma’am. You’re free to leave.” The woman continues to berate Platt until police arrive on the scene. However, instead of taking her into custody, authorities reportedly gave her a ride home. While Platt told The Dallas Morning News that “my only hope is that she learns from this and she apologizes,” the outlet revealed Monday that Warner had been fired. “Her behavior is contrary to this office’s core principle of integrity, and it will not be tolerated,” District Attorney Faith Johnson told HuffPost via a written statement. Contacted by HuffPost on Monday, a spokesperson for Dallas police said, “We’re still trying to gather information about this case.” Uber told HuffPost they are looking into the incident in question. There’s two sides to every event. I hope the public will wait to know all the facts before making their minds up. Jody is an honorable prosecutor and the Dallas Co DAs office is lucky to have her. @debruijneline @dallasnews https://t.co/7R9fCneXcJ Warner deactivated her Twitter account Monday, the same day former Dallas prosecutor Peter Schulte took to her defense. “There’s two sides to every event,” Schulte tweeted. “I hope the public will wait to know all the facts before making their minds up.

"Robert Putnam, in his seminal synthesis Bowling Alone, recalls the first two thirds of the 20th century, when ""a powerful tide bore Americans into ever deeper engagement in the life of their communities.""  In Our Kids, Putnam describes the 20th-century boom that produced increases in both absolute and relative socioeconomic mobility. The rich, the poor, and the middle class all benefited from the prosperity driven by industrial growth. The rising tide of the manufacturing economy raised all boats, and often it raised the dinghies sailed by the poor more than it raised the yachts. Bowling Alone focused on the few decades preceding the 1990s, when ""silently, without warning -- that tide [toward deeper engagement in community life] reversed and we were overtaken by a treacherous rip current.""  Our Kids grounds the decline in the social capital of America's poor in the decline of economic opportunity.  It starts with Putnam's hometown in Ottawa County, Ohio, where the industrial economy and economic mobility started to tremble and decline in the 1970s. Ottawa County illustrates the devastation wrought by deindustrialization throughout the nation. Well-paying jobs started to disappear in the 1970s, and by 2012 real wages were down by an average of 16 percent. This spurred a population decline and placed extreme stresses on families and communities. The rise of single-parent families made it more difficult to prepare young children for the education necessary in the post-industrial, global economy, and schools were not able to address the adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) endured by children during hard times.      Putnam recognizes that Bowling Alone could be read as a part of the ""declensionist"" tradition, and he warns against interpreting his work as ""simple nostalgia."" He writes,  The fifties and sixties were hardly a ""golden age,"" especially for those Americans who were marginalized because of their race or gender or social class or sexual orientation. Segregation, by race legally and by gender socially, was the norm, and intolerance, though declining, was still disturbingly high. But he makes the case that the self-assurance that comes with a sense of belonging helped in the battle against racism, sexism, and intolerance. He observes: We were a ""can do"" people, who accomplished whatever we set out to do. We had licked the Depression, turned the tide in World War II, and rebuilt Europe after the war. ... Freedom Summer was an audacious undertaking consistent with the exaggerated sense of importance and potency shared by the privileged members of America's postwar generation. Moreover, Bowling Alone foreshadows a key theme in Our Kids by noting that ""a well-connected individual in a poorly connected society is not as productive as a well-connected individual in a well-connected society."" Putnam expands on this theme by documenting the divisive nature of the self-segregation of the last two decades. One passage in Bowling Alone resonates for me because it recalled the special event when my elementary-school principal took us to the junior high to watch a documentary. The real reason we need school, he added, was that in the future the work week would be 20 hours or less. We needed a great education so that we could get the most out of new opportunities and be the most creative and fulfilled in our free time.  Putnam cites a 1958 University of Chicago study that ""fretted that 'the most dangerous threat hanging over American society is the threat of leisure,' a startling claim in the decade in which the Soviets got the bomb."" Six years later Life magazine ran the headline ""The task ahead: how to take life easy."" Regardless of the tasks we face, Putnam's comprehensive analyses stand as a reminder that there are no simple standalone solutions to complex, interrelated problems. Whether we are tackling problems with schools, families, health outcomes, or communities and social capital, quick and easy shortcuts won't work. Being an inner-city teacher, I especially appreciate his discussion of the problems and solutions for high-poverty schools. I doubt that Putnam fully realizes how appreciative teachers are of his efforts to shift our toxic education debates to a conversation about the real problem, the opportunity gap. To close the racial and economic achievement gaps, we must regain the confidence required to tackle out-of-school issues as well as in-school issues. We must start with high-quality early education, as we end the narrowing of the curriculum to testable subjects and restore extracurricular activities. We must address entire school cultures in an effort to recruit and retain teaching talent in high-challenge schools. While Putnam acknowledges the political challenges associated with socioeconomic integration, it and full-service community schools are necessary. Putnam goes out of his way to avoid the blame game as he lists constructive, humane, evidence-based solutions. As Nicholas Lemann says in an excellent New York Review of Books review, Our Kids could have focused on the ""1 percent"" and the rise of corporate power documented by Thomas Piketty. Instead, he wrote a different book that contrasted the gains of the upper one third of Americans with the declines of the bottom third. We need both -- Piketty's documentation of the damage done by corporate elites and Putnam's nonjudgmental approach. The question of how much strife will be necessary to correct the growth of inequities will be determined by how the elites respond.  Putnam briefly explains how the standard competition-driven, test-driven education-reform solutions are misguided, but he doesn't dwell on recriminations. I hope that we educators, who have been so abused by corporate school reform, will be equally charitable and open to Putnam's pragmatic and constructive approach. Our students need more loving adults in their lives. We need a team effort to teach them self-control and responsibility (regardless of whether we use the word ""grit"").  And, of course, our kids need better-paying jobs. Neither schools nor great scholarship like Putnam's can close the opportunity gap. But America has tackled worse problems. Both a new set of education policies and Our Kids can help generate the conversations that will be necessary to get our democracy back on track.",we,needed,time

Every day is Earth Day, folks, as I was reminded by these late summer wildflowers I photographed a few days ago.  Making the U.S. a global clean energy leader will ensure a heck of a lot more jobs, and a clean, safe future. If you'd like to join the increasing numbers of people who want to TELL Congress that they will vote for clean energy candidates you can do so here. It's our way of letting Congress know there's a strong clean energy voting bloc out there.

"  ""All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.""  - George Orwell -  You are being programmed right now.  Every pixel, every sound byte, every limbic social media post - they're all intended to nudge you a little closer to the extreme end of one of the poles (or polls). This current election season is by far the most polarizing of any that I've witnessed in my lifetime.  Though the candidates both stand for very definitive things (as they should) it's the human bullhorns sounding poll-tested-vitriol that are doing the damage, luring millions with the seductive bug lights of party rhetoric. When did our republic become so shallow that we just started blindly following political parties?  In a nutshell, that's what we're being told to do during this election cycle, even if we're unaware of it. We hear it daily: ""You may not like how candidate X stands on issue Y, but in the end, his/her party stands for Z, so just go along with the party on this one. Everything will be okay in long run."" Really? It will? How so? Does the end always justify the means? Humanity isn't that simple, nor is it that simpleminded.  There's much more to this election than the stances of a political party.  Don't get me wrong, there are issues, and they matter- immigration, borders, foreign policy, a woman's right to choose, etc., but these aren't just issues for issue's sake. There are human lives attached to every one of these things.  Have we forgotten that we live in a country that was built on championing the wellbeing of individuals, not the ideology of a particular party?  When we are considering a candidate for presidential office, are we backing the candidate who envisions a country that works for everyone? John Lynch once said,  ""We will not agree on every issue. But let us respect those differences and respect one another. Let us recognize that we do not serve an ideology or a political party; we serve the people."" - John Lynch -  That rings true. I'm told that when trying to get any kind of livestock to behave like one wants, that it's much easier to employ threats to keep them in line (be it electrified fences, cattle prods, sheepdogs, communal cages, or shock collars).  It's alarming to me that this is exactly how I see the ""party ranchers"" of the current political climate getting the herds to behave like they want them to. They employ threats, pique fears, and we respond just like cattle. We funnel into the gates of the slaughterhouse, completely unaware of what lies ahead of us because we are so afraid of what is pushing us from behind. America is better than that.  You are better than that. You are more than a member of a political party. Black, white, gay, straight, transgendered, rich, poor, Muslim, Christian, Agnostic, Atheist, pick your label- you are an individual. You are a valued (and valid) member of the American family.  Are you voting for the candidate who cares about the entire family? Your neighbors? Your friends? The business owner down the street from your house? The church, mosque, or temple across town? The children that your kids hang out with? Their parents? Those living on the margins of society who don't have what you have because they weren't as lucky as you were? Does your candidate have their good in mind? Answer those questions honestly, and this foggy political landscape becomes much more easy to navigate. Selah.",Everything,be,run

Luminor 4-13, 2014, 88 x 78 in. The backstory leading up to the jaw-droppingly beautiful exhibition of new paintings by Stanley Casselman at Brintz Galleries in Palm Beach presents fascinating and engaging clues from the evolutionary road that the artist has traveled since his attraction to manipulating clay as a college student at Pitzer in Claremont, California. The artist's ""Red Sea parting"" moment came while majoring in economics, through the advice of his ceramics professor, David Furman, who persuaded Casselman that he had the natural ability and insight to become a painter and that he should take a painting class. It's a story that has many interesting parallels to those of hugely successful artists like Dale Chihuly, who started out as a textile major, which eventually led him to weaving glass together,and later, creatively expanding molten glass into translucent sculpture; or the billboard painter James Rosenquist, who carried his sometimes dangerous professional experiences from a one-man balancing act on scaffolding high in the air into his downtown Manhattan studio to become a stalwart of Pop Art by appropriating advertising pictures into his compositions. Likewise, Andy Warhol, whose exclusive source material also was borrowed imagery, parlayed his childhood fascination with movie stars into controversial silkscreen paintings that were created by pulling a squeegee across a blank canvas. It also needs to be noted that Roy Lichtenstein first worked as a commercial artist and window dresser, where he cultivated a fascination with cartoons and everyday objects that he captured in his artwork by an idiosyncratic abstraction painted through stencils, and for a time closely resembled Warhol's early paintings. Resemblances in styles and influences then and now are an acceptable and frequently celebrated reality in picture-making, where artists deliberately overlap with each other, often inseparably like the early experimental Cubist works of Picasso and Braque, which for years were identical as they continued to break down compositional conventions, and preceded the ultimate reuse of the printed page with the invention of collage. At some point, however, they went their separate ways.
IR 38 10, 30 x 30 in. Permanent Collection of Colorado Springs Museum. In Casselman's case, the familiarity with textures, coupled with the thick, tactile, earthy nature of clay that he manipulated with rubber and metal-edged ""ribs,"" naturally and eventually carried over to his unique approach to painting, which he has been exploring for over twenty-five years.  While in college, he used those ribs, essentially mini-squeegees, to define, mold or uncover hidden layers -- techniques that he continues to use on a much bigger scale today, as he methodically spreads paint across a tightly-stretched canvas. Through years of trial and error and always with his myriad of custom-built squeegees, Stanley Casselman has carefully crafted his personal iconic surfaces that began to get results and draw critical attention.

Then, as luck would have it, after a work by Gerhard Richter sold at auction for a staggering $34.2 million, along came a challenge on Facebook proposed by Jerry Saltz, eminent art critic for New York magazine, which challenged artists to produce a painting in a perfect Richteresque-style for just $155, and Saltz would come for a studio visit. The thought of having one of Manhattan's most important critics visit Casselman's studio seemed too good for him to pass up, yet he was quite conflicted about the idea of copying Richter, or anyone, for that matter.  However, caution to the wind, he set out to decode Richter's language.  Encouraged by the ongoing explosive experiments and the promising results in his studio, Casselman knew he had something and indeed he succeeded.  Saltz visited and got his painting; $155 changed hands; but Jerry was so taken by what Casselman had created that he decided to write a feature story about it in New York magazine.


Stanley Casselman working in his studio. The best part of this historic tale is that in Casselman's paintings -- what led him here aside -- he's created a novel syntax that doesn't exist in Richter's repertoire. His recent small and large-scale works have been well received and seem to go well beyond Richter's standard fare. In addition, Casselman has perfected a delightful surface consisting of the unique practice of meticulously applying thick and thin paint, then pulling a squeegee across the canvas surface both vertically and horizontally, resulting in brilliant colors flowing and merging together to form a cohesive visual statement. Casselman, like an architect, plans well ahead to construct a strong, painterly foundation, which allows him to explore an adventuresome journey that ultimately provides structure, density, layering, fluidity, harmonic movement, spatial illusion and rich texture with a propensity for producing truly powerful works of art.
Brintz Galleries Installation  I'm reminded of the remarkable similarities between Casselman's background and serendipitous ""luck of the draw"" and that of acclaimed artist Harold Shapinsky, whose ""discovery"" was the subject of a lengthy feature article in The New Yorker in 1985. Shapinsky was a young man when he began painting abstract expressionist-based works in total obscurity, which he continued refining every day for over thirty years before he was noticed by accident. He had studied briefly with de Kooning and Motherwell, and then he diligently built a hybrid style that was associated closely with de Kooning's; in fact, Shapinsky's work often was misinterpreted as that of de Kooning. But curators and critics, including Kenworth Moffett, former director of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, argued that Shapinsky perhaps was more original, and questioned ""who came first?"" His first exhibition in America was at my Palm Beach gallery, which nearly sold out, and included a painting that was purchased by Henry Ford. Next for Shapinsky was an acquisition by the National Gallery in Washington, D.C., and other museums, and finally an auction at Sotheby's, with the final sale amount ten times that of the original gallery price.
Luminor 4-24, 2014, 61 x 49 in. Permanent Collection of Coral Springs Museum of Art. In a way, Casselman was indirectly ""discovered"" when he took on a challenge that coincidentally pushed him forward and into the spotlight. Like Shapinsky, he was influenced by a universally recognized artist, but also like Shapinsky, he developed an engaging style of his own making through painstaking investigation that is now paying off both critically and financially. Museums are beginning to collect his work; shows are selling out in New York, California and London; reviews are coming in from The New York Times, Forbes, The Wall Street Journal and New York magazine; as well as a recent Phillips auction with one of his works bringing a stellar price. It's a pretty astonishing connection between these two artists.
Luminor 1-7, 2014, 79 x 63 in. Even without the amazing backstory or the arm's-length attachments; appropriations aside, and with subtle coincidences and other obscure references to Rothko, Frankenthaler, Joan Mitchell, and others; these works offer a remarkable singularity of character, resourcefulness and a confidence of spirit that is refreshing, stimulating and striking all at once. Casselman offers an impressive, revealing visual parallel to a geologist's study of the layers of the earth's surface as moved by a force of nature or gravity, full of revelation and knowledge.

"This thread runs through many reformster ideas and many of my responses to them. I just wanted to gather thoughts about betterocracy in one place. Many reformsters have one fundamental point in common: They don't really believe in democracy. They believe in betterocracy. Betterocracy rests on one simple fundamental belief: Some people really are better than others. It's not necessarily the possession of a particular quality, though Betters are usually smarter, wiser, and possessed of superior character. It's that Betters are made of the right stuff. They come from good stock. They are just better than others. This is not a new thing. Back in the earlier days of romance and story, we find tales of princes who were reduced to tatters and penury, but whose Inner Quality always shone through, and they always rose to their proper princely place. Our Puritan forefathers believed that God had chosen certain people, and you would be able to spot the Chosen because God would reward them for being Better. Horatio Alger made a career out of penning stories of young men possessed of fine character and plucky grit, whose innate superiority eventually lifted them to the level of society to which they truly belonged.  Some folks interpret the idea of American Democracy to be, ""All humans are equal."" But other folks believe that promise is, ""Any human can turn out to be a Better."" We have always had signifiers of Betterness. In the bad old days, those signs that you might be a better included  traits such as Being White or Having a Penis. More progressive bettercrats have come to understand that such signifiers are unreliable, but when they talk about opening the tent to folks of all race, gender and religion, it's not that they believe that all Black Muslim women are equal to white Christian guys. They just mean they are open to the possibility that a Black Muslim woman could turn out to be a Better, too. In fact, many bettercrats are delighted to find non-white, non-wealthy, or non-men who are Betters because it proves we really do live in an enlightened and liberal age. But they still don't believe in democracy, and they still believe that some people are better than others. Non-believers in betterocracy often imagine that Betters are simply greedhounds in pursuit of stuff and money and power and prestige just to have those things. I don't believe that's true. Bettercrats like those things because they are signfiers of Quality. They are proof that the Betters really are Better. The money, the prestige, the stuff -- why would they have all of that unless they were Better? The right schools, the right clubs, the right houses in the right neighborhoods -- these are all proof that they really are Better. Bettercrats can actually be dismissive of the stuff. After all, they have the stuff because they deserve it, and so if fate somehow burned down the house and rabble took the money, the Betters would still get it back. They deserve it, and as long as the universe is functioning properly, the Betters will not be denied their due. Failure is a temporary glitch and only happens on a real or permanent scale to Lessers. Betters can come in all political stripes, defined mostly by disagreements about what the signifiers of Betterness actually are. Conservative vs. liberal bettercrats mostly argue whether anyone who's not white and penis-deprived can be a Better (mostly no), and how to treat the Lessers. Because a bettercratic country has to be organized in strata. We must sort and stack, because Betters and Lessers should be subject to different regulations, different laws, different punishments, and, of course, different educational systems. Betters can be allowed to roam free, and while they may need to get an occasional course-correction or wake-up call, we know they're The Right Kind of People. Lessers, however, have all sorts of Naughty Tendencies and we must do what we can to hold their Lesser natures in check. So a Better who is, say, busted for drugs, shouldn't have to suffer the rest of his life for a youthful indiscretion, but a Lesser who is busted needs to be taught a lesson without mercy. Betters should be cut some slack, but if you give a Lesser an inch, he'll take a mile. Betters occasionally need a hand or some help, and that's only right. Betters owe it to other Betters to lend a hand, and of course Betters deserve every bit of help they get. But Lessers are always looking for a handout, and to give them help is just to encourage their dependent, lazy, lesser nature. Betters who have had a hard moment or two need understanding and support, but Lessers should be allowed No Excuses. Bettercrats are in a tizzy these days because we have a problem as a country -- too many portions of the government have been taken over by Lessers, who in turn are pandering to large groups of Special Interest Lessers. This is Very Bad, because unchecked, Lessers will do Terrible, Bad Things. In fact, they might demand money and power and other trappings of success to which they are not entitled (though Better's will use the word ""entitled"" to mean ""thinking they deserve things that they do not deserve). They don't seem to understand that the fact they need help proves that they don't deserve help. Bettercrats expect Lessers to know their place. After all, they wouldn't be poor and powerless if that wasn't what they deserved. After all, the nicer word for betterocracy is ""meritocracy,"" the system in which people get what they deserve -- and not everybody deserves the best. If they deserved it, they would have it. Trying to give it to them is just violating the natural order. So we need different education systems -- one to prepare Betters for lives of well-deserved privilege, money and power, and another to prepare Lessers for their proper role in society. Better schools are for providing opportunities and enrichment for America's future leaders. Lesser schools are for training America's future employees. In addition, in the dreams of liberal-minded bettercrats, the system should also provide a means of discovering and rescuing Betters who are, by some accident of birth and zip code, trapped amongst the Lessers. This rescue mission makes bettercrats feel more progressive. But, again -- progressive bettercrats do not believe that all humans are created equal; they believe that individuals from almost any background could turn out to be Betters (but only if rescued from the influence of Lessers). And if the two-tier system is set up and managed in such a way that it reverse the regrettable trend of giving Lessers too much control, too much power, too much say -- well, that's a bonus. Bettercrats know that not everybody should have a say. Betters should be in charge. Lessers should not. Letting just anybody have a vote, even if he's a Lesser, leads to bad, messy, stupid decisions. Better to sweep away voting rights (from electing Presidents to choosing school boards) in predominantly Lesser communities. Dump the school board, and install leadership by a Better. Do not engage or discuss with the members of the community; if they deserved to have money, power,or a say, they would already have it. Bettercrats sometimes succumb to anger -- why don't these Lessers see that their schools suck, their children are ignorant, their neighborhoods are holes, and that their communities are awash in unworthy Lessers. Some of them don't even have the decency to feel bad about it. Man, if we could just get some solid proof that their world sucks and rub their faces in it until they finally hollered uncle and begged for their Betters to come straighten everything out for them. But some of them just keep acting like they deserve to have a voice, like they have a right to love their lives and their families and their communities. The bottom line is that bettercrats believe that democracy is, really, a bad idea. Some people just don't deserve to have a say. Some people just don't deserve to be in charge of anything. Some people just aren't important. Some people just don't matter. Some people just can't have nice things. Bettercrats may, out of generosity and a general sense of noblesse oblige, give Lessers the nice things that they don't deserve, but those will be nice things that the Betters have selected, and Lessers can have the nice things under terms dictated by the Betters. Why shouldn't Betters have an outsized disproportionate influence on government? The fact that they have the money and power to wield influence is proof that they are right to do so. None of this is democracy, not even a watered-down republic-styled democracy. Bettercrats mostly would not recognize democracy (they most commonly call it ""socialism""). And that's why we've got the refomster programs that we have. Our Betters are trying to give the Lessers the system they deserve while rescuing Betters who have been trapped by zip codes in dens of Lesser iniquity. Our Betters are creating a system that disenfranchises Lessers (who, after all, do not deserve to be enfranchised in the first place because if they deserved to have power, they would have it). Our Betters are trying to create a system that further reinforces their own power and control, because they deserve to have them. Our Betters are even trying to get Lessers to understand that they are, in fact, Lessers. The genius of America is that of a country that makes room for all voices and treats them all as equals, tied together and forced to create systems that accommodate all our citizens. It envisions a level playing field in which all voices and ideas can compete in the grand marketplace of thought. We have never fully lived up to that genius, but Betters do not even recognize it as genius to begin with. Right now their lack of vision is bad for education, but in the long run, it's bad for the entire country. Originally posted at Curmudgucation.",Betters,have,government
"The State Department is making a big mistake in putting off a decision on the appointment of a Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat anti-Semitism. In order to continue fighting the rise in global anti-Semitism, it is critical that our government allocate the appropriate resources, and that begins with the key appointment to fill the role of special envoy. In recent testimony before Congress, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the administration has not yet made a decision about whether to fill the position. Under questioning, Secretary Tillerson’s response was notably vague. While he recognized statutory requirements to do so, he also indicated that officials in the administration “have not made a decision about this particular special envoy” and suggested that they were taking a pause, “until we know this is the best way to deliver.” We are joining with former Special Envoys Ira Forman and Hannah Rosenthal to urge the Secretary of State to commit to continuing this important office, and have just launched a public petition encouraging Americans to join us in mobilizing support to fill the position as quickly as possible. We know firsthand from working intimately with every prior envoy who had served in this very important role the tremendously positive and meaningful outcomes that have been accomplished through diplomacy. Not only is it the law of the land, signed into law by former President George W. Bush, but it has bipartisan congressional support, a rare thing these days. It would send a forceful message to governments and Jewish communities globally that America will continue to lead on matters of human and civil rights as it has for the last seven decades. Moreover, there is broad public support, both within and outside of the Jewish community, for the position to be filled. America has led the way in responding to anti-Semitism in the 21st century: Pressuring the OSCE to organize conferences on anti-Semitism in Europe; working with the international community to promote Holocaust education; and speaking out against violence toward Jews and refused to accept rationalizations that it was all about the Middle East conflict and not Jew-hatred. The establishment of this special envoy position within the U.S. State Department whose sole mandate was to monitor the state of anti-Semitism around the world and to formulate approaches to counter that phenomenon was remarkable. This was classic American leadership at work. To some degree it was modeled on the breakthrough human rights reports first developed by the State Department in the 1960s under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. These reports were compiled through American embassies around the world which were required to submit findings on how human rights were observed in their particular countries. The report became the most awaited annual human rights document, even taking into account some criticisms of its reportage. Similarly, with the introduction of the special envoy position, informally at least, it was expected that American embassies would monitor anti-Semitism in the countries they resided in. Three factors came together and were catalysts for this new position when it was first created in 2004 via the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act. They remain relevant at a time when there is ambiguity as to whether the Trump Administration will sustain it: First was the fact that America had the deserved reputation as the world’s superpower, leading not only by virtue of its military and economic strength but by projecting democratic values. Second, there was the recognition that when Jews were most imperiled, during the Nazi regime of terror, the world and even the United States did not do what had to be done. And third was an understanding that anti-Semitism was not just a history lesson but a current event, that attacks against Jews in Europe and elsewhere were now becoming more frequent and acceptable decades after the Holocaust. In the ensuing years, the threats to Jews around the world have not diminished and, if anything, they are seen as increasing in certain countries. France, Hungary, and Venezuela are among the many places where Jews have been ― and continue to be ― targeted. As the three previous envoys have noted, the office has been an important vehicle to ensure conversation on and attention to anti-Semitism. When specific issues arise, such as in Hungary, when the government was considering erecting a statue of a collaborator with the Nazis, the intervention of the special envoy can be critical. The interactions between the envoy and Jewish community representatives around the world lend an immeasurable element of moral and psychological support to those communities. For us, it seems like a no-brainer: Not a single day goes by when we see new manifestations of the world’s oldest hatred around the world. America’s voice is desperately needed now.",We,joining,position
"The first time I was sexually assaulted, I was 11. It was on a train, and nearly every member of my immediate and extended family was there when it happened. In particular, every male figure in my family. It didn’t make a difference. On that train ride most of my family was standing, and I sat next to a man who was the only person in the cart who wasn’t related to us. He was a stranger, though he was coincidentally Vietnamese as well. I had a large box on my lap that covered my legs and within a few short minutes, felt fingers rubbing the sides of my left leg. It was gentle, subtle enough to make me even wonder if it was really happening. It was definitely happening. This man was rubbing the leg of an 11-year-old child, right in front of her family. I said nothing. I did nothing. I was frozen. When the train got to the man’s stop, he stood up, said goodbye in Vietnamese with a tip of his hat to my family, and went on with his day. My guess is he never thought of me again. I, of course, have never ever forgotten him. One of the men in my family looked over to me and asked if the man had been touching me. My face flushed and I couldn’t bring myself to speak. I nodded silently. I didn’t know anyone had seen it, and I wondered why, if someone had, they didn’t stop it. The person who asked me if I was touched said they weren’t sure if it was actually happening, so they didn’t say anything. My uncles and cousins went berserk. They said to me, “Why didn’t you say something?! We would have beaten the shit out of him ― he wouldn’t be walking right now!” Everyone other than me talked heatedly about what happened until the end of ride: What they would and could have done, what I should have done... a bunch of hypotheticals that wouldn’t have stopped the incident or made it any better. I remained silent. My mother came over to me, grabbed my face and said, “Don’t you ever let anyone touch you like that. And if anyone ever does, TELL ME. I’ll kill them.” I nodded, still not saying a word. Even the steadfast strength of my mother couldn’t make me feel at ease. We got back home and I retreated to a room alone, where I burst into unstoppable tears. And the worst part about my tears was that even today, I’m not sure if I was crying over the assault itself or the feeling of embarrassment and shame I felt when I was chastised for not saying anything. I was mortified, scared, confused, and blamed myself for it all. After all, I was the one who didn’t even know if I was being touched, and I was the one who let it happen without a peep. It was my fault. There was a number of things wrong with this scenario. You could take your pick of any part of the story and you’d end up in the same place: It’s entirely fucked up. I do not know if what happened and my reaction as a child was the result of an inherently quiet Vietnamese culture or an American culture of silence on sexual abuse, but I know the combination of the two led to a worst-case scenario: A child was abused and she said nothing. So both cultures cannot continue as they are. Not if other children are to be protected. I wish I could continue this story to say that from then on I never stayed silent. But to do so would be a brazen lie. Instead, I have gone on to experience numerous sexual assaults and countless scenarios of sexual harassment, all worse as I got older, and all about which I have said and done nothing. Until now. I’m changing the story as a write this. I’m saying something. I speak up today to stand with all women who have been sexually harassed, abused, exploited, and denigrated. I speak up to stand with all the women who are part of the #MeToo movement right now and always, who will no longer accept silence as the norm. I speak up for the women who don’t have the privilege of a platform, like I do. I speak up for the men who want to be allies but who have been complicit in the silent assaults and harassment of girls and women. It’s time for you to speak up with us, too. It’s time for you to condemn the inappropriate, inexcusable, non-consensual sexual acts of abuse committed by your fellow men. It’s time to start believing women when they speak up. It’s time for the benefit of the doubt and empathy to belong to the victim, and never again to the perpetrator. It never should have taken multiple women to come forward until someone believed them about Bill Cosby, Harvey Weinstein, and any other man in power who exploits and abuses their position. The only way to enact change is to do it together as allies who say, “This is not, nor will it ever be, okay.” It’s our responsibility to speak for the women who will still stay silent for whatever their reasons and we owe it to the young girls who should feel safely empowered enough to come forward when it happens to them. They should never be warned of the repercussions of speaking truth to power. They should only be encouraged to speak, even if it takes them a long time to do it. We can’t wonder why women take so long to come forward if doing so will mean they’ll have to face as much scrutiny as their abuser. We can’t ever tell them that their time to speak is limited, so that when they find the strength to, they can tell their story with impunity. Women who are stepping out of the shadows to tell their stories are starting a brave, bold movement. It’s a movement of sisterhood, and it’s a request for help from male allies, because the truth is, we absolutely cannot do it alone, nor do we deserve to. It’s a movement for future generations of girls who we hope won’t ever feel the need to retreat and cry their tears alone in shame. It’s a movement to stop the silence surrounding sexual abuse and to take it even one step further, which is even to halt abuse entirely. The tides are shifting, and we won’t drown in our stories anymore. Instead our stories will be our buoys, and we will all survive by speaking them out loud. #MeToo, women... I am with you.",me,make,ease
"WASHINGTON, April 30 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has postponed the imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada, the European Union and Mexico until June 1, and has reached agreements for permanent exemptions for Argentina, Australia and Brazil, the White House said on Monday. The decisions came just hours before temporary exemptions from the tariffs on these countries were set to expire at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday. In a statement, the White House said the details of the deals with Brazil, Argentina and Australia would be finalized shortly, and it did not disclose terms. “The administration is also extending negotiations with Canada, Mexico, and the European Union for a final 30 days. In all of these negotiations, the administration is focused on quotas that will restrain imports, prevent transshipment, and protect the national security,” the White House added. A source familiar with the decision said there would be no further extensions beyond June 1 to stave off tariffs. Trump on March 23 imposed a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum, but granted temporary exemptions to Canada, Mexico, Brazil, the EU, Australia and Argentina. Trump has also granted a permanent exemption on steel tariffs to South Korea as part of a revision of a free trade pact that he sharply criticized. Trump has invoked a 1962 trade law to erect protections for U.S. steel and aluminum producers on national security grounds, amid a worldwide glut of both metals that is largely blamed on excess production in China. The tariffs, which have increased frictions with U.S. trading partners worldwide and have prompted several challenges before the World Trade Organization, are aimed at allowing the two U.S. metals industries to increase their capacity utilization rates above 80 percent for the first time in years. Trump administration officials have said that in lieu of tariffs, steel- and aluminum-exporting countries would have to agree to quotas designed to achieve similar protections for U.S. producers. Australia’s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and the country’s Trade Minister Steven Ciobo welcomed the tariff exemption, and said the country would continue to work with Washington to prevent dumping. “The exemption reflects the fair and reciprocal trade relationship Australia shares with the United States and underpins the unbreakable friendship between our two great nations,” they said in a statement. Australia’s sole steel producer Bluescope, which supplies locally made steel to its own factories in the United States, said it was pleased with the exemption. “Now it’s time to refocus, and get back to business,” Managing Director Mark Vassella said in a statement. South Korea earned its permanent exemption from steel tariffs by agreeing to quotas that will cut its steel shipments by about 30 percent from 2017 levels. Seoul is still subject to U.S. aluminum tariffs Most Asian markets were closed for a holiday on Tuesday but on the London Metal Exchange, aluminum and steel-linked materials eased on prospects supply could be cheaper to come by. The White House said the agreements reflect administration efforts “to reach fair outcomes with allies to protect our national security and address global challenges to the steel and aluminum industries.” Todd Leebow, president of Majestic Steel USA, a Cleveland-based distributor of domestic steel products, said American steelmakers needed certainty that import protections won’t be eroded. “We’re hopeful this extension moves us toward the most productive path for our domestic steel industry - the tariffs President Trump announced earlier this year and a quota system to limit the amount of imports flooding our country,” Leebow said in a statement. The metals tariffs have caused some divisions within Trump’s Republican Party, with steel- and aluminum-consuming industries warning higher prices would hurt their competitiveness. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, a pro-trade Republican from Texas, said he would work to ensure the tariffs “are narrow and targeted to protect our workers and job creators here at home.” But Canada, Mexico and the European Union have all insisted they will not accept quotas to gain permanent exemptions from the U.S. tariffs. The European Commission said the extension of the temporary exemption prolonged market uncertainty, which was already affecting business decisions. “The EU should be fully and permanently exempted from these measures, as they cannot be justified on the grounds of national security,” it said in a statement. A British government spokeswoman in Washington said the extension for the EU was “positive,” but the UK steel and aluminum industries needed safeguarding. “We remain concerned about the impact of these tariffs on global trade and will continue to work with the EU on a multilateral solution to the global problem of overcapacity, as well as to manage the impact on domestic markets.” Negotiations over U.S. steel and aluminum tariff exemptions for Canada and Mexico have also become intertwined with intensified talks to reach an agreement to update the North American Free Trade Agreement. Canada is the largest steel exporter to the United States, and its industry is highly integrated with that of its southern neighbor, with raw materials and finished steel crisscrossing the Great Lakes region. Any move by the United States to impose tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum would be a “very bad idea” guaranteed to disrupt trade between the two countries, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday. If the EU is subject to tariffs on the 6.4 billion euros ($7.7 billion) of the metals it exports annually to the United States, it has said it will set its own duties on 2.8 billion euros of U.S. exports of products ranging from makeup to motorcycles.",Negotiations,intertwined,Agreement
"We don’t need another example to know what’s up. Cam Newton, NFL star with the Carolina Panthers, had just recently disrespected a female journalist by mocking her in a press conference. Lisa Pearson, CEO of Umbel Corp., a data management platform for sports organizations, was not completely surprised at the expression of gender disparity and the tone of dismissiveness. “Certainly there are enough examples to pull from,” says Pearson, “as the pace of change is so staggeringly poor, it takes my breath away.” But it does not take away her mission and certainly not the impetus to move forward for women in tech and in sports management. Her eye is on the future, one that has gender parity. One of the reasons Pearson is so hopeful is her 13-year-old daughter, Eloise. Her daughter explained to her mother recently that on the school playground, some boys in her class made a rude comment. “And these girls turned around and roared,” Pearson says. And then they went to their teacher to propose a student-led conference with the theme, “Objectifying Women and Believing in Feminism.” The future is bright in part because of this next generation, she says. Because the bias, discrimination and invisibility of women in the workplace have gone on long enough. “All the industries I have been in have been male-led: agency side, global consumer brands, B2B software, without a lot of commonalties, except they are very male-oriented,” says Pearson, who also heads Umbelita’s, the company’s women’s leadership group. At Umbel since August 2015, as chief marketing officer, Pearson moved up to president in 2016, and became its CEO in April 2017. Pearson’s extensive experience in marketing spans representation of a variety of brands and corporations including Johnson & Johnson, TLC (The Learning Channel), Yahoo! HotJobs and American Eagle. The Texas-based CEO has also led her own strategic consultancy firm and served as principal in leading marketing agencies including DeVries Global and Euro RSCG where she helped drive strategy and performance for companies including Dell, IBM, Johnson & Johnson, American Express, Procter & Gamble, Starbucks, Stolinchnaya, ABSOLUT Spirits Company, Heineken Fetzer Winery, Champagne Krug, Champagne Perrier Jouet and Champagne G.H. Mumm. She has witnessed and experienced gender bias for decades. Working through her first pregnancy earlier in her career, Pearson says, “I never acknowledged I was having a baby. And when I came back from having a baby, I did not put up photos.” She adds, “I cannot believe such a beautiful milestone was something I felt no one even noticed.” The main lesson Pearson learned and wants to pass on is, “Stop hiding being a woman.” Pearson says the culture of the workplaces she was in early in her career promoted “the idea that you should be less womanly and blend in with the men to be successful.” She adds what is needed instead is “pushing for cultural shifts against sameness.” Others in sports leadership and management agree that sameness needs to be disrupted. At the recent espnW.com Summit, Laura Gentile, senior vice president, ESPNW and Women’s Initiatives, said, “The reality is that cultural and societal issues collide with sports all the time so I think we’ve really tried to handle it with great professionalism and maturity. To focus on how it affects the sports world and how it is affecting women in sports, specifically,” Gentile said,  according to The Wrap. Pearson’s company mission for Umbel is to engage fans and improve the data management of sports brands and clients. That mission is connected to understanding female fans—a demographic that many do not understand accurately. Stacey Pope,  Associate Professor in School of Applied Social Sciences at Durham University, researches the nature of female fans. She writes in The Conversation,  “When it comes to sports, die-hard fans are often thought of as the men in the crowd. But my new research shows, that despite popular stereotypes of women lacking sporting knowledge or only being interested in the sexual attractiveness of (male) star players – female fans are just as passionate and committed to their clubs as the men.” The gender bias is pervasive in sports management as well. “The sports world is often a difficult one for women to thrive in, as women often have to battle against people minimizing their work and expertise,” writes Bee Quammie in HuffPost. The sports and tech universes need to move to parity, as it will help the bottom line in both spheres. Stacey Leasca writes in Mic, “Women control 70-80 percent of all consumer purchasing through what Forbes described as a combination of ‘buying power and influence.’ This means even if a woman doesn’t directly purchase an item she influences the person who does.” The power and influence of women customers is only one part of prioritizing a shift to gender equity.  Changing workplace culture is essential. [bctt tweet=“Changing workplace culture is essential to prioritizing a shift to #genderequity” username=“takeleadwomen”] Those cultural shifts can be accomplished with direct strategies to reduce unconscious bias, Pearson says, and she has specific recommendations on how to make that happen. Act as a mentor. As a woman, “what are you doing to make the company more hospitable to women?” Pearson asks. Enlist male support. Ask male leaders to be mentors to women and ask men to speak out in order to change the work climate. Change job descriptions. “Communicating high risk aptitude using language  like ninja, rockstar, aggressive was resonant for male employees so female candidates would feel this job wasn’t them,” Pearson says Avoid referral bias. Having mostly male employees would result in mostly young male candidates. So reward referrals outside of a network. Make sure the leadership team is 50 percent female. “From a candidate’s perspective, if I go on the , leadership page and do not see women there, I feel I don’t want to work there,” Pearson says. Be aware this is not a lady problem. The lack of gender parity in leadership in sports, tech and beyond is “a systemic, cultural problem and men should take this seriously,” Pearson says. Conduct a salary audit. “I wanted to make sure women are paid the same,” Perason says. “It’s not perfect, but I made corrections.” Be honest and authentic in service of the collective good. “Believing in something philosophically and prioritizing it are very different things,” Pearson says. “You can say it and say and say it about companies doing ridiculously better with more women CEOS and women on boards. But people are not relating to it, because if they were, it would look different.” Be more visible. “Get other women leaders out there to show what is possible. We need to show there are women executives who are happy and thriving,” Pearson says. “You can’t be what you can’t see.” Pearson is willing to be persistent in her goal to push for gender equity not just in tech and sports, but everywhere. “I am willing to be tedious and annoying in talking about” gender parity, Pearson says. “Women need to be willing to talk more freely, push the issues, be an example to other women and hold men who care on principle to accountability.” She adds, “It will take a combination of stick and carrot. We have to bring consequences. If a client doesn’t see diversity on the board and a tech company loses a big contract. Then it will change.” This post originally ran in Take The Lead.",Pearson,says,it
"In high spirits after having dinner in London with old friends that I hadn’t seen for a long time, I jumped off the Tube at Bond Street Station, waved goodbye to my friend Poli and made my way back to the hotel where I was staying. The bellhop held open the heavy wooden doors and I stepped inside the lobby. It was just past midnight but the hotel was empty, and the clip-clopping of my heels on the marble floor echoed throughout the building. Deep in thought, I made it halfway up the carpeted stairs when I realised that someone was following me and shouting in my direction. Alarmed, I turned around and was met with a Concierge who squared up in front of me as if to assert his authority. “Are you a guest at this hotel Madam? If so, I’ll need to see your room card. If you’re joining someone, can you please tell me his name and room number? We can’t have unregistered guests staying at the hotel” Taken aback, I didn’t really handle the situation the way that I wish I had. “Erm yes, yes I am” I stuttered as I fumbled around in my handbag trying to find my door pass among the clutter while he stood watching impatiently as if this “search” was just a front to save face. I retrieved the door pass from a sea of pens, foreign currency and subway ticket stubs, handed it to him for closer inspection and then went on my way, self consciously zipping up my coat as I climbed the rest of the stairs. (For the record, and since I know we live in a society of “victim blaming,”  I was dressed conservatively - a long skirt, a trench coat and heels; though I am a believer of the school of thought that women should be entitled to dress as they please without being victims of ignorance and prejudice). Sitting in my hotel room, my shock soon transformed to fury and as much as I tried to get to sleep, I couldn’t rest thinking about the concierge. I called my friend, I ranted on Twitter, and then eventually, at 3am I threw on my hotel slippers and gown and shuffled to the Reception desk. I explained the situation to the man that greeted me and without an apology, was met with an indifferent response of “Well Ma’am, it really is at the Concierge’s discretion as to who he decides to stop for security reasons”. Bewildered, I shuffled back to my room assuring myself I’d write a strongly worded email of complaint in the morning. (The funny thing about this situation was, I was in town reviewing the hotel as a Travel Writer!)  The situation was humiliating, and not representative of how you expect to be treated as a guest of a luxury hotel; however the worst part about this experience was that this type of thing has happened to me before. Several times actually, though admittedly this was the most confrontational.   There just seems to be something about a woman that takes care of her appearance being by herself in certain locations that rubs people up the wrong way. As though it is completely out of the question that she could be in a luxury hotel by herself as a result of her own successes. As though just because she isn’t donning a backpack and staying in a hostel, she couldn’t possibly be a solo traveller. As though a woman wearing makeup couldn’t possibly have an interest in history, culture, and world issues. As a woman in her late twenties who earns her own money and prefers the comforts of a hotel to the chaos of an eight person backpacker’s hostel dorm, I am no stranger to this ignorance. I have received plenty of lecherous looks from males thinking that I was on sale, and disapproving looks from females about my lack of self-respect.  To feel eyes burning into you, silently judging you because of this untrue and ignorant assumption is probably one of the most humiliating feelings in the world. It knocks your confidence, causes you to be hypercritical of yourself, your appearance, and your surroundings, and almost makes you feel ashamed as if you were actually there soliciting. My experiences are not just restricted to hotel stays. Living in Seoul, white women are somewhat fetishised and to satisfy this “demand” there are plenty of Russian prostitutes on hand. I cannot count the number of times that I have been approached and offered money for sex in Korea. Most of the time, I was dressed in the most unflattering attire and buying groceries or doing the recycling.   I can’t exactly go around with a billboard attached to me that states my accolades and the intricacies of my resume but I wish that people could be open minded about the fact that there are many plausible reasons why a young woman may be sitting in a hotel lounge at 7pm, scribbling on her notepad by herself that don’t involve selling sex.  Obviously not everyone I encounter while travelling alone makes this assumption about me (at least I hope they don’t!), but it’s happened enough that I felt the need to share it. I am a huge ambassador for solo female travel and I strongly believe that every woman should try it at least once in her life. These incidents were in the minority, but maybe my sharing this here will provide some comfort to anyone that has experienced the same (or if they do in the future, and then they don’t have to go through the same “what is it about my appearance?” self-analysing process that I did.)    Melissa Douglas is a full time Travel Writer and Blogger who has been traveling the World solo for 6 years and believes in pushing the boundaries of solo female travel.

"The price of a Russell Wilson game jersey found on one website is about $20. A Broncos infant onesie on the same site sells for around $5.   Too good to be true? Probably.  As Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos fans gear up for Sunday's Super Bowl, it's likely that some will sport -- knowingly or unknowingly -- counterfeit jerseys, jackets, T-shirts and hats that they purchased online or in stores. But it's not just quality and the economy that may be compromised, according to experts. The phony products could also expose wearers to toxic chemicals. ""People may be trying to save a buck, impress their friends, show off their team's colors,"" said Andrew Munoz, a spokesman for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Seattle. ""But a lot of these pieces end up falling apart after one wash. On top of that, there are health concerns."" Federal authorities in New York City, right across the state line from New Jersey where this year's Super Bowl will be played, reported on Thursday that they have seized more than 202,000 imitation NFL items, as well as 163 websites selling knock-offs since Operation Team Player began in June.  Like shipments of tainted children's shoes, jewelry and cosmetics -- the FBI released a warning about the health hazards of counterfeit makeup and fragrances in early January -- some fan products are still believed to have slipped under the radar and across the border. ""Most of these counterfeits are coming from China. We don't know what conditions they are being made in. We don't know what dyes and other chemicals they're using,"" said Munoz, noting seizures of Chinese goods in the past have tested ""high in lead, cadmium and other chemicals used in these types of clothing."" But the confiscated Super Bowl items have not been tested for heavy metals or other toxic chemicals, noted Justin Cole, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman in New York. ""Children's toys are a big concern. But there's been no reason to worry and go down that route [with apparel],"" he said. Scott Wolfson, a spokesperson with the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission, agreed. ""We really haven't seen that as an area where we've actually done any enforcement or seen a need for a public announcement,"" he said. Still, other experts and advocates are taking the risk seriously. ""I don't want to make it overblown,"" said Munoz, ""but the concern is real."" In January, environmental advocacy group Greenpeace reported hazardous chemicals in children's clothes and shoes made by major brands, including Disney, Burberry and Adidas. Even though contaminants still turn up, name brands do have a market incentive to follow regulations and keep toxic chemicals out of their products. In fact, several companies, including Nike, have pledged to eliminate hazardous chemicals from their supply chains by 2020. Counterfeiters, on the other hand, don't have high standards. ""They'll go for the cheapest and easiest, and that tends to be the most toxic compounds out there,"" said John Deans, an analyst for Greenpeace's Toxics Campaign. Still, he cautioned, without testing, there is no way to be sure counterfeit products are more toxic than the major brands. “Part of the problem is that in manufacturing countries like China and Indonesia, there are not many restrictions, so the whole market has the potential to be toxic,” said Deans. Plasticizers such as phthalates, which studies have found can disrupt human hormones, are often used in the synthetic fabrics and in the plastic-like ink used to put names and numbers on jerseys, Deans noted. Lead and cadmium also may be part of the mix. Mounting evidence links exposures to very low levels of lead with brain damage, reproductive disorders, cardiovascular disease and a host of other health problems. The biggest risks are faced by pregnant women and young children. Such dangers were also among those underscored in a consumer guide to fake clothing, published by the Italian Ministry for Economic Development in November 2012. ""It is easy to find traces of chemical coloring agents and paints which are harmful to health,"" reads the report. ""Over time, the chemicals are gradually absorbed by the skin."" Still, the bigger health risks, according to Deans, may come through the manufacturing, care and eventual disposal of the tainted products.  ""When people wash the jersey after the season's over -- because, of course, you can't wash it until the season is over -- phthalates become available in the environment,"" he said.  Whether flowing out with laundry wastewater, or released from a landfill or incinerator, heavy metals and plasticizers can end up in the air, soil or water, and result in new exposure to the public. Cole said that while it's possible some confiscated Super Bowl gear could eventually be donated to charity, most of it would be destroyed. The seizures continue, and new counterfeit merchandise figures to be released next week will surpass the current total of more than $21.6 million, he said. Ultimate victory over the imitators is unlikely. Feds face an ongoing game of whack-a-mole;  while they continually upgrade their fake-finding tools, criminals seem to find new ways to fool them. ""Counterfeiters are getting very good at what they do,"" said Munoz. From slick web designs that mimic authentic NFL stores to the use of the official NFL hologram, both feds and consumers can be easily duped.  ""Everyone knows how much these luxury goods cost. If it looks too good to be true, people should think twice before buying that jersey or T-shirt for their kids or themselves,"" Munoz advised.",he,seen,announcement
"Terrified and powerless. Those are the word that come to mind to describe my childhood experience. For the first 18 years of my life, domestic violence held my family hostage. As the violence unfolded on those dark nights, I tried to console myself in the belief ― one day, I won’t have to live in a world of terror and violence. There is something worse than the actual violence, when you are a child ― it is the pervasive feeling of powerlessness. Domestic violence is a punctuation of my story, but its not the essence of who I am. One of the greatest moments of my life was that instant that recognized my strength, and the inherent power to chose how I would live my life. Folks who have been through something - understand what it means to push through the veil of fear, and discover who we really are, and the depth of our power. Cayla Mills offers us powerful truth “You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have.” So when Mr. Trump presided over the most bizarre press conference I have ever seen, on Thursday, February 16, I saw inflections of a kind violence, I’ve seen before. When asked if he intended to work with members of the CBC (Congressional Black Caucus) by April Ryan, a distinguished African-American journalist, a powerful woman, Mr. Trump’s demeanor visibly changed, as he became viciously irate. In a near threatening tone - he asked Ms. Ryan if “she knew them” (because you know all black people know each other – pardon my sarcasm). He treated her as if she was a minion, asking if she would set up a meeting for him. Black women are accustom to these virulent moments - poised, she checked him with professionalism and declined his assignment. As I was convincing myself to calm the hell down, telling myself throwing my iPad at the television probably wasn’t a good idea, Mr. Trump hurled another insult to someone else. This time it was Jake Turx, who happens to be a Hasidic Jew. Mr. Turx wanted to discuss policy, but 45 abruptly cut him off –- and tangentially launched into a defense of his loyalty to the Jewish community, as though he had been accused of anti-Semitic. Like I said, bizarre. Still, this is not a rant about 45, Mr. Trump. I am wondering what are we going to do as citizens of the USA, as people of every ethnic origin, folks of every gender expression, LGBTQ people, people of every faith tradition and many others; what are we going to do in this moment? In the face of ballistic racism, rising anti-Semitism, xenophobia, sexism, Islamophobia, how are we going to respond in this moment? In the last two weeks, synagogues have received 48 bomb threats. Federal authorities are investigating. We also know incidences of hate crimes have surged since November 9, 2016. No, this moment is not necessarily about 45. This is about us, and the choices we need to make. What kind of world do we want to live in? Do we recoil, with the illusion ― since it’s not happening to us –- we will be okay. When an African-American woman is disrespected in the White House, all of us have been disrespected. When the safety of Jewish communities are in jeopardy, all of us are in jeopardy. When Islamophobia is the new badge for patriotism something has gone terribly wrong. Martin Neimöller’s is yelling at us ― with his poem First They Came….” Believe me when I say, I am no longer the terrified little boy growing up South-Central Los Angeles whose only prayer was to escape violence -– feeling totally powerless. Like many others - who have come through something, I awoke to the reality - that the Creator of all things has endowed me with tremendous power to effect change in my life, my family, community, and beyond - if I choose to access my God-given strength. We have a choice to make. Either we see our commonality, across every community, and take on the complicated and gut-wrenching work of racial justice, and stand against every form of injustice or, we remain silent, and by default, chose the tyranny of hatred. Do we have to wait until it is our daughter, son, partner or loved one that is victimized by hatred’s effect? Protests, demonstrations happening around the world gives me hope. Still, I am convinced we have to do more. Standing against what we refuse to accept through resistance is essential. We also need to commit ourselves to build a new reality for the world we want. The choice is ours. Need help? In the U.S., call 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) for the National Domestic Violence Hotline  .",we,want,world
"Things don't always happen the way one hoped they would. Although people don't look forward to receiving bad news, when it comes a-knocking at their door, many react with an astonishing range of emotions. No matter how much one struggles to avoid accidents and illnesses, life has a strange way of sabotaging happiness. Some men act rashly when blood rushes to the wrong part of their anatomy. Others (like Donald Trump)  remain in furious denial that anything they do and/or say might cause them to suffer serious consequences. Bottom line?  One's actions often have repercussions. Whether misfortune results from bad luck, gullibility, a natural disaster, or a person's innate stupidity, the chance that things won't always go well remains pretty strong. But you already knew that. Didn't you? * * * * * * * * * * Audiences can be easily misled into thinking that the full title of Barry O'Neil's 1913 silent film is When The Earth Trembled. Indeed, the most powerful images from the film and its marketing campaign show residents of San Francisco coping with the traumatic experience of the Great Earthquake of 1906. The film is also thought to be the first piece of cinematic fiction to depict the historic quake.  Poster art for When The Earth Trembled, or The Strength of Love  However, the full title of O'Neil's film (When The Earth Trembled, or The Strength of Love) indicates that there is far more woe in store for the protagonist than a 7.8 earthquake. Shortly after Paul Girard, Jr. (Harry Myers) marries his attorney's daughter, Dora Sims (Ethel Clayton), the elders of both families get into a bitter argument and sever their business relationship. Filled with spite and eager to bring his old friend to ruin, Paul Girard, Sr. (Bartley McCullum) acquires a majority shareholder's interest in the company run by Dora's father. After the young couple moves to San Francisco (along with Dora's father), they suffer a series of severe business setbacks. However, none of the characters in O'Neil's film could have anticipated that, after leaving San Francisco just days prior to the earthquake, Paul would become shipwrecked, Dora's father would die during the quake, and Dora would return to Philadelphia only to discover that the elder Girard was determined to take away her two children (played by Mary Powers and Lathan Miegzler).  Dora Sims returns to Philadelphia with her two children
in When The Earth Trembled, or The Strength of Love  This film -- one of the earliest three-reelers from the silent era --  had been considered lost for many years (largely because, on June 13, 1914, a fire had destroyed all the negatives produced by the Lubin Manufacturing Company since its launch in 1896). However, on March 28, 2015, the EYE Film Institute Netherlands presented the world premiere of a digitally restored version of When The Earth Trembled. EYE used three incomplete prints (its own as well as those supplied by the British Film Institute and New York's Museum of Modern Art) as the source material for the restoration, although some segments of the 43-minute film had sustained serious damage. On May 29, the San Francisco Silent Film Festival presented the American premiere of the long-lost 1913 film. The following clip shows the contrast between sections of the restored print and the quality of the source prints from EYE, MOMA, and the BFI. With Stephen Horne accompanying the film on piano, flute, and accordion, this screening of When The Earth Trembled offered a fascinating perspective on what filmmaking was like more than a century ago -- when computer generated imagery (CGI) was unimaginable. Although the film includes some stock footage taken in San Francisco following the 1906 earthquake, it took O'Neil nearly four months to design and create the special effects that could recreate that horrible day. While introducing the screening, Rob Byrne (the President of the festival's Board of Directors, who worked on the film's restoration) noted how some actors narrowly escaped being severely injured during the earthquake scenes (a chandelier fell on Ethel Clayton as she was trying to escape from a collapsing house).     To the surprise of many in the audience at the Castro Theatre, the San Francisco earthquake was only a small part of this melodramatic narrative. Edwin Barbour's plot crammed a helluva lot of family drama into a three-reeler and kept the audience on the edge of their seats throughout When The Earth Trembled, or The Strength of Love. * * * * * * * * * * Using a unit set designed by Mikiko Uesugi and carefully lit by Kurt Landisman, Josh Costello recently directed the Bay Area premiere of Detroit for the Aurora Theatre Company. Although Detroit received its world premiere from the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago in 2010, was a finalist among the contenders for the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, and won Off-Broadway's 2013 Obie Award for Best New American Play, dramatist Lisa D'Amour claims that her play's title is not a direct reference to Michigan's largest and most important city. ""To me, it's about a particular anxiety the name of that city evokes. Detroit is a symbol to so many people of the American dream drying up. While working on the play, I started hearing about radical grassroots movements in Detroit trying to bring the city back. There's something bubbling up there -- where the structures aren't working and the people are taking over -- that's interesting. It's a weird title, but if you look at the play and how at times it feels like a surreal fable, it makes sense.""  Patrick Kelly Jones, Amy Resnick, Luisa Frasconi, and
Jeff Garrett in a scene from Detroit (Photo by: David Allen)   To my mind, D'Amour's play is much more about the tragic gullibility of well-meaning fools. Mary (Amy Resnick) and Ben (Jeff Garrett) are an affable, lower middle class, well-meaning suburban couple who, after years of a stable but relatively boring life, are experiencing new and unanticipated pressures on their marriage. Perhaps the biggest mystery in their neighborhood is the identity of a woman who goes jogging every day dressed in a hot pink outfit.  Mary (Amy Resnick), Sharon (Luisa Frasconi), Kenny
(Patrick Kelly Jones), and Ben (Jeff Garrett) enjoy some
white trash cuisine in a scene from Detroit (Photo by: David Allen)   Ben and Mary's loneliness is broken by the arrival of Sharon (Luisa Frasconi), the female half of the couple who have moved in next door. At 31, Sharon is fresh out of rehab, working at a local call center, and surviving on a diet that primarily consists of ramen noodles. Since arriving in town, she's noticed a strange lack of any sense of community (like in the old days when a neighbor would drop by and ask to borrow, well, maybe something). Following Mary's invitation to join her and Ben for a back yard barbecue, Sharon arrives with her husband Kenny (Patrick Kelly Jones), who is currently managing a warehouse. As the two couples get to know each other, Ben and Mary learn that Sharon and Kenny met in rehab and have moved into their new home following the death of Kenny's aunt. While they would like to purchase the home, they are surprisingly guarded about many pertinent details involving their lifestyle. Out of sheer pity, Mary gives them a coffee table (that she hates) so that Sharon and Kenny will at least have some furniture in their home.  Kenny (Patrick Kelly Jones) and Ben (Jeff Garrett) enjoy some
male bonding in a scene from Detroit (Photo by: David Allen)   Detroit attempts to capture the trepidation that the universal dream of a suburban lifestyle is rapidly falling through the fingers of people who actually live in suburbia. Since both couples in D'Amour's play are childless -- and seem to have no hobbies or outside interests -- they have few if any friends. As the country hurtles toward an economic crisis, Mary and Ben see their net income rapidly diminishing while it becomes obvious to them that Sharon and Kenny can barely hold onto a job. Things soon take a turn for the worse. Ben injures his leg as a result of Kenny's well-meant but incompetent carpentry work. Sharon has an unnerving confrontation with the lady in the hot pink jogging suit (who accuses her of dumping her dog's shit on the woman's front lawn). As more and more ""puppies"" get thrown onto the grill during successive barbecues, one wonders if these two couples can sustain their fragile friendship.

As their new-found friendship careens out of control, the normally risk-averse Ben and Mary find themselves goaded into dangerous behavior by two failures who have nothing of their own to lose. When a tempting fantasy has tragic consequences, D'Amour's play takes a sudden and chilling change of course.  Ben (Jeff Garrett) and Kenny (Patrick Kelly Jones)
watch the flames rise in Detroit (Photo by: David Allen)   It's not like anyone in the audience couldn't sense that disaster was imminent. But in their naive desire to do good, Ben and Mary play right into the hands of two irresponsible drug addicts who are about as mature as middle schoolers. Sharon is so convinced from the way Ben speaks that he must be British that Ben eventually ends up buying into her fantasy. After having been fired from her job at the call center, when it's Sharon's turn to cater dinner, she describes her culinary style as ""white trash."" The further away the foursome gets from any sense of responsibility, the fainter their grip on reality. After calamity strikes, they are visited by Frank (also played by Patrick Kelly Jones), an elderly man who has lived in the community for decades and waxes nostalgic about an era of suburban intimacy that may never have really existed. Two interesting casting decisions had a strong impact on Aurora's production. Although D'Amour's script describes Ben and Mary as being around 30-32 years old, Amy Resnick and Jeff Garrett give one the impression that the couple is well into their 40s (and perhaps a generation older than Sharon and Kenny). Patrick Kelly Jones also doubles as Kenny and Frank (the elderly neighbor) in this production.  Mary (Amy Resnick) and Ben (Jeff Garrett)

(Photo by: David Allen)   The odd thing about D'Amour's play is that, while it delivers plenty of laughs, it ends up being far more disturbing than the satire it was meant to be. Detroit points to the extreme weakness and/or vulnerability of those who have been so anesthetized by a suburban lifestyle that they can't even recognize signs of imminent danger that are staring them in the face. Aurora's ensemble did a beautiful job of bringing D'Amour's script to life, with special kudos to Amy Resnick and Patrick Kelly Jones. Prior to attending any performance of Detroit, I would strongly advise reading Omid Safi's probing article entitled The Disease of Being Busy.

"You’ll find little in the way of silver linings in Parkland, Florida, this week, where a gunman killed 17 people and injured 15 more at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Nor will you find them in Las Vegas, where a heavily armed gunman opened fire on thousands of concertgoers in October, killing 58 and injuring hundreds more in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Beneath both of these incidents, however, is a harrowing realization that could be momentarily mistaken for the coldest of comfort: As horrific as these shootings were, the evidence suggests they could have been far worse. This is in no way a cause for solace. Rather, it’s a disturbing reminder of the cards we’ve been dealt by feckless lawmakers who have failed to take any action whatsoever to prevent or even mitigate mass shootings. And it should serve as a warning that as long as we continue to do nothing, we are likely resigning ourselves to a fate of mass shootings more horrific than the ones we’ve experienced. The Florida gunman reportedly entered Stoneman Douglas High on Wednesday with a legally purchased AR-15 semiautomatic rifle and “countless magazines,” each one holding 30 rounds. When he opened fire, the school went into an “active shooter” lockdown. Teachers and students barricaded doors and went into hiding. An armed school resource officer was on duty at the time but was unable to respond. By the time the shooting was over, the gunman had fired more than 100 rounds, authorities said. But for reasons we may never know, he appeared to stop shooting on his own accord. “He tried blending into the crowd and was talking to one of my friends as he was exiting,” a student said of the shooter. When police arrested the suspect, a former student, they found a number of loaded magazines in his backpack. On Friday, the FBI reported that it had failed to act after receiving a tip that the young man had expressed a “desire to kill people” and spoke about “the potential of him conducting a school shooting.”  In Las Vegas, the potential for further damage was far greater. The gunman in that shooting appears to have used more than a dozen assault-style rifles in the attack, many of them outfitted with 100-round magazines and bump stocks, after-market accessories that simulate automatic fire. Although fully automatic weapons are illegal under federal law unless specially registered, the gunman’s arsenal was completely legal. According to a subsequent report by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, he “did not commit a crime until he fired the first round into the crowd.” The gunman, shooting from the 32nd floor of a hotel, was ultimately able to fire more than 1,100 rounds into the crowd of helpless people, following a crude plan known as “the beaten zone” in military jargon, said Arthur Alphin, a ballistics expert and former West Point professor who has testified in a number of multiple shooting cases. “This guy didn’t even have any sights on some of his guns. He wasn’t aiming them. He was just pouring bullets into that beaten zone of a couple football fields,” said Alphin. “If anybody thinks that the murdering bastard looked down there, identified a target and said, ‘That’s Sweet Pea from Arkansas. I’m going to shoot her,’ they’re full of it. He couldn’t see them, he couldn’t recognize them.” In the end, the gunman stopped shooting of his own volition before fatally shooting himself. When police finally breached his hotel room, the shooting had been over for more than an hour. Inside, investigators found a dozen additional firearms and more than 5,000 rounds of live ammunition. Based on the gunman’s arsenal, it appears that he could have caused more destruction if he’d been intent on it, Alphin said. “He could have planned it far, far better, absolutely no question,” he said. “He was clearly a lunatic. He clearly knew nothing about his guns. To him, ammo was ammo and guns were guns.” Whatever relief we might feel at hearing that is a telling indictment of our approach to mass shootings. We’ve given people easy access to all the tools they need to inflict unimaginable violence on others, leaving ourselves simply to hope that nobody will use them for that purpose. And when this inevitably fails, we often end up having little choice but to hope that mass shooters will choose to limit their carnage themselves. By taking no action in the face of these increasingly deadly and frequent mass shootings, we now find ourselves in an arrangement in which these death tolls are often limited only by a gunman’s depravity and choice of target. As we’ve found out again and again, there will always be a more heartless person with a more sadistic plot to slaughter innocent people.",gunman,stopped,himself
"WASHINGTON — Sanctions that the Trump administration slapped on a Russian oligarch as part of an effort to punish the country for its hostile behavior in Crimea, Ukraine and Syria likely delayed the delivery of sewage pump equipment to the headquarters of the National Mall last month, forcing National Park Service employees to continue using portable toilets at work.  The Russian in question is Viktor Vekselberg, the billionaire reportedly involved with $500,000 in payments to President Donald Trump’s attorney Michael Cohen.  HuffPost was alerted to toilet troubles at the National Mall and Memorial Parks headquarters last month by an Interior Department employee with knowledge of the situation. The employee said at the time that the agency was working to find a new distributor to obtain a pump after the Russian sanctions held up the original order. Mike Litterst, a spokesman for the National Park Service, confirmed that the historic building, located just east of the Jefferson Memorial, has had ongoing issues with pumps in the building’s sewage pit. The pumps were replaced last summer, but burned out again in March, rendering the restrooms unusable. For weeks, employees had to use portable toilets or facilities in nearby buildings, Litterst said. The difficulties at the National Mall and Memorial Parks headquarters comes as Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is pushing an energy- and infrastructure-focused agenda. He has repeatedly promised to address the ballooning $11.3 billion maintenance backlog at national parks. It appears the restrooms would have been up and running sooner had Sulzer, a Swiss industrial company that specializes in pump equipment, not gotten wrapped up in the Russia sanctions. On April 6, the Treasury Department announced sanctions against seven Russian oligarchs with ties to President Vladimir Putin and 12 companies those individuals control or own. Among those targeted was Vekselberg, the Ukrainian-born owner of Renova Group, an investment company that specializes in metals, energy and chemicals. Until recently, Renova held a majority stake in Sulzer. To obtain new pumps, the National Park Service hired Chesapeake Environmental Equipment, a company based in Forest Hill, Maryland, that distributes Sulzer’s products. An online summary of the $9,468 contract lists the purchase as “Sewage Ejector Pumps For National Mall and Memorial Parks HQ Waste System.” Initially, Litterst told HuffPost that NPS was obtaining parts from two suppliers. He later clarified that the agency only dealt with Chesapeake, which was getting parts from two suppliers. Reached by phone, Chesapeake’s president, Jason North, immediately hung up. He and other company representatives did not respond to numerous subsequent calls and emails seeking comment.  Litterst confirmed that Sulzer manufactures the pumps and system controls the park service received through Chesapeake. Asked specifically if sanctions imposed against Sulzer impacted the contractor’s ability to supply NPS the required parts in any way, Litterst said, “Chesapeake Environmental Equipment provided the equipment we ordered, and did so within the requested time frame.”  He suggested HuffPost contact Chesapeake with questions about the contractor’s suppliers. After learning of the Treasury’s actions against Vekselberg, Sulzer CEO Gregoire Poux-Guillaume “stepped into crisis mode” in order to come up with a plan to limit the impact to the company’s U.S. operations, Bloomberg reported. And on April 12, Sulzer announced that it had acquired 5 million of its shares from Renova in order to make Renova a minority shareholder, thus freeing Sulzer from the sanctions. Sulzer said at the time that its activities “have been considerably disrupted,” but that it “does not believe that its long-term performance will be affected.” Christopher Scott, a U.S.-based attorney for Sulzer, told HuffPost that while the sanctions temporarily froze the company’s assets in the U.S., he could not speak to how exactly it might have impacted its business with Chesapeake. NPS’s contract with Chesapeake is dated March 19, roughly three weeks before Sulzer was ensnared in the sanctions. Litterest said the pump controls were delivered to headquarters on April 13 ― one day after Sulzer freed itself from the penalties. So while the sanctions likely were not the sole reason for a delay, they appear to have further slowed toilet repair at the park service building. The toilets at the headquarters building were back up and running April 20, and the portable toilets were removed from the headquarters parking lot this Tuesday, according to Litterst. In an April 6 release announcing sanctions against Vekselberg and other oligarchs, the Treasury Department noted that in 2016 Russian prosecutors stormed Renova’s offices and arrested two top executives for “bribing officials connected to a power generation project in Russia.” Unrelated, the attorney representing adult film star Stormy Daniels, Michael Avenatti, revealed this week that Trump’s longtime attorney, Michael Cohen, received payments totaling about $500,000 from Columbus Nova, a U.S. affiliate of the Russian billionaire’s company. Special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly interviewed Vekselberg this year both about payments to Trump’s lawyer and as part of the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, according to reports from CNN and The New York Times.",summary,lists,System
"Breaking up may be hard to do, but getting back together is near impossible, though Bill Nighy and Carey Mulligan give it a game try with searing performances in a spirited and caustic revival of Skylight, David Hare's one-night stand of lovers' recriminations. At the time of the play, the early 1990's, Kyra Hollis is living in squalid flat in a housing project from the 60's in the northern London ghetto district of Kensal Rise, teaching kids of welfare parents in a rough and rowdy school in East Ham. It was not always thus for Kyra.  As her story is teased out over the course of one cold and snowy night, she was for six years the live-in mistress of Tom Sergeant, a successful restauranteur, best friends with Tom's unsuspecting wife Alice, and surrogate big sister to his two children, a boy named Edward and his sister. Then one day Alice discovered the affair and Kyra left the next day. The lights come up on Kyra, superbly and subtly played by Mulligan, arriving home from another frustrating day in the classroom with a pile of blue books to grade and a couple of  bags of groceries. To her surprise she is followed in by Edward, now 18, whom she has not seen since she walked out on his dad three years ago. Edward has brought Kyra some beer and several CD's of the new rap music that is becoming so popular, and through a ferocious and strained diatribe against his father, during which it is learned that Alice died a year ago, manages to get out the one question he wants to ask Kyra after all these years: ""Why did you leave?"" Kyra evades it with the aplomb of a politician.  No sooner has she seen Edward out the door than her buzzer frantically rings. This time it is Tom himself, in an intense and energetic performance by Nighy, and he arrives with a bottle of Scotch and a swagger. He has some questions of his own, though he may not like Kyra's answers. Hare is one of the theater's more literate writers and Skylight is almost a staged debate on issues ranging from socio-economics to the welfare state to what was once called the generation gap, and he gives each side its point and counterpoint. The dialogue is brimming with wit and passion and full of clever lines everyone wishes he or she could come up with in the heat of argument. But at the heart of Skylight is the nature of love and the foundation on which it must be built if it is to last.  The structure of the play is like that of a Romantic sonata, scored mainly for cello and violin but with a viola in the first and last movements. Even the direction of this new staging could have musical notations in the margin. Stephen Daldry, the brilliant director who now has two plays running next door to each other on 45th Street (the other being The Audience with Helen Mirren), raises and lowers the tempo from scene to scene - furioso in Nighy's lengthy outbursts to adagio in Mulligan's and Nighy's reminisces. Even the volume ranges from fortissimo to pianissimo as their quarrels wax and wane.  There are some incongruities in Skylight. Tom's daughter, whose bicycle accident provided the catalyst for Kyra joining the family, is hardly mentioned again. It is certainly convenient that Krya has not acquired a boyfriend or even much in the way of friends in the three years since her break-up with Tom, and the timing of Edward's and Tom's visit on the same night is dramatically expedient if not entirely credible. But Daldry's cast makes one forget, or at least overlook, such problems.  Mulligan is in full control of her character from her first entrance, sniffling and blotting her nose from the cold. She is polite but cautious when she finds Edward in her flat, almost nonchalant as she listens to him rant about his dad and her former lover. She is even more circumspect when Tom shows up. In Mulligan's performance it is easy to see why Tom would want Kyra back, and she makes it easy to understand why Kyra finds a vocation in teaching kids who have little hope. Nighy is like a caged animal as Tom, pacing Kyra's flat as he delivers one tirade after another against whatever pops into his mind. No one does glib with quite the panache as Nighy, nor can anyone be sarcastic with quite as much charm. He even pronounces the final ""e"" of his words. Nighy has one bit of business in pulling a chair out from under a table with his foot and then pushing it back in that virtually defines his character. It's a gesture that Mulligan brilliantly parodies later in the play.      Matthew Beard is excellent as Edward, turning a role that basically serves at the start as provider of background information into a sensitive young man for whom one immediately feels pity. He races through the opening scene like he was on speed, but by the end the audience knows he is a troubled adolescent in need of love, something he is not going to get from his father. Bob Crowley's design, including a dismal flat with a two-gallon, wall-mounted water heater and a tiny four-hob cooker (on which Mulligan whips up a great-smelling spaghetti sauce) adds to the sense of futility that hangs over the play. There is even a small space heater much like the one Queen Elizabeth has at Balmoral in The Audience next door. It doesn't give off much heat, but Mulligan and Nighy make up for that.",direction,have,margin
"My name is Jamie and I'm an online date-aholic.  For the better part of the last eight years, I've dabbled on a variety of dating sites, sometimes one, two, three... or more at a time. Within the last year or so, I upped my game. It seemed like every week, there were new dating sites to try. And I couldn't help but eagerly sign up for each. It was like fad diets -- every type of site for every type of dater. Ones that connected you through friends of friends. Others that allowed you to date in groups. Others still that were based on nothing other than a shared religious preference. 

What started as a fun, silly experience rapidly spiraled out of control. I was up to five dating sites. Gone were the days where you needed to log onto a computer to chat -- your phone was your direct line to Datesville. I'd hop on Tinder and go through 50 matches without thinking twice about it. Couldn't sleep? I'd hop back on for another 100 swipes. I'd hunger for my noontime Hinge matches like a junkie waiting for a fix. When I got my OkCupid weekly matches, I couldn't click the app fast enough to see whom they'd chosen for me. Once connected, I'd often chat with as many as 10 guys simultaneously. I was legitimately interested in some. Others, I really didn't care about -- I did it just to pass the time.  Every now and then, these conversations would end with a date. More often than not, they went nowhere. I'd talk to guys for weeks without either of us initiating any hangout. We were virtual pen pals, wasting one another's time with random texts at odd hours. It was fine at first. I didn't mind the silly nonchalance with which everyone seemed to dabble. But then I got fed up. Two months ago, I started a new job. With the transition came a heaping load of responsibility, longer work hours and a greater strain on both my brain and my psyche than previously. My formerly bustling social life took a backseat as work took a toll. I needed more sleep to function at full capacity, so weeknight dates where I'd consume multiple drinks (rendering me slightly hungover the following day), were no longer options.  Dating requires a lot of energy, both physically and emotionally. It can be awesome. But it can also be draining. My former excitement at the prospect of weekly first dates gradually turned into reticence. I became more discriminating than eve r-- if I was going to go out, it better damn well be for a fun evening. So, a casual drink here or there seemed more like a burden than a perk. I'd also recently decided that I was fed up with what can only be classified as disrespect from a number of these men. Conversations that started on a friendly note often took on more sinister undertones as sexual topics were broached prematurely -- if I've never met you, why would I want a dick pic? Or to talk about 'what I like in bed'?  I began to get turned off by these interactions (not a good sign for a person I've never even met and was considering dating). It became more and more apparent that men were on these sites for very different reasons than women. (Why join a dating site if you have no interest in actually dating?) Worse still, even when I did manage to make it onto a date, more often than not, the follow up text from them would be something along the lines of, ""I'm not really looking to date but I'd love to hook up. You game?"" Ugh.  And yet, in spite of the fact that date after date went by without finding people truly worth dating, I couldn't quit. I'd check the sites multiple times a day, getting more and more frustrated as I went. I wasn't getting what I wanted. I was being disrespected. And I couldn't stop. So one day, after a long conversation with a close, wise friend who suggested that perhaps it was time to take a breather from online dating and try dating IRL, I took her advice.  I went for my morning run to think it over and by the time I got home, I'd mentally committed to going a month without online dating. That seemed like long enough to make a difference, but short enough that it didn't seem overwhelming.  The first day was rough. I missed the high of getting my matches. The thrill of connecting with someone. Those first butterflies when you start chatting with someone. But I wanted to give my theory a real shot. That if I wanted to meet someone worth dating, it wasn't going to start online.  Stay tuned for how it goes...",Hinge,'d,fix
"Originally published on www.capitalandmain.com By Danny Feingold With Senate confirmation of Donald Trump’s education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos now hanging by the thread of a likely tie-breaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence, one thing has become apparent: DeVos’ views on public education are well outside the mainstream of either party. Perhaps less well known is that DeVos has demonstrated a willingness to override and even go after Republicans who fail to completely embrace her program of charter schools, vouchers and deregulation. The defections this week of GOP Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who both announced that they would vote against DeVos, underscore a fact that Michigan Republicans have known for some time. DeVos is committed to an ideological stance on education that leaves little room for compromise. And as one of the state’s wealthiest and most powerful political donors — in the 2016 election year alone, she and her husband, Dick DeVos Jr., gave $2.7 million to Republican candidates — DeVos has the clout to enforce her will. (Since 1999, DeVos and her extended family have spent an estimated $82 million on political campaigns at the state and federal levels.) Republican State Senator Goeff Hansen, who represents Michigan’s 34th District, learned a painful lesson last year about DeVos’s hardline positions. Hansen became the unlikely champion of an extraordinary bipartisan effort, the Coalition for the Future of Detroit Schoolchildren, to rescue Detroit Public Schools (DPS) from years of financial insolvency and woeful academic performance. A central goal was to fix the destabilizing free-for-all system — likened by some to the Wild West — in which a dozen or more entities could open and close schools with virtually no oversight. That campaign, which unfolded over several years, eventually encompassed an almost unheard of alliance of teachers unions, charter schools, business leaders, legislators from both parties, civil rights organizations and grassroots advocacy groups. By the time Hansen introduced legislation in the Michigan State Senate, longtime adversaries had put aside their differences to embrace a package that few had thought possible when the process began. The proposed law passed by the Senate on March 2016, which also gained the support of Republican Governor Rick Snyder, would have created a commission charged with overseeing the opening and closing of schools, as well as authorizing $720 million to bring DPS out of near-bankruptcy and giving operating control back to the local district, which had been run by state for years. The legislation was passed with the support of both Democrats and Republicans and sent to the Michigan House of Representatives. Dave Pagel was one of the Michigan House Republicans who supported the creation of the oversight commission. “I did support the Detroit Education Commission,” Pagel told Capital & Main. “We needed to have some control over where schools were popping up. Simple choice doesn’t solve any problems; we need to find a way to improve education regardless of the choices that are happening.” DeVos and her allies, however, were unwilling to cede any ground in the war they had waged for years to ensure that charter schools in Michigan remain almost entirely unregulated. They worked to dismantle the bill, and by the time they were finished, the House had stripped the oversight commission from the legislation while adding draconian requirements for school closures. With the specter of DeVos withholding campaign funds looming over Republicans who dared to defy her, the new version of the bill passed the House by one vote, was approved by the same margin in the Senate and signed by Governor Snyder. The turn of events infuriated proponents of the original bipartisan legislation and left Hansen on the verge of tears. “This was a just and honest cause. Unfortunately, I’m unable to support this bill, and it pains me greatly to say that,” he said during a speech after the vote last June. “I keep being told that these compromise bills represents three-quarters of a loaf. Why should Detroit children accept less than what other children across the state are willing to accept?” Hansen wasn’t the only Republican leader whose efforts to pass the bipartisan bill were pushed aside by DeVos. John Rakolta, Jr., a conservative businessman who last July signed on as one of Donald Trump’s Michigan finance chairs, had been one of five co-chairs of the Coalition for the Future of Detroit Schoolchildren. Among those joining Rakolta in the coalition’s unlikely stewardship was David Hecker, president of the American Federation of Teachers Michigan. In right-to-work Michigan, bringing together a staunch Republican fundraiser like Rakolta and a labor leader like Hecker was nothing short of miraculous. But the two men, along with dozens of others in the coalition, had reached a hard-won consensus about how best to improve Detroit’s embattled public schools. But DeVos and others overrode the bipartisan coalition with a furious lobbying campaign. According to campaign finance documents, nearly $1.5 million was doled out by DeVos and members of her family to the state Republican Party and candidates in the aftermath of the legislation’s passage. Paul Muxlow was not one of the recipients of DeVos’ largesse. A member of Michigan’s House of Representatives, Muxlow, a traditional Republican, found himself on the wrong side of DeVos’ education crusade back in 2011, when he voted against eliminating caps on the number of charter schools in the state. The following year, he was targeted by a pro-charter lobbying group founded, and primarily funded, by DeVos and her family. He almost lost his seat when the group spent close to $200,000 to defeat him. “I’ve voted for almost everything the DeVoses wanted,” Muxlow told Bridge, a Michigan publication. “I’d walked a parade for Dick Devos when he ran for governor (in 2006). And then they ran the dirtiest campaign against me.” The bottom line for Michigan Republicans — and perhaps for GOP representatives anywhere — is that you cross or ignore DeVos and her educational crusade at your own peril.",you,is,peril
"Let me mention a small joy of my life. One afternoon and evening a week I take care of my 5½-year-old grandson, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that we take care of each other.  We always stop for cookies ― grandparents being allowed, according to The Official Rulebook of Child-Rearing (see p. 349), to shamelessly feed sweets to their grandchildren.  We draw strange pictures together, practice doing our numbers ― believe it or not, I have a curious habit of writing mine upside down and regularly have to be corrected! ― wander the neighborhood checking out the local pet barbers as they clip dogs of every imaginable size and shape, sample food in stores we pass, and go swimming. (He’s a genuine eel, capable of remarkable underwater feats.) And then there’s always that one moment ― I never know when it’s going to arrive ― where I suddenly find myself thinking about a future world that won’t be mine but will someday be his and my heart sinks.  Don’t misunderstand me.  I’m not thinking of the ordinary ravages of our present Trumpian world extended into the future.  That’s just run-of-the-mill stuff of human history, even if it’s hitting this country hard right now.  Autocratic figures come and go.  Bad kings, bad rulers, bad presidents: they and their terrible decisions are part and parcel of ordinary history, The Donald included.   No, when that moment hits me it’s because I’m imagining something that isn’t part of human history at all.  I’m imagining a world at least four to five degrees Celsius hotter than the pre-industrial one (as the prestigious Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicted back in 2014) or even hotter than that. I’m imagining rising sea levels that could someday make the coastal city my grandson and I regularly wander through a flood zone.  I’m thinking of mega-droughts, staggering heat waves, and fire seasons of unprecedented length and destructiveness.  I’m conjuring up refugee flows that leave the present ones in the dust.  I’m mulling over the fact that a near-majority of the American people elected a man dedicated not just to ignoring the reality of climate change, but to accelerating it via the loosing of the fossil fuel industry on the environment, aided and abetted by a rogue’s gallery of climate change deniers and oil company stooges. I look at my grandson and try to envision him so many decades from now in a world beyond my imagining, one no longer ruled by historical time but by planetary time, by environmental phenomena that, unlike autocrats and dreadful rulers, can’t be rebelled against, voted out of office, or toppled.  All this, at the very least, makes the Trump era a desperately lost opportunity.   Again, don’t misunderstand me. It’s not that I have no hope. You can’t look at a 5½ year old and not have hope. You can’t spend time with one of them and not feel a certain wonder at human ingenuity and creativity. So I continue to hope that somehow we’ll respond in ways clever enough and determined enough to leave the worst of what might happen to the dystopian dreamscapes of fiction.  Still, that sinking feeling’s there and it’s not going away, which is why I felt an instant connection with today’s piece, “Do Kids Die, Mom?,” by TomDispatch regular Frida Berrigan on her fears for her own children in a world that can easily seem as dystopian as hell itself.",that,’m,dust
"“Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printed: everything else is public relations.”  -George Orwell I have had many strange experiences as an education blogger. People have adapted my writing into a play. People have written to express a sincere desire for my death. I’ve had a teacher send me pictures of essays his composition students wrote in response to one of my articles. And I’ve had people email my workplace demanding I be fired. I guess Internet fame is a mixed bag. But after more than three years of blogging about education and social justice issues while teaching in the public school system, there’s one thing I’ve never experienced before: censorship. This is social media, after all. I’ve got no advertisers to please, no editor breathing down my neck. I can write whatever I want. That’s the benefit of being a blogger. No one can stop you from telling the truth. Well, no one except Facebook, apparently. For the first time in my blogging career, I was blocked from Mark Zuckerberg’s social networking platform because I had the audacity to post my blog to it. Now keep in mind I’ve been doing just that every week since July, 2014. Moreover, the article I posted was in no way different from my previous work. The article is called “School Choice is a Lie. It Does Not Mean More Options. It Means Less.” You can read it here. But almost as soon as I posted it to the Facebook page I keep for my blog, Gadfly on the Wall, I got a message saying I was blocked for a week for “violating community standards.” What community, exactly, is that? My article contains no hate speech. For once I even managed to control my own potty mouth. This is just an examination of why charter and voucher schools reduce options for parents and students – not increase them. It’s an argument. I lay out my reasons with reference to facts and make numerous connections to other people’s work and articles. I don’t understand how that “violates community standards.” A blogger friend of mine tells me that someone probably saw my article and reported it to Facebook as spam. That’s happened to him multiple times, he says, especially when he criticizes groups like Teach for America. Perhaps that’s what’s happened here. Some folks get so furious when I criticize their charter and voucher schools. Maybe they saw my latest piece and just wanted to silence me. I don’t know. I suppose another option is that it came from Zuckerberg, himself. He’s a big fan of school privatization. Perhaps he changed Facebook guidelines to crack down on people like me who throw shade on his pet school reforms. Or maybe my work was targeted because I’m critical of President Donald Trump. I did, after all, write an article this week called “Donald Trump is a Pathetic Excuse For a Human Being” that includes a picture of the chief executive as a poop emoji. Or maybe it was the National Rifle Association (NRA). The article before the school privatization piece was called “Guns and Profit – Why We’ll Do Absolutely Nothing New After This Las Vegas Shooting.” It was picked up by Commondreams.org, the LA Progressive and other left-leaning sites. Perhaps the firearms lobby had had enough. Who knows? I’ve pissed off a lot of people in three years. But I find it hard to believe I was actively targeted. I mean, this is still America, right? Right? Another option might be a rogue algorithm. Facebook is known to use various processes or sets of rules to govern calculations about what should and should not be allowed on the site. After all, they can’t leave all these decisions to living, breathing, human beings. That would cost too much money. Better to leave it to bots and computers. Perhaps something in my article tripped their robotic alarm bells. (ROBOT VOICE: He’s against Competency Based Education! EXTERMINATE!) I guess I’ll probably never know. In the meantime, Twitter is still open for my business. I can still share links in 140 characters or less – with hastags. And, the best part is that Trump might see it! But what about friends not on the Twitterverse? How do I even let people know what happened to me? Send a million separate emails!? Pick up the phone and – yuck – talk to people!? I sent a note to friends through Facebook Messenger about what happened, but that soon stopped working on me. I can’t message anyone else now. Still, the story seems to have leaked. People who know what’s happened have been kind enough to share the article. It’s being read and appreciated. I don’t know if my Facebook imprisonment has had a major effect on its distribution. But it’s probably had some dampening effect. I have to admit, it’s kind of frustrating. After all this time, many of us rely on Facebook for so much. I’m a member of the Badass Teachers Association, a group of more than 64,000 members who use the social media platform to discuss, plan and engage in various actions against corporate school reform. I’m also in United Opt Out National. It’s increasingly difficult for me to help plan our protest in Washington, DC, without Facebook. It never really hit me before how much of our lives flow through this one network. If someone wanted to disrupt political organizations dedicated to reforming the status quo, censoring people and posts on Facebook could be very effective. I haven’t been silenced, but I’ve been effectively muted. Most of my readers see my work through Facebook. Without it, my writing is out there, but much fewer people probably are in contact with it. So I suppose that brings me to you, intrepid reader. Somehow you found this article. Assuming Zuckerberg and his bots don’t change their minds, I probably won’t be able to post this article to Facebook. So if you saw it, you found it somewhere else. Or perhaps a friendly radical took a chance and posted it on Facebook, themselves, defiant in the possibility that the social media gestapo might crash down on them. Will you please do the same? Share my story. Let the world know what happened to me today. It’s not the most important thing that’s happened this week. And hopefully it will all be settled in seven interminable days. 168 hours. 10,080 minutes. But who’s counting? Or – who knows – perhaps I’ll be cleared of all charges, write a new article and the same thing will happen when I try to post it. I don’t know. In the meantime, I’m going to spend some time off the computer. Maybe I’ll open the doors and windows, let in some natural light and see what this “outside world” is like that people used to talk about. See you in a week. Live from Facebook Jail, The Gadfly on the Wall #FreeGadfly *** This article originally was published on the Gadfly on the Wall.  UPDATE: As of 10-9-17, I am still blocked on Facebook. I can see and like posts. I can use Messenger. But I can’t comment or share. Meanwhile, I’ve learned of several worrying actions conducted by Facebook that seems to imply what happened to me was no accident but represents a new trend in the social media platform moving forward. First, Facebook apparently plans to use a purveyor of fake news, the Weekly Standard, to fact check material. Second, school privatization propagandist Campbell Brown has been hired by Facebook to be a liaison with news organizations and block “fake news.” Third, I was by no means the only pro-education person blocked by Facebook for criticizing charter and voucher schools. The same thing happened to the Network for Education. Finally, as has widely been reported, Facebook allowed Russian hackers to use the platform to conduct a disinformation campaign during the last Presidential election. ",I,blocked,it
"The superintendent of a Houston-area school district threatened students with three-day suspensions if they participate in gun violence protests during school hours. Student-led protests and walkouts have erupted across the country in the wake of the deadly mass shooting last week at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 people dead. Participants have focused their energy on demanding lawmakers take action against gun violence. But Curtis Rhodes, superintendent of Needville Independent School District, warned students that they would face “consequences” for participating in such demonstrations. “Please be advised that the Needville ISD will not allow a student demonstration during school hours for any type of protest or awareness!!” Rhodes wrote in a statement posted Tuesday to Needville High School’s Facebook page. “Should students choose to do so, they will be suspended from school for 3 days and face all the consequences that come along with an out of school suspension.” “Life is all about choices and every choice has a consequence whether it be positive or negative,” he wrote. “We will discipline no matter if it is one, fifty, or five hundred students involved.” Amanda Johnson, a volunteer with the Texas chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, accused Rhodes of “fear-mongering” and creating “a missed opportunity.” “I can’t believe that the superintendent, instead of cooperating with the students, is threatening them the way that he is,” she said. “School shootings are far more disruptive than a school walkout.” School officials at one high school in Hollywood, Florida, roughly 30 miles to the south of Stoneman Douglas, told students there would “consequences” if they participated in a walkout on Wednesday.  Ben Gamla Preparatory Academy Principal Gayle Iacono later agreed to let students protest for 17 minutes at noon in the school parking lot. But when students began the demonstration, they found the school’s entry gates were locked, preventing them from leaving the school grounds. Students who jumped the fence to protest in front of the school were led back to class by school security personnel, according to local ABC affiliate WPLG-TV. Representatives for the Needville district and Ben Gamla Preparatory did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment. In contrast, some school districts have taken a more supportive approach to the demonstrations. For instance, the Leon County school system in Tallahassee, Florida,  announced that it would excuse students who participated in a rally Wednesday at the state Capitol. “Parents ultimately decide whether their children should attend school or participate in an out of school activity,” a statement posted to the district’s Facebook page said.  “These kids have got a very valid concern,” Johnson said, noting that her organization’s membership on Facebook had tripled since last week’s shooting. “They’re literally in fear for their lives.”",they,warned,demonstrations
"You don’t matter. That’s the message every survivor hears loud and clear when a rape kit goes untested. Behind every kit is a person ― usually a woman ― who has been brutalized in the most intimate of ways. And yet there are estimated to be hundreds of thousands of untested rape kits currently sitting in police storage across the country.  So, how did we get here?  That’s the question actress and activist Mariska Hargitay answers in her new HBO documentary “I Am Evidence,” set to air April 16. The film, produced by the “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” star and Trish Adlesic, and co-directed by Adlesic and Geeta Gandbhir, takes a human approach to an epidemic that has reduced survivors, their stories and their trauma to a box of evidence.  “To me, the backlog is one of the clearest and most shocking demonstrations of how we regard these crimes in our society,” Hargitay says in the film. “Testing rape kits sends a fundamental and crucial message to victims of sexual violence: You matter. What happened to you matters. Your case matters.”  In a conversation with HuffPost, Hargitay and Adlesic laid out the herculean task they had in front of them four years ago when they began making this documentary. “One of the things that was so difficult about making this movie is that there is just so much pain involved,” Hargitay said. She hopes the documentary “holds up a real hard mirror” to people who have turned a blind eye to this epidemic.  Watch the trailer for “I Am Evidence” below. Story continues below video.  And the film is a hard one to look away from. “I Am Evidence” features 14 courageous survivors telling their stories of assault and the subsequent poking and prodding that comes with enduring a rape kit.  “I am evidence that there is more to that box, there is a human being there. It is not just a kit. This is a person,” a survivor named Erica says in the film.  The women discuss the inevitable re-victimization of being questioned by law enforcement and the agonizing wait to get their kits tested ― a wait that often never ends. “The fact of the matter is, if we have DNA testing, if we have the ability to fix this problem and we don’t test these kits, we’re saying that sexual assault is not important,” Hargitay said.   Since the rape kit backlog hit the public consciousness nearly 10 years ago, 225,000 rape kits have been uncovered, according to a program called End The Backlog. That program is the work of anti-sexual violence nonprofit The Joyful Heart Foundation, which Hargitay founded after thousands of survivors shared their abuse stories with her after she began appearing as Detective Olivia Benson on “SVU.” Testing rape kits is important for several reasons: It can identify an unknown perpetrator, it can confirm the presence of a known suspect, it can confirm a survivor’s account of an assault, it can help solve other cases that might not involve sexual violence, it can exonerate innocent people. And it can connect a suspect to other crimes around the country. Indeed, a disturbing takeaway from the film is just how common serial rapists are. One scene depicts law enforcement officials, who have finally begun testing old rape kits, linking one rapist to two women living in completely different parts of the country. By testing the kits, police are finally catching serial offenders. “I Am Evidence” lays out the root causes of this countrywide backlog: misogyny and racism. The systemic lack of policies and protocols, of resources and funding, and ― most glaringly ― of training for first responders, reflects these prejudices. As with other systems that abuse and disregard marginalized people, poor black women get the worst of it. “Nobody gives a damn about women in this country,” concludes Detroit prosecutor Kym Worthy in the film. Worthy has been tackling the rape kit backlog head-on since 2009, when 11,000 untested rape kits were uncovered in her city. Adlesic said it’s “absolutely necessary” for first responders to receive sexual assault training and recalled an “I Am Evidence” screening last year where a man made a powerful comment during the Q&A portion.  “He was quite emotional and spoke about being an emergency room doctor. He hadn’t had the training to conduct a sexual assault kit, and he was so afraid he was going to get it wrong, or make someone feel awful for not knowing how to do it,” she said. “It helped us understand that we really need to advocate for a curriculum in medical schools and law enforcement agencies so that people learn how to do this.” All too often, police officers learn the law, but no one teaches them the varying ways victims respond to trauma. Along with bringing their own prejudices to the job, officers often don’t know what trauma looks like or how trauma affects memory. They also might not realize how often sexual violence triggers involuntary paralysis in a victim ― an often-forgotten “freeze” component of the fight-or-flight reflex ― in order to get them out of the situation alive.  Hargitay described the lack of resources to investigate these crimes, as well as cultural misunderstandings surrounding sexual violence, as a “microcosm” of how we as a country regard women.  “Trish and I, we wanted to make a hard-hitting film,” she said. “It is a painful movie to watch, and it’s the facts. And it’s time that we take a look at not sweeping this under the carpet, that we treat women, and treat our society, and all survivors with the humanity, the empathy that they deserve.”  Adlesic told HuffPost she hopes this documentary forces people to care about this issue and creates change. Most of all, she hopes this film shows survivors that they’re not alone. “I want them to know that we understand, and that we care and that we want to help give them the support they need and deserve,” she said. “I want survivors to feel heard and know that they matter, and that violence against women matters, and that we walk in hand with you to a better way of life for everyone.”  “I Am Evidence” will air on HBO on Monday, April 16, at 8 p.m. Eastern. ",they,laid,documentary
"WASHINGTON, May 19 (Reuters) - Donald Trump, Jr., the U.S. president’s eldest son, met in August 2016 with an envoy representing the crown princes of United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The meeting was first reported by the New York Times on Saturday and confirmed by an attorney representing Trump Jr. The meeting was a chance for the envoy to offer help to the Trump presidential campaign, according to The New York Times. The newspaper said the meeting, held on Aug. 3, 2016, was arranged by Erik Prince, the founder and former head of private military contractor Blackwater, who attended the meeting. Joel Zamel, a co-founder of an Israeli consulting firm, was also in attendance. Alan Futerfas, Trump Jr.’s attorney, said on Saturday that nothing came of the meeting. “Prior to the 2016 election, Donald Trump Jr. recalls a meeting with Erik Prince, George Nader and another individual who may be Joel Zamel,” Futerfas said in an emailed statement. “They pitched Mr. Trump Jr. on a social media platform or marketing strategy. He was not interested and that was the end of it.” A company connected to Zamel also worked on a proposal for a “covert multimillion-dollar online manipulation campaign” to help Trump, utilizing thousands of fake social media accounts, the New York Times report said. The envoy, Lebanese-American businessman George Nader, told Trump, Jr. that the crown princes of Saudi Arabia and the UAE were eager to help his father win the 2016 presidential election, the paper said. Since 1974, the United States has barred foreign nationals from giving money to political campaigns and it later barred them from donating to political parties. The campaign financing laws also prohibit foreign nationals from coordinating with a campaign and from buying an ad that explicitly calls for the election or defeat of a candidate. The Saudi and UAE embassies in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Wall Street Journal last month reported that investigators working for U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller had met with Zamel, and that Mueller’s team was looking into his firm’s work and his relationship with Nader. Mueller is investigating whether Russia meddled in the presidential election and if Moscow colluded with the Trump campaign, as well as whether Trump committed obstruction of justice by trying to thwart the U.S. Department of Justice probe. Trump has denied any collusion with Russia and has called the Mueller investigation a “witch hunt.” The New York Times report said the meetings are an indication that other countries besides Russia may have offered help to Trump’s presidential campaign. Mueller’s investigators have questioned witnesses in Washington, New York, Atlanta, Tel Aviv and elsewhere regarding possible foreign help to the campaign, the report said. Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller’s team, declined to comment on the report. Zamel’s attorney, Marc Mukasey, said in a statement to Reuters that his client “offered nothing to the Trump campaign, received nothing from the Trump campaign, delivered nothing to the Trump campaign and was not solicited by, or asked to do anything for, the Trump campaign.” “Media reports about Mr. Zamel’s engaging in ‘social media manipulation’ are uninformed,” Mukasey added. “Mr. Zamel’s companies harvest publicly available information for lawful use.” Kathryn Ruemmler, Nader’s lawyer, told the paper that her client “has fully cooperated with the U.S. special counsel’s investigation and will continue to do so.” Erik Prince, who is also the brother of U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, could not be immediately reached for comment.   (Reporting by Yeganeh Torbati)",client,told,investigation
"I guarantee every single person reading this piece knows someone who was, or is currently being, sexually harassed/assaulted. You may not even know it. In just the two to three days since the Weinstein scandal broke I’ve already heard from three women who say they are actively being subjected to sexual harassment in the work place as we speak. One of whom works for a major music management firm, one who works at a Fortune 500 company, and one in the marketing field who was recently subjected to an unexpected tongue-down-the-throat kiss at the end of a business dinner in lieu of the traditional hand shake. All of whom give the same response when asked why they haven’t spoken out: “I’ll never work again.” Or, “They’ll ruin me.” They even go as far as to say it’s part of the job. “If you work in the music biz and you’re an attractive female, you have a bullseye on your back from day one, so just get used to it.” Or, “When you work for a company that’s ninety percent men, you’re guaranteed to experience some type of sexual harassment.” Or, “I didn’t know what to do. I was so shocked by his appalling advance, I just stood there, frozen.” Did you do anything the next day? “No, I need the job.” In the piece I wrote back in April, when the Bill O’Reilly/Roger Ailes scandal broke, I called attention to the fact that these misogynistic low-lifes walked away with millions in compensation for their troubles while their victims received just a fraction of their harasser’s buy-out, and, most likely, painted with the stigma of whistle-blowing bitch in their respective fields. Those in the board rooms who choose to award huge monetary sums to these disgraced executives, and who normalize this reprehensibly offensive behavior, are just as guilty as the ones committing the acts. They are accomplices. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to realize the corporate culture of the past several decades has, in fact, normalized sexual harassment as “part of the job.” Our male-dominated society has created the overwhelming perception amongst females that, should you come forward and accuse a co-worker/boss/employer, of sexual harassment, it’s you who will pay the price. And, it’s not merely perception. It’s reality. Even though the way we handle things internally in the work place, i.e., human resources response/action has advanced leaps and bounds since the sixties/seventies, and one tweet can now sink an entire career(s), there still seems to be the long held belief that should you decide to do something about it, you will be subject to severe consequences that will last decades for doing so. So, be a good girl and keep your mouth shut. Of course, it doesn’t help when you have an unabashedly proud misogynist in the oval office, who came to power despite a tape capturing him bragging about his assaults on women. Furthering the proof, as comedian Patton Oswald so eloquently pointed out, this country is far more sexist than we are racist. And we’re pretty fucking racist.  My friend asked me why the hell a filthy rich, mega-mogul like Harvey Weinstein would whip out his johnson in a restaurant kitchen and masturbate in front of an unwilling participant when he could easily hire a hooker or take a mistress or any number of actresses looking to advance their careers, overnight? As a male, I guess I’m supposed to be able to comment with authority on what goes through every guys head in moments like that, but who the heck knows why he did what did? If anything, I believe it was most likely due to the fact that, in front of beautiful women, the biggest, most powerful movie mogul on the planet still feels like he’s an ugly, insignificant nerd back in the sixth grade. And the peep show in the kitchen was a power-play of revenge of sorts for years of abuse/ridicule as a child. This was Weinstein’s scarred, inner-child’s way of showing his conquest, and, by proxy, all the other females who taunted him back then, who was boss, now and forever. The most damning proof of Weinstein’s sleazy advances to date has just surfaced in Ronan Farrow’s piece in the New Yorker, in which he, himself, admits he gropes women regularly, as that’s what he’s used to. A recording of the exchange between Weinstein, with Italian model/actress Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, leaves no doubt as to Weinstein’s M.O. It’s impossible to overstate the bravery of Ms. Gutierrez, a woman alone in a hotel with a powerful sexual predator, whose career and reputation could be easily squashed overnight, yet who, decided to risk her career/reputation in order to get the pathetically desperate Weinstein on tape. Personally, I hope seeing all these brave, well-known actresses finally speaking out will motivate the hundreds, if not thousands, of women who experience the same treatment in their own lives on a daily basis to come forward. It doesn’t have to be sexual in nature, either. Harassment can simply be being verbally abused in front of your co-workers, or inexplicably passed over for a promotion. The only way to stop this type of degrading, dehumanizing behavior is to keep coming forward. One after the other after the other. Until the offending parties will have no choice but to think long and hard about the possibility of winding up the star subject of the next piece in the Times.",what,guess,that
"In the days leading up to my semester-long study abroad in Madrid, my parents started giving me “the talk.” I knew it was coming – the talk about how to handle myself as a young Jew abroad, especially in a country with an intolerant past toward my people. The reality is that being openly and unapologetically Jewish can spark a spectrum of unprecedented reactions – from heartfelt to hateful. Justified fear of the latter is what prompted my parents to urge me not to take my Magen David necklace with me to Spain. But hope for the former, while aware of the possible consequences of outward Jewish expression, is what prompted me to take it anyway. Perhaps it’s worth noting that my Magen David, my Jew-o-metric shape – as I like to call it – often goes unnoticed, even among most Jews. Three-dimensional and somewhat unidentifiable, usually only those who know what it is call attention to the ball of triangles hanging around my neck. Which is why I was so surprised when the young woman behind the cash register of a Madrid-based café abruptly pointed it out. I had just finished paying for my salad when she fixed her eyes on my necklace. With a perplexed gaze, she reached over the counter without warning and held its pendant in between her fingers. Yet it wasn’t this gesture that stunned me at first. After all, this is Spain, the country without personal space and overt bluntness, where my boss gives me two kisses on the cheek when I meet him for a meeting, where we speak our minds and emote without resistance because life here is lived better honestly and candidly. Rather, it was what she was reaching for that took me aback. Seeing past my blanket scarf and oversized denim jacket, an apparently unknowing Spaniard was calling attention to my discreet Magen David – the one I wear daily and twirl absent-mindedly on the Metro. And instantly, my parents’ cautionary tales came to mind as I ran to conclusions, feeling sheepishly naïve: perhaps it is best not to express my Judaism so openly - just in case. The thought stayed in my head as I attempted to keep conversation neutral when she asked me what my necklace was, her hand still stretched over the register and around my pendant with confused interest. …A star, I said. A meaningless substitute for this Jew-o-metric shape that has rested next to my heart for the past four years. The thought stayed in my head when she asked me what country I bought it from. And this time, I decided not to shy away from the embrace of my heritage. After clear hesitation, I answered: Israel - because I shouldn’t fear saying the name of the country where I bought my jewelry. The name of a country that has become so politicized that I felt relieved when her co-worker chimed in, having put two and two together to excitedly boast his knowledge of Judaism and Judaica. I felt like this was him leveling with her when he mentioned that what I simply called “a star” was actually a religious symbol. That this was him getting her on my side, to accept my answer – as if my honesty calls for acceptance. But why did I feel so threatened by her curiosity, as she continued to look at my necklace and ask me what it means? Why did I feel the need to add that while my necklace resembles a Jewish star, it’s really “just a Kabbalah symbol!” That’s true, by the way, but I don’t tell that to anyone else who asks. I don’t even practice Kabbalah. I bought this necklace because to me, it’s a Magen David before it’s a Merkaba. One that I feel proud to wear. Yet I didn’t share this piece of my culture with her. I couldn’t even pretend to feel comfortable being open, even though I was in Madrid. In España. The land of friendliness, touchy gestures, and open dialogue. Maybe because I was always trained to see this sort of dialogue as closed. I know I am not the only one who receives “the talk” from their classically-concerned Jewish parents. Jews around the world have been conditioned to steer toward the side of caution. We have seen discrimination, expulsion, persecution. Year-round, we observe holidays that celebrate our resistance and courage toward those who wanted us gone. Being defensive runs deep through our veins, passed down from generations before us that have kept our people here – strong and resilient. This past is what makes me proud to be a Jew, it’s what makes me feel connected to the Jewish community of Madrid – one that has faced so much adversity, yet has still bounced back. It’s what impels me to wear my Magen David here, openly and unapologetically, in typical Spanish fashion. But how am I supposed to embrace this necklace, my familiar Jewish identity, if I can’t feel comfortable talking about it? Perhaps it’s time to reevaluate my approach, to reconsider if I always want to be on the defense or if I want to proactively embrace our narrative with confidence. I know anti-Semitism exists; beyond the myriad of incidents on American university campuses, Jews are the targets of violent and non-violent anti-Semitic attacks worldwide. I understand the cautionary parental advice. But simply avoiding conversation perpetuates the lack of knowledge - the root of the problem so many generations of Jews have been trying to avoid. Judaism incorporates the notion of hospitality and inclusion – a mitzvah, or good deed, embraced not only in scripture, but most obviously on Jewish holidays such as Sukkot, when it is encouraged to welcome strangers into one’s home and life. It’s an opportunity to be open out of the sheer desire to be inclusive to all, because everyone deserves our belonging and respect – and that should extend beyond the confines of our personal lives and into our mundane, daily conversations. Subtle actions often go unexpectedly noticed, and that mustn’t be taken lightly. It’s okay for others to ask about what they don’t know, and it’s even more okay that we share, because this is how we learn and connect, in the purest of ways. The more we know, the better equipped we are to inform others, make educated observations, and open our minds to new ideas. I have been fortunate in Spain to have encountered open-minded people, even when I had trouble being open-minded myself. And I have been lucky to have found a community of young Jews – Spanish Jews, international Jews – who also wear their Judaism with pride, embracing their colorful Jewish heritages loudly and proudly, together – in Spain, of all places. After all, holding back thoughts out of the fear of someone else’s reaction just hurts both parties and stunts a connection that could have been: The connection between me and my non-Jewish classmates, as I explained bits of Jewish culture outside an ancient synagogue in Toledo. The connection between a Jewish friend and her waiter in Barcelona, who wore a hadaya around his neck. The connections spurred on by the open-minded and the shameless, the curious and the willing. If not for our own sake, then for everyone else’s: let’s ask the hard questions, answer with honesty, and stop letting the unknown prevent us from seeking or providing the truth, because it’s these pursuits of knowledge that keep us connected and moving forward.",that,was,me
"For HuffPost’s #LoveTakesAction series, we’re telling stories of how people are standing up to hate and supporting those most threatened. What will you stand up for? Tell us with #LoveTakesAction. What constitutes political artwork? Well, it depends. For the majority of Americans ― namely those who aren’t straight, able-bodied, cis-gendered, white men ― simply depicting the banal realities of daily life has long been a political gesture. As Los Angeles–based artist Shing Yin Khor told The Huffington Post: “I do believe that the personal is political, and have always felt that writing about myself ― as a brown, immigrant woman ― is by default a political gesture because our voices are incredibly underrepresented in all creative fields.” Shing predominately works in sculpture and installation art, but a few years ago, she began publicly sharing her autobiographical comics. Her cartoons tackled subjects like heartbreak, masturbation, adventure travels and greatest fears ― many topics that aren’t often explored from the perspective of a woman of color.  “Even if I am just making work about my time spent in national parks,” Shing said, “I am pointing out that brown women also hike in national parks, which is a particular narrative that is usually centered on the experiences of white people.” However, since President Donald Trump took office, Shing, who is also bisexual, noticed her work changing tenor. “I can’t stop my work from arcing in a political direction,” she said, “when my actual identity as a human being is something the Trump administration wants to unconstitutionally deny basic rights to.”  For many Americans, life under Trump has not been business as usual. An executive order against people of one religion along with the dread of other restrictive orders that may come have led some people to question their daily habits and responsibilities, reevaluating whether their life choices are still valid, effective, enough. Shing, too, contemplated giving up her practice to go to train as an abortion provider or civil rights lawyer ― something that could have a more direct social impact. On the day of Trump’s inauguration, Shing planned to spend the day in bed. While scrolling through social media on her phone, she landed on a photo of a woman who became one of the day’s most celebrated heroes: an older Asian-American woman in a purple parka, her two middle fingers raised toward the heavens like a boss. “It was an impulse,” Shing said of the decision to paint the woman she affectionately dubbed #ResistanceAuntie. “The painting took 10 minutes, I quickly posted it on my social feeds, and ... It just kind of spread.” Shing’s painting quickly went viral, receiving over 2,000 likes on Twitter. She soon posted a link to a high-resolution image of the artwork, available for use under a free culture license. This too, was a protest in itself. “I am a strong proponent of Creative Commons licensing and release as much of my art as I can for free under a license that allows for non-commercial derivative works,” Shing said, adding, “I will continue to do whatever little I can to change the way that people interact with art [...] and invite everyone to adapt my art as they see fit.” That was Day One of Trump’s presidency, and Shing has far from slowed down. Following the president’s executive order banning refugees from Syria and temporarily blocking travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, the artist felt obligated ― like many around the country ― to take action. Except, as a working artist, she had limited funds to donate to organizations advocating for immigrants and refugees. Also, as Shing put it, “I am kind of an anxious and introverted potato and even thinking about going to the protests made me feel terribly anxious.” Nonetheless, she wanted to contribute in an impactful way. On Saturday evening, when many protestors swarmed airports around the country to protest Trump’s ban, Shing decided to set up a live-stream on her computer so others could watch her paint the Statue of Liberty, the symbol of promise and freedom that greeted countless immigrants as they approached American soil.  Shing planned to sell the resulting paintings for $50 each and donate all proceeds to the ACLU. She estimated she’d make about 10 over the course of five hours. The people, however, wanted more, and Shing pulled an all-nighter to deliver. She ended up painting 40 pictures of Lady Liberty over the course of 13 hours, raising $2,000 for the ACLU.  “The whole art marathon was an impulse I thought about on the way home and launched just an hour later,” Shing tweeted the following morning. “But it works, so let’s do it more.” Another tweet thanked her many supporters: “You’ve given me faith that making art instead of being at a protest is NOT useless civic action.” In the future, Shing hopes to participate in similarly challenging feats of endurance art, with proceeds benefitting those put at risk by Trump’s administration.  On Tuesday, she tweeted a drawing of Nora al-Awlaki, the 8-year-old American girl killed in a U.S. military raid conducted Sunday in southern Yemen, noting that she had resolved to wake up each morning and paint a child killed by Trump’s administration. “I hope I will not be doing this every morning,” she clarified in a later tweet. “I usually meditate, but it’s not quite working lately, so I might as well just stay angry.” The world prays that Shing will not have to start each morning with a portrait like Nora’s. Nonetheless, the artist is determined to push onward with her activist art practice. And she’s not alone. Every morning, I'm going to try and paint an American child killed by the Trump administration. pic.twitter.com/iTaTHDGjc6 “I am very much inspired by artist friends of mine who are continuing to do both their work and advocacy at the same time,” Shing said. She mentioned Mari Naomi, who maintains the Cartoonists of Color Database, who recently edited and curated a comic series called State of Emergency, featuring cartoonists’ responses to the Trump administration. There are plenty more. “My friend Steenz coordinated a zine series with many other artists called Take Comfort, Take Care, and hands them out at protests. My friend Shivana made this great image about starting activism, that is, bringing activism work to light in a very approachable and simple way. My friend Autumn will be teaching a zine workshop at her mosque in Canada,” she said. “There is so much good work happening every single day.” Still, Shing occasionally struggles with how best to participate in the effort to resist Trump’s policies. In times of uncertainty and anxiety, she often turns to an essay Toni Morrison wrote in 2004 following the re-election of former President George W. Bush, when the iconic author was overwhelmed by feelings of powerlessness and despair.

"President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled a scheduled June 12 summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un after recent sparring between the two countries over the planned nuclear talks. “Sadly, based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting,” Trump wrote in a letter to Kim, which was sent to reporters. Read Trump’s letter (story continues below):  Trump Letter by Anonymous FBZLGr on Scribd South Korean officials appeared blindsided by the announcement. “We are attempting to make sense of what, precisely, President Trump means,” said spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom, according to The Washington Post’s Anna Fifield. South Korean President Moon Jae-In urged both Trump and Kim to hold direct talks, South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency reported. It’s also unclear whether State Department officials were aware of Trump’s decision before he released the letter. When asked if the announcement came as a surprise, a staffer in the office that works on North Korea issues said he had to check with State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert. Speaking at the White House later Thursday, Trump said he had just spoken with military officials, as well as the leaders of South Korea and Japan. They are “ready for foolish or reckless acts be taken by North Korea,” he said, adding that “an unfortunate situation is forced upon us.” “Hopefully positive things will be taking place with respect to the future of North Korea. If they don’t, we are more ready than we have ever been before,” he said, apparently a threat of military action. On a call with reporters, a senior White House official asserted that Trump “had constant communication with our allies,” but did not explain why U.S. allies were caught off guard. The official did not say whether Trump and Kim had spoken directly. Of the letter, the official said Trump had “dictated every word himself.” Trump’s announcement came hours after North Korean officials threatened to cancel the summit, angered by recent comments from Vice President Mike Pence and national security adviser John Bolton, who compared North Korea with Libya. North Korean officials view Libya as a cautionary tale and called Bolton’s remarks “awfully sinister.” After Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi gave up his nuclear weapons program in 2003, an armed revolution aided by a U.S. and NATO military intervention ousted him in 2011. Rebel forces captured and brutally killed Gaddafi during the conflict. “World knows too well that our country is neither Libya nor Iraq which have met miserable fate,” a senior North Korean official said in a statement this month. Earlier Thursday, North Korea announced that it had destroyed tunnels at what they say is the country’s only nuclear test site. Trump did not acknowledge the concession in his letter. The senior White House official said there was no way to confirm whether the tunnels had been destroyed because only a select group of foreign journalists had witnessed the process. No nuclear experts or monitors were present to inspect the site. Cracks began to emerge in plans for the summit last week, after North Korea threatened to call off the meeting if the Trump administration demanded the country completely denuclearize. Trump appeared to soften his rhetoric toward North Korea this week, saying that a more gradual option of denuclearization was a possibility. But he teased the summit’s uncertain fate. “We’re moving along. We’ll see what happens. There are certain conditions we want to happen. I think we’ll get those conditions. And if we don’t, we won’t have the meeting,” Trump told reporters Tuesday, without specifying what those conditions would be. The next day, Trump told Fox News there was a “good chance” the summit would take place. Trump, in his remarks Thursday, suggested that the summit could still happen “at some later date.” “Hopefully everything will work out well with North Korea,” he said. “A lot of things can happen.” Trump had touted the renewed diplomacy with North Korea as a triumph for his administration, suggesting that he should win a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. The White House push for negotiations in recent months was a dramatic shift from Trump’s initial posture toward North Korea. Last year, Trump and Kim were locked in an escalating battle of insults, which included Trump threatening North Korea with “fire and fury” if the country took action against the United States. Jessica Schulberg and Akbar Ahmed contributed reporting. This article has been updated to include Trump’s comments and information from a call with reporters. ",he,said,Korea
"If you have been watching political tectonics on both sides of the Atlantic, you may have noticed that analysts are increasingly getting it wrong: ""it"" being economics, politics, and social trends. The all of it, wrong. Why is this? Before you start reading this post, please consider listening to the podcast of my 12 min radio discussion on this subject to set up the background for this article. Soundcloud link to the podcast below. Just hit Play. Not in Kansas Anymore We are now deep into a digital transformation, and a new way of thinking and working and living. The business models of our past are faltering. Legacy thinking is virtually unfit for this digital age. The reality is that the conditions within which humanity operates are not what they used to be. Yet, thousands of self-proclaimed experts continue their important work with obsolete methods and mindsets, outdated hardware and software. A prime example of this is the hysteria that surrounds automation and artificial intelligence. Almost every newspaper and media outlet warns of an apocalyptic future when technology will fracture the employment landscape. As a result, many fear that technology is creating job-stealing robots. On that score, there are many lessons to be learned from our past. For example, the industrial revolution taught us that as traditional jobs disappear, we need to ensure that people of all ages are sufficiently educated to prepare and take advantage of the new emerging roles in our immediate future. Burying our heads in the sand and arming our children with skills for roles that will no longer exist is certainly not the answer. Neither is clinging to business models of the past or recreating the good-old days. The times demand new skills, new mindsets, new competencies, and new institutions. Stuck in the Past This backward glance is one of the problems that I encountered with President Trump's campaign slogan ""Make America Great Again."" This is not a post against our President, I respect our presidency. This is not about politics. It's about vision. It is impossible to go back in time or to recreate the past. Building a better and brighter future is the only way forward. If we compare the jobs of one hundred years ago to the jobs of the present, we would be stunned by the standard of living and the thankless work. Creative directors, content strategists, app developers and social media managers are a product of our times. The mentality of doing what you love is also a product of the epoch.  Indeed, hundreds of traditional roles have disappeared over the years, but they have been replaced with new job titles for our digital age. The Labor Force of Today The Obama administration had published this report to Congress in February 2016. The HuffPost had also discussed the contents of this report when it was published. I quote from that report: Despite the big scary headlines, we are not running out of work. The challenge that faces society and government is that many people see the available jobs as, on the one hand, unworthy of them. On the other, they see themselves as lacking the skills to qualify. It is true that the growing demise of middle-skill jobs could cause employment polarization where lower paid workers serve the more affluent without upward mobility. This dynamic would undoubtedly be a step backward. However—once again—the lessons learned from past economic transformations suggest it does not have to be this way. For example, today it is difficult to imagine that people once blamed the tractor for killing agricultural jobs. In fact, this new machine left an entire generation without work on farms. It also led to the inception of the high school movement, which then led to greater investment in education and ultimately created tremendous prosperity. Although we often congratulate ourselves for just how far we have come as a society, the truth is that we have the same problems today as we did 200 years ago. In Sum Whether they be the Luddites of the early 1800s or the analysts and journalists of 2017, the issues are essentially the same. The fear of machines, robots, and technology rendering humans obsolete and taking away our jobs. Make no mistake that many traditional roles we hold dear will slowly disappear. The transition from an analog to a digital world will not be easy. To thrive, we will need to invest in ourselves rather than in things. We will need to secure for ourselves the relevant skills to succeed. This transition is as it should be for the same reason that we probably don’t want to carry on the work of our grandparents. Not to say preserving a legacy is entirely unwanted, but it is not a sustainable policy for an entire society—especially one in flux like ours. As technology continues to pervade every aspect of human life, change—within us and around us—will remain the only constant. Sure, there are challenges and difficult decisions ahead of us. Take heart. Our destiny is in our hands, not in the hands of the machines we create. Don’t let any publication tell you otherwise.",we,need,things

"Artist: Klassik
EP: Spring
Genre: R&B, Hip Hop, Soul, Funk
Release Date: February 2015
Reviewer: Brandi Andres Find it at: Soundcloud Admittedly, I don't often listen to rap or hip-hop on repeat, unless I'm rallying for a girls' night out in Los Angeles or watching my favorite episodes of Empire. My personal tastes, of late, have leaned more toward a coffeehouse variety with lyrics that inspire deep thought processes and embody the many cold and wintery nights I've spent in peaceful solitude at home. In other words, mood music. Today, however, I was reminded that just as music can serve to accommodate one's moods, it can also introduce a necessary, and welcome, atmospheric tone. Such was the case when I first listened to Klassik's new EP, Spring. From the first few rhythmic beats of the opening track, ""Go Far,"" I was hooked. Soulful sound? Check. Appealing, familiar tonality? Check. Thought-provoking and inspiring lyrics? Check. Spring has everything it needs to launch this Milwaukee artist into the next-level stratosphere. If only the EP offered more than the sum of its three songs.  Thankfully, this is the second EP in Klassik's four-part Seasons series, the rest of which is scheduled to be released this summer and fall, consecutively. That makes an album-length number of themed songs that will be released within 12 months. Smart.  This makes Klassik not only a skillful producer, keyboardist, guitarist and lyricist, but also a marketing genius, all of which equate to him being the next big thing in hip-hop. Where the first EP in the series, Winter, focused its energy on the icy season's isolation and despair, Spring brings with it a feeling of ""rebirth and rejuvenation"" says Klassik. ""Within the artistic cycle, it is the moment when new perspectives are introduced, and raw inspiration and creative purpose blossom.""  I listened to the tracks before reading about the artist, which I've found helps me consider, honestly, my individual take on the music prior to being inundated with outside influences. My initial take: Klassik's sound has a Pharcyde feel — and that was before I noticed the third track, ""Otha Fish,"" a remix of Slimkid3's solo cut from the Bizarre Ride II The Pharcyde.  The fast-pitched rhymes and funky, dance beat of Spring's second track, ""Know it all,"" also reflects an Outkast-meets-Kool Keith vibe. (On a side note, I went back and listened to Winter, and Klassik shows a whole different side to his persona.) ""Spring embodies this revitalized spirit through more rapid fire wordplay and accelerated tempos that work vigorously to shake the frost of Winter,"" says Klassik, whose musical influences include Stevie Wonder, John Coltrane, Kanye West, Pharrell Williams and Steely Dan. So, what was it about Klassik's style of hip-hop that made me perk up and want to hear more? It would be fair to say the change of season, paired with the artist's creative ode to new beginnings, altered my sensibility, allowing me to open my mind and listen with revitalized ears. But why not give credit where it's due? Klassik is, for all intents and purposes, poised to be a classic.",EP,offered,songs
"A man accused of raping a Yale classmate on Halloween 2015 was found not guilty Wednesday by a New Haven, Connecticut, jury after a trial of less than two weeks. A woman referred to only as Jane Doe, now 24, accused Saifullah Khan, now 25, of raping her in her dorm room after she had vomited multiple times from drinking too much alcohol. Khan said that Doe had initiated the sexual encounter, which she said she barely remembered. Khan was found not guilty on all charges of sexual assault in the first, second, third and fourth degrees after his lawyers cast doubt on Doe’s memory and called attention to her clothing. The defense also alleged that Yale officials had influenced the investigation carried out by the university’s own police force, in an effort to prove that Yale took sexual assault seriously.  Research shows that sexual assault occurs on college campuses nationwide, yet relatively few incidents are reported to authorities and even fewer make it to trial. Just how few is unknown. According to the anti-sexual violence organization RAINN, 11.2 percent of undergraduate and graduate students experience rape or sexual assault through physical force, violence or incapacitation. Yet a whopping 89 percent of colleges reported zero incidents of rape in 2015, according to a May 2017 American Association of University Women report using data from the Department of Education. Doe and Khan were both seniors at the time of the alleged assault. While Doe has graduated, Khan, an Afghanistan native studying cognitive science, was suspended in November 2015 and has not returned to the school.  A jury heard testimony from Doe, Khan, law enforcement and various witnesses beginning Feb. 26. Doe told the jurors that she became inebriated after consuming two rum-and-cokes, one shot of hard liquor and two cups of wine at a 2015 Halloween party, the Yale Daily News reported. Her friends testified that she did not typically drink very much, if at all, according to the New Haven Register. Later in the evening, Doe accompanied friends to a Yale Symphony Orchestra concert, but said she vomited at the show and left to use the bathroom. After she was denied re-entry due to her intoxication, Doe said she went back to her dorm, accompanied by Khan. When they got to her room, Doe said Khan restrained and raped her. She also said that Khan took her phone and sent text messages to her friends to let them know she made it back safely. Khan denied the rape accusation and characterized their sexual encounter as consensual, the Register reported. In Khan’s telling, Doe did not appear too intoxicated to consent. The pair had flirted during the concert, he said. When they returned to her dorm, Khan said she did not appear to have difficulty walking. Khan’s attorney Norm Pattis offered an alternate explanation for surveillance footage showing his client supporting Doe as she appeared to stagger forward, the Register wrote. “How many times have you seen young lovers walk across campus in just such a pose? Does it look to you like two lovers out for a stroll?” Pattis asked the jury. Doe testified that she went to a sexual assault counseling center following the alleged incident and then to a hospital to be tested for venereal disease. Hospital photos of bruises on Doe’s legs were shown in court. “What transformed that night from happy into a nightmare was she miscalculated her own tolerance for alcohol,” Supervisory Assistant State’s Attorney Michael Pepper said in his closing arguments. “She ate too little and drank too much. But that’s not criminal. And it doesn’t absolve the defendant,” he said. In his closing argument, Pattis drew attention to Doe’s outfit that night, a “short skirt and tube top,” and suggested she was “dressed to party.” “She made up this story because she can’t face the fact that the one night when she took a walk on the wild side, she’s got to face her friends the next day,” Pattis said. “I think she let her friends convince her she’d been raped.” A representative for the prosecutor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trials over alleged sexual assault on campus may become even less frequent under Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who last year ordered her department to roll back Obama-era rules that aimed to reform systemic mishandling of such cases under Title IX. (Title IX requires the Department of Education to protect students from gender-based discrimination, including sexual harassment and assault.) The department’s Office of Civil Rights also issued a memo last July instructing staff to scale back their investigations at public schools and universities, including in sexual assault cases. ",he,said,concert
"On July 25 the journal Nature published an article about the ""Economic time bomb"" that is slowly being detonated by Arctic warming. Gail Whiteman of Erasmus University in the Netherlands, and Chris Hope and Peter Wadhams of the University of Cambridge suggest -- based on economic modeling that the ""release of methane from thawing permafrost beneath the East Siberian Sea"" would come with an ""average global price tag of $60 trillion."" The news should have sent a shock wave through the media. But instead, predictably, the public were encouraged to celebrate -- again and again, and again -- the birth of the royal son. My first encounter with methane release in the Arctic was in early August 2006. It was a grey, cold day along the Beaufort Sea coast in Alaska. Iñupiaq conservationist Robert Thompson and I were walking along the northwest corner of Barter Island when we came across a rather ghastly scene: an exposed coffin with human bones scattered around it. The permafrost (frozen soil) had melted away and exposed the coffin. Robert speculated that a grizzly bear broke open the coffin and scattered the human remains. What we didn't see, however, is the methane that was released from thawing of the permafrost.  Permafrost melted away and exposed the coffin, Barter Island, Alaska. Photo by Subhankar Banerjee, August 2006. Methane (CH4) is a greenhouse gas that causes global warming and is more than twenty times more potent than CO2. Large amount of methane is stored in the Arctic -- both terrestrial and subsea. It is released in two ways: when permafrost on land thaws from warming, the soil decomposes and gradually releases methane. In the seabed, methane is stored as a methane gas or hydrate, and is released when the subsea permafrost thaws from warming. The methane release from the seabed can be larger and more abrupt than through decomposition of the terrestrial permafrost. In 2007, the extent of summer sea ice in the Arctic Ocean hit a record low -- 30 percent below average. This event spurred a study by scientists from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSID) in Boulder, Colorado. The team used climate models to understand if the ""unusually low sea-ice extent and warm land temperatures were related."" In 2008 they published results from their study in Geophysical Research Letters. They found: ""The rate of climate warming over northern Alaska, Canada, and Russia could more than triple during periods of rapid sea ice loss ... The findings raise concerns about the thawing of permafrost ... and the potential consequences for sensitive ecosystems, human infrastructure, and the release of additional greenhouse gases [CO2 and CH4]."" This was alarming news because Arctic permafrost holds ""30 percent or more of all the carbon stored in soils worldwide."" In reality, the Arctic sea ice is continuing to retreat at a rapid pace. The August-September sea ice extent in the Arctic Ocean had set a new record low last year: 18 per cent below the previous record of 2007. As permafrost thaws, ponds connect with the groundwater system, which lead to drying of streams, lakes and wetlands. Permafrost thawing also accelerates rates of contaminant transfer that have toxic effects on aquatic plants, fish and other animals, and also increases transfer of pollutants to marine areas. This affects not only wildlife, but also indigenous peoples who depend on fish and other animals for subsistence resources. The NCAR-NSID team found that the terrestrial permafrost was indeed melting in the real world: ""Recent warming has degraded large sections of permafrost, with pockets of soil collapsing as the ice within it melts. The results include buckled highways, destabilized houses, and ""drunken forests"" of trees that lean at wild angles.""  Drunken Forest of larch trees, upper Kolyma River valley, Yakutia, Siberia. Photo by Subhankar Banerjee, November 2007. In November 2007, Robert Thompson and I had seen large areas of ""drunken forests"" in Eastern Siberia, not far from where Stalin's Gulag camps were, along the Kolyma River valley. About the subsea methane release in the Arctic, I'm aware of only two studies: the decade-long and ongoing Shakhova-Semiletov climate science study in Eastern Siberia, and the Whiteman-Hope-Wadhams economic modeling that was published last week. Soon I'll talk about both studies, but first a short journey through dystopia in a climate ravaged Earth. Dystopia is the antithesis of utopia, and is usually framed with literary imaginations. ""An imagined place or state in which everything is unpleasant or bad, typically a totalitarian or environmentally degraded one,"" according to the Oxford Dictionary. Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four is a good example. But it doesn't have to be literary imaginations only, it can be visual imaginations as well; and it doesn't have to be about the future, it can also be about the present, as Spanish painter Francisco Goya made evident in his print series The Disasters of War (1810-1820). Susan Sontag observed in Regarding the Pain of Others: ""The ghoulish cruelties in The Disasters of War are meant to awaken, shock, wound the viewer. Goya's art, like Dostoyevsky's, seems a turning point in the history of moral feelings and of sorrow -- as deep, as original, as demanding. With Goya, a new standard for responsiveness to suffering enters art."" Art historians have suggested that Goya created the series ""as a visual protest against the violence of the 1808 Dos de Mayo Uprising, the subsequent Peninsular War of 1808-14 and the setbacks to the liberal cause following the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in 1814."" Goya kept both his intentions and the 82 prints he created private during his lifetime. It was finally published in 1863, thirty-five years after his death, when it was deemed ""politically safe to distribute a sequence of artworks criticising both the French and restored Bourbons."" Is it possible that climate change experts in the U.S. are keeping their feelings private and not speaking out with outrage against Obama's petro-imperial and pro-coal energy policy -- for the fear of--...? Emission vs. Extraction On July 22 the Yale Environment 360 published an article in which nine climate change experts, including Michael Mann, Bill McKibben and Carol Browner gave their comments on ""Obama's New Climate Plan."" Eight contributors provided a more or less supportive view of the plan. The ninth contributor, however, a policy analyst from the Heritage Foundation, unsurprisingly took the discussion in the opposite direction, ""President Obama's climate plan would have a chilling effect on the economy."" For a more critical analysis of the Obama climate plan, you can see Chris Willams' article here and mine here. Broadly speaking the comments on Yale Environment 360 focused on emission reduction from coal-fired power plants and natural gas as a good ""bridge fuel."" No one mentioned a word about the ""climate time bomb"" that Obama had set off with his ""National Strategy for the Arctic Region"" in May. And no one said anything about the grave eco-cultural and climate consequences of -- his support for expansion of fossil fuels extraction -- across the American land and the oceans. It was a déjà vu for me. In 2010, the phony cap-and-trade bill had focused on emission reduction and was limping through the dysfunctional U.S. Congress, and then failed. To bring the focus back to extraction, later that year, I wrote an article on Common Dreams, ""Another One Hundred Years of Fossil-Digging in North America?"" Obama in the U.S., and Harper in Canada, in tandem, are turning North America into a petro-imperial and petro-despot continent. This does not bode well for solving the climate crisis. It's worth reviewing briefly some of the extraction projects taking place now. Since there has been a lot of discussion about tar sands in Alberta, I'll focus on a few others: On July 9 I wrote, ""In 2011 Obama sold the Powder River Basin in Wyoming to Big Coal. ... Precisely because of this greedy decision two years ago, today the activists in the Pacific Northwest are fighting the coal-port through which (if built) Wyoming coal would go to Asia."" And on July 25 Lynne Peeples wrote on Huffington Post that this coal project ""could create more national and global environmental impact than a Canadian company's proposal to ferry Albertan tar sands to the U.S. Gulf Coast via the Keystone XL pipeline."" Leah Donahey of the Alaska Wilderness League shared with me similar concerns that Obama's plan for drilling in the Arctic Ocean might have more environmental impact than the Keystone XL pipeline. Last week she wrote to me in an email: ""The President is still considering offering new drilling leases in the Arctic Ocean and Shell could be back at this time next year to drill."" My intention here is not to start a debate about which is the worst offender, but to point out that all of these mega extraction projects will cause massive eco-cultural devastations and contribute enormously to global climate change. After both their drill rigs, Noble Discoverer and Kulluk, suffered heavy damages and were cited for EPA violations, Shell abandoned the 2013 drilling plan in Alaska's Arctic seas. I wrote in a letter to the editors in the June 6 issue of The New York Review of Books, ""There will be calm in the Arctic Ocean this summer."" I was wrong. As it turns out, right now, instead of drilling, Shell is doing sonar surveys in the Chukchi Sea, using the Finnish icebreaker Fennica, to inspect ""ice gouges"" on the seafloor where Shell ""might build pipelines to offshore oil wells,"" as reported by Alaska KTUU-TV on July 23. With air guns and sonar equipments that Shell is using, the Chukchi Sea is certainly not calm this summer. The Iñupiat people of Arctic Alaska say, ""The Arctic Ocean is our garden."" On July 5 Robert Thompson, who lives in Kaktovik on Barter Island along the Beaufort Sea coast, wrote to me in an email: ""There were two deaths here that I attribute to climate change. Thomas Gordon and his son, Simon, were carried away by a big wave down the coast as they were crossing a low place on a spit. We never used to have such big waves. There is 700 miles of open water. With that, waves get bigger. When I first came here [in 1988] we could see the pack ice, all summer long."" Why are the climate change experts focusing only on emission reduction, and not on extraction reduction also, you might ask? It might seem paradoxical that while the US is trying to reduce emissions, it is also increasing extractions at the same time. I have a theory. A significant part of the extracted fossil fuels would be sent to other places around the world (like coal from the Powder River Basin will go to Asia) -- to make huge money. It will get burned somewhere and contribute to the global climate change. Emissions statistics, however, would show that America is reducing emission and is solving the climate crisis -- at home. It'll all look good on paper. Not so fast though. Two years ago Joseph Nevins pointed out on Truthout, ""The U.S. military is the world's single biggest consumer of fossil fuels, and the single entity most responsible for destabilizing the Earth's climate."" Now imagine: If the American military burns oil in a mission to Afghanistan, that was extracted from America's Arctic Ocean, would that be included in the accounting of American emission? I think not. If my theory of -- emission vs. extraction -- proves true, it'd be yet another example of American exceptionalism. You would think it would be logical to scrap the mega extraction projects if we are sincere about solving the climate crisis. It would indeed be, if we were living in a decent society. But instead, we're living in a dystopian one. Elements of Dystopia There are four elements of dystopia: ecological, political, sociological, and economic -- as it relates to climate change. Scientists from around the world have been using various climate models over the past three decades to predict the ecological future. At times, what's happening in the real world is proving to be more frightening than the outcome of the climate models. For example, the Arctic sea ice is melting at a rate faster than what the models had predicted few years ago. Polar bear mothers and cubs are dying from exhaustion having to swim longer distances in open water of the Arctic Ocean; lack of summer sea ice is forcing thousands of Pacific walruses onshore where they are getting crammed on narrow barrier islands, stampeding and crushing smaller calves; reptiles and rodents are getting burned alive underground by extreme wildfires in New Mexico; nearly 55 million piñon trees died during the last decade from bark beetles infestation in New Mexico; 19 firefighters were killed by a raging wildfire last month in Arizona -- are just a few examples of our current climate ravaged America. The future for the whole Earth looks much worse. This is what I'd call -- ecological dystopia. The ecological dystopia, however, didn't paralyze activists to fight for a better future. I was at the 2009 UN Climate Summit COP15 in Copenhagen. The official summit was a dismal failure. The unofficial Klimaforum, however, gave renewed energy to the climate justice movement. By fighting the political system, we had envisioned, it might be possible to move away from fossil fuels, and toward a clean energy future. However, less than four years later, it has now become clear that fossil fuels extraction is rapidly increasing with government support in North America. It will continue to be that way through the rest of this century, and perhaps beyond. And globally -- Russia, China, India, Brazil -- the story is the same. This is what I'd call -- political dystopia. We're already saying adios to one American coastal city: ""Goodbye, Miami."" Jeff Goodell wrote in Rolling Stone recently that Miami, and much of South Florida would be underwater by the end of the century due to rising sea level. The primary reason behind the sea level rise is the melting of the Greenland ice cap. Soon we will start saying adios to an inland American city also: ""Goodbye, Phoenix."" Drought, heat, fires, water shortage -- will make much of the American southwest uninhabitable. People would be faced with two choices. Those who can afford would move away to more habitable places (from Phoenix to Portland, or from St. Pete to Seattle, for example). But for most people, particularly poor people won't have a choice to move -- to a better place. The latter condition would be called, ""displacement without moving"" that Rob Nixon coined in his groundbreaking book, Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor (Harvard). Additionally, the American police state might use brutal techniques against millions of people who would become climate refugees, and would be forced to migrate. If you don't believe me read a bit further. Mexico (like southern Arizona, New Mexico and Texas) would be hit hard by climate change. It is likely that tens of millions of Mexicans would be forced to move North -- to the U.S. and Canada -- just to survive. The U.S. government is perhaps envisioning such a future scenario. I'd suggest that this is perhaps one of the reasons why America is spending tens of billions of dollars on -- not only building a 700-mile long ""Mexico-United States barrier,"" but also turning the border into a ""War Zone,"" as Todd Miller recently pointed out on TomDispatch. Globally the situation would be similar, as a South-North migration forced by climate change is inevitable. In the Arctic, communities are already being forced to move from their ancestral lands. Here are a few recent books on the subject of migration and displacement forced by climate change: Climate Change and Migration (Oxford), Climate Change and Displacement (Hart), Migration and Climate Change (Cambridge), Climate Change and Displacement Reader (Routledge), and Kivalina: A Climate Change Story (Haymarket). The tremendous social chaos that will arise from migration and ""displacement without moving"" is what I'd call -- sociological dystopia. The Whiteman-Hope-Wadhams study has brought to sharp focus, the fourth element -- economic dystopia. Shakhova-Semiletov and Whiteman-Hope-Wadhams Studies During the 1990s Russian scientist Dr. Natalia Shakhova had done studies of methane release from terrestrial permafrost in Eastern Siberia. In the fall of 2003, Shakhova and her colleague Dr. Igor Semiletov took the study offshore -- to the East Siberian Arctic Shelf. Every year since then, they conducted annual research trips, mostly on ships during summer, but also one aerial survey in 2006, and one winter expedition on sea ice in April 2007. They published their findings in the 5 March 2010 issue of the journal Science.  Methane release from the East Siberian Arctic Shelf. Credit: Zina Deretsky, National Science Foundation. Their research, for the first time, brought attention to the East Siberian Arctic Shelf as a key reservoir of Arctic methane that ""encompasses more than 2 million square kilometers of seafloor in the Arctic Ocean,"" and is ""more than three times as large as the nearby Siberian wetlands"" that was previously ""considered the primary Northern Hemisphere source of atmospheric methane."" Their findings showed that the ""permafrost under the East Siberian Arctic Shelf, long thought to be an impermeable barrier sealing in methane, is perforated and is starting to leak large amounts of methane into the atmosphere."" Shakhova pointed out that the current average methane concentrations in the Arctic is ""about 1.85 parts per million, the highest in 400,000 years."" The East Siberian Arctic Shelf is shallow, only about 164 feet in depth, which means that the methane that is getting released there, most of it is escaping into the atmosphere rather than getting absorbed into the water, which would have been the case if it was a deep seabed. Shakhova had warned at the time that the release of ""even a fraction of the methane stored in the shelf could trigger abrupt climate warming."" Shakhova and Semiletov now hold joint appointments with the International Arctic Research Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and the Pacific Oceanological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Their research is ongoing, and Shakhova is the lead scientist for the Russia-US Methane Study. I pointed out earlier that the rapid loss of summer sea ice in the Arctic Ocean is a key contributor to -- thawing of terrestrial permafrost. It is also a key contributor to -- thawing of the subsea permafrost in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf. With all these background information, I'm finally ready to discuss the Whiteman-Hope-Wadhams study. Arctic nations, including the U.S., Russia, Canada, Norway, Denmark, as well as some non-Arctic nations, including China and India -- are eyeing on the Arctic Economic Prize: ""oil and gas"" underneath the Arctic seabed. It is estimated that the Arctic Ocean contains 13 percent of undiscovered oil and 30 percent of undiscovered gas. These nations are also working to open up the Arctic sea route for moving all that crude around. It's a great irony that the rapid melting of the summer sea ice is making the Arctic Ocean accessible for extraction and shipping. Whiteman, Hope, and Wadhams point out that this frenzy for short-term profit is ignoring the long-term huge ""economic impacts of a warming Arctic."" By using modeling they tried to understand the global economic impact of methane release from the East Siberian Arctic Shelf. Referring to the Shakhova-Semiletov study, Whiteman, Hope, and Wadhams write: ""A 50-gigatonne (Gt) reservoir of methane, stored in the form of hydrates, exists on the East Siberian Arctic Shelf. It is likely to be emitted as the seabed warms, either steadily over 50 years or suddenly."" They use ""a decade-long pulse of 50 Gt of methane, released into the atmosphere between 2015 and 2025"" as input to the PAGE09 economic model. They took into account ""sea-level changes, economic and non-economic sectors and discontinuities such as the melting of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets."" They ran the model 10,000 times under two emissions scenarios: low-emissions and business-as-usual emissions. The result is a shocker: a $60 trillion price tag for the global economy. That's just the beginning, because there is much more methane in the Arctic than what is in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf. Furthermore, Whiteman, Hope, and Wadhams write, ""The full impacts of a warming Arctic, including, for example, ocean acidification and altered ocean and atmospheric circulation, will be much greater than our cost estimate for methane release alone."" ""The economic consequences will be distributed around the globe, but the modeling shows that about 80 percent of them will occur in the poorer economies of Africa, Asia and South America,"" Whiteman, Hope, and Wadhams write. The $60 trillion number is astounding, beyond the comprehension of most human minds. It has the capacity to cripple the economy of many small nations, that are already stressed from global economic crises. This is what I'd call -- economic dystopia. Is anybody listening? Whiteman, Hope, and Wadhams point out that ""neither the World Economic Forum in its Global Risk Report nor the International Monetary Fund in its World Economic Outlook recognizes the potential economic threat from changes in the Arctic."" They also point out that oil and gas drilling in the Arctic Ocean will make warming worse, as gas flaring emits ""black carbon, which absorbs solar radiation and speeds up ice melt."" Is Shell listening to any of this? Certainly not! Is Obama listening to any of this? Certainly not! Like Shakhova and Semiletov, my engagement with the Arctic is also ongoing. Over the past fourteen years I met so many wonderful people all across the world who are working on various Arctic issues. I danced to Gwich'in fiddle music in Arctic Village, and to Iñupiat drumming in Kaktovik. There, I learned that singing and dancing are not just for celebration, but also to heal from past wounds, and to fight for a more just future -- for ""the diversity of life"" on Earth. But what should we do to move away from the state of dystopia that we find ourselves in, you might ask? No one has the answer, but many are offering ideas, are engaged in conversations, taking various actions.

"When American Conservatory Theater first announced plans to renovate the Strand Theatre on Market Street, its Artistic Director, Carey Perloff, was bubbling over with ideas about what a second performance space could do for the company. With an eye to having more opportunities to commission new works, Perloff hoped that the Strand's location (smack in the middle of the mid-Market Street renewal effort) would be able to attract a new audience of techies who might be interested in seeing what a new generation of playwrights was producing. Community outreach was also mentioned as a key ingredient in the Strand's formula for success. Perloff hoped this would include local high school students writing about their experiences as well as ACT attempting to encourage and help develop writers from some of the Bay area's minority and ethnic communities. Over the years, whenever I brought a younger friend to the War Memorial Opera House for the first time in his life, he would comment that ""This audience is so old and white it's frightening!"" A sad, but true observation for, despite all the propaganda used to sell the arts to the masses, opera has largely remained a conservative white man's art form. As a rule, productions of Turandot and Madama Butterfly don't flood an opera house with Puccini-crazed Asian Americans. During the 1980s, Michigan Opera Theatre attempted to make inroads among Detroit's ethnic groups by staging a series of minority-oriented operas -- Armen Tigranian's 1912 opera, Anoush; Stanislaw Moniuszko's  1865 opera, Straszny Dwor (The Haunted Manor); and Scott Joplin's second opera, Treemonisha (which was composed in 1910 but did not receive its official premiere in 1972) -- with help from the local Armenian, Polish, and African American communities. Although one wonders whether audiences who bought tickets for these events were sufficiently motivated to attend subsequent performances of the standard repertoire which lacked a similar ethnic appeal (most of M.O.T.'s ticket buyers were prodded into action by a sense of ethnic pride or some less-than-subtle pressure from their church congregations), at least they were introduced to a musical art form that was accessible on some cultural level. More recently, several Bay area theatre companies have eagerly presented new works by Asian-American, African-American, and Latino-American playwrights to glowing acclaim. Unfortunately, arts marketers who embraced the ""reefer madness"" philosophy of subscription sales often deluded themselves with the assumption that one experience would have the same dizzying, and life-long effect on a new attendee as a toke of marijuana does on an innocent teenager. As a result, I'm curious to see how well ACT's double bill (Monstress) based on two short stories by Lysley Tenorio will succeed in building any kind of lasting outreach to the local Filipino American community. Will Pinoys come back for more theatre? Or will this be a one-off kind of event. The two short stories which were chosen attracted two of the Bay area's more prolific talents: Philip Kan Gotanda and Sean San José. As actor/director/playwright San José sees things, the evening's common theme of ""a love not meant to be"" makes quite a bit of sense to him.  For Sean, Lysley's collection of short stories about the life of Filipino immigrants raises some important questions: What quickly becomes obvious is that these two plays are (a) labors of love, and (b) could each sustain about 15-20 minutes of cuts. Working on a handsome unit set designed by Nina Ball with costumes by Lydia Tanji and sound design by Jake Rodriguez, the two plays (which harken back to earlier moments in the 20th century) are wildly different, yet touchingly sentimental * * * * * * * * * * The evening begins with Philip Kan Gotanda's new play, Remember the I-Hotel, whose opening scene takes place in San Francisco's Manilatown on August 4, 1977. To the sound of angry protesters who are trying to save the International Hotel and police who are trying to get rid of the protesters, the audience witnesses two old Filipino men struggling to get themselves together so that they can leave the hotel. Suddenly, there is a flashback to earlier times, as a beautiful Filipino dance hall singer (Melody Butiu) lends crucial ambiance to the segments set in the 1930s.  Melody Butiu is the singer in Remember The I-Hotel
(Photo by: Kevin Berne) The plot revolves around the strange relationship between two Filipino immigrants:  Ogie Zulueta and Jomar Tagatac in a scene from
Remember the I-Hotel (Photo by: Kevin Berne) Starting off with no money and no worldly possessions, Fortunado was flattered when Vicente asked his name (something none of his co-workers in the asparagus fields had ever done). After Vicente insists on shortening the country boy's name to ""Nado,"" their friendship continues to develop. After a night of drinking, they return to Vicente's room at the International Hotel where, in a rare moment of intimacy, Nado kisses Vicente goodnight. Although Vicente may think nothing of returning Nado's kiss (and can't even remember it the following morning), that kiss means the world to Nado, a closeted gay man who is just starting to experience life in the big city. As Gotanda notes: ""I grew up in Stockton in the '50s and '60s with many Filipino Americans as neighbors. The older Filipino American men, the manongs, held a kind of special place in my imagination because they'd always be walking around with those stinky cigars they smoked and they all looked really cool. They were always so well dressed. All of that provided a world I wanted to go back and explore.""  Ogie Zulueta is Vicente in Remember The I-Hotel
(Photo by: Kevin Berne) Much to Nado's disappointment, Vicente soon begins flirting with one of the white maids at the Parkdale Hotel, Althea (Kelsey Venter). While Vicente and Althea seem fearless in their newfound love, the more conservative Nado is keenly aware of the dangers involved in a Filipino man being seen in public with a white woman.  Ogie Zulueta (Vicente), Nado (Jomar Tagatac), and Althea (Kelsey
Venter) in a scene from Remember the I-Hotel (Photo by: Kevin Berne)  One night, when Nado and Vicente are alone, Nado reminds his friend of their kiss. But Vicente has grown accustomed to having sex with Althea in one of the hotel's suites (as a maid, she has the keys to every room). Disappointed and disgusted, Nado goes for a walk on the Embarcadero. Impulsively, he calls the hotel to report that a mixed-race couple is using one of the suites for sex. Later, while Nado hooks up with an anonymous man, Vicente is viciously beaten by the hotel's security guard as Althea stands helplessly by.  Vicente (Ogie Zulueta) and Althea (Kelsey Venter) share
a moment of forbidden interracial love in a scene from
Remember The I-Hotel (Photo by: Kevin Berne) In discussing his take on Nado, Tenorio explains that: ""He really was just a character who came to me. But when I hit the final drafts, that's when I started bringing in some of those questions from the real world. Certainly, I've thought about 'Is this character going to be demonized because he is a gay character who is, in essence, committing an act of betrayal?' But it felt true to the story. While I could understand those concerns, maybe that's the luxury of writing now as opposed to writing this 20 years ago. Today there is more appreciation of gay life, gay culture, gay and characters. I don't want to say that I have a little more 'freedom,' but I can (a little more willfully) have Nado be the agent of betrayal in that story without worrying about 'Oh great, the one gay character is also the guy who screws the other guy over in the end.' The question becomes: Is this true to Nado's character? Is this true to the story? And I think it is. I don't think he sees it as an act of betrayal in the moment, but he certainly realizes it as an old man."" As the play ends, the two men are being evicted from the International Hotel. Although by now, he can barely communicate, Vicente (who insisted on 'leading' back in the 1930s when he was trying to teach Nado how to dance) quietly gestures to Nado, indicating that he's ready to follow. Remember the I-Hotel, which has been poignantly directed by Carey Perloff, gives ACT's audience a chance to appreciate the craft of two of the Bay area's finest character actors: Ogie Zulueta and Jomar Tagatac. Robert Hand's lighting design adds a special sense of period to the play. * * * * * * * * * * Sean San José's adaptation of Monstress is a much more rambunctious affair in which he plays a Filipino filmmaker named Checkers Rosario (who has been pumping out Grade-B horror features like The Squid Children of Cebu, Bat-Winged Pygmy Queen, Werewolf Girl, and Coconut-Headed Bride of Coconut-Headed Dracula for Manila's CocoLoco Pictures).  Melissa Locsin portrays the victim of the evil Squid Woman
in a scene from Monstress (Photo by: Kevin Berne) The action begins in the 1970s, just before Checkers gets dropped by an executive at CocoLoco Pictures. His girlfriend, Reva Gogo (Melody Butiu), who has also been his leading lady, is more than willing to stop making pictures so that she and Checkers can settle down and raise a family. Checkers, however, is no quitter. When an American producer named Gaz Gazman (Nick Gabriel) tracks him down and expresses interest in using some of the footage Checkers has shot in Manila for his American pictures, Checkers is easily swayed by the possibilities. He's also impressed that Gaz identifies his mixture of low-budget Filipino and American horror films as a new genre entitled ""Chop-Suey Cinema."" It doesn't take much prodding for the Filipino filmmaker to accept Gazman's offer of a trip to California for himself and his girlfriend. Gaz soon explains that they will actually be landing in San Jose (which is nowhere near Hollywood). Why? Because Gaz lives in San Mateo and films his movies on the styrofoam sets he has built in the basement of his mother's house in Colma.  In a scene from Monstress, Gaz Gazman (Nick Gabriel)
films a scene with Reva Gogo (Melody Butiu) about a space
odyssey in which his spaceship is actually a Coke bottle
(Photo by: Kevin Berne) There is much to admire in the performances by Sean San José as a narcissistic Filipino low-budget filmmaker; Nick Gabriel as his American counterpart, Gaz Gazman; and Melody Butiu as the long-suffering Reva Gogo. However, the real strength of Monstress lies in the creation of a Greek-style Pinoy chorus consisting of two very swishy Filipino cinephiles -- Mata (Jomar Tagatac) and Dala (Olgie Zulueta) -- and their movie-loving fag hag, Tala (Rinabeth Apostol). It's a brilliant twist on an ancient narrative device that works beautifully under the circumstances.  Ogie Zulueta (Dala), Jomar Tagatac (Mata), and Rinabeth Apostol (Tala)
are a Filipino chorus of cinephiles in Monstress (Photo by: Kevin Berne)  To read more of George Heymont go to My Cultural Landscape",which,attracted,talents
"By Meghan Hudson, Financial Counselor, New York Legal Assistance Group Death and taxes, they say, are the only certainties in life, so perhaps it should come as no surprise that being victimized by a taxpayer fraud scheme is becoming more common. These lucrative schemes are increasing in number and complexity around the world. Many of the scammers pressure taxpayers to make immediate payments and threaten license suspension, deportation or arrest if they don’t. Their sophisticated methods can be very convincing. This summer we had a client fall prey: she lost $3,500 of her savings to a fraudster via iTunes Gift Cards. She is one of many who were defrauded and certainly won’t be the last. Meanwhile, the Internal Revenue Service announced in April that it has hired private debt collection companies to collect past taxes (despite two failed attempts at privatizing tax debt collection in the past), adding a new wrinkle and making it more difficult to know what’s real and what’s a scam. And, as reported last week in the New York Times, a group of Democratic senators have found that the IRS’s private collectors are using tactics that are not just high-pressure, but may be illegal. The article describes training scripts that suggest that debtors use 401(k) funds, home loans and credit cards to pay off their overdue taxes. Pushing taxpayers to the limit like this can have dire consequences. There are other options that we’ll discuss below. Both fraudsters and IRS contractors have the same goal: they want your money – and they have little incentive to deal fairly with people who legitimately cannot afford to pay their taxes.  The following are steps you can take to determine whether you are dealing with a real IRS debt or a scammer, and what your options are if it’s legit. There are only four debt collection agencies that can collect IRS debt: CBE, ConServe, Performant and Pioneer. Unlike the scammer, the IRS will inform you first by mail of the tax debt and indicate the debt collector assigned to your case. Only then will you get a call. If you are contacted by anyone who is not affiliated with one of these companies, you are at risk of being defrauded. If you owe back taxes, you will need to pay them, but make sure you’re really paying your tax debt and not lining the pocket of a scam artist. Keep some things in mind. The IRS-approved debt collection companies will NOT ask for a payment via iTunes or other gift cards, or prepaid debt cards. Payments and checks should only be made be payable to the U.S. Treasury and sent directly to the IRS regardless of what collection agency you are working with. You can also pay online at www.IRS.gov/PayYourTaxBill. You have the right to work with the Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) and to get a financial analysis of your economic situation in order to assess proper payment options. The IRS must take basic living expenses into consideration when determining ability to pay. The average monthly Allowed Living Expenses in New York City, for example, is $3,132 for a single person household. But, keep in mind that private debt collection companies are not required to refer hardship accounts to the TAS and are free to try to collect on debt that would otherwise be uncollectable by the IRS. If you can’t afford the payment, call the TAS yourself or visit their website. A TAS Taxpayer Advocate can put you on a payment plan that is affordable based on your income. The debt collectors tasked with collecting IRS tax debt must follow the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. The IRS must inform you of the debt that will be transferred and to whom. They can’t engage in harassing or abusive practices. To make a complaint about a private collection agency or report misconduct by its employee, call the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) hotline at 800-366-4484 or visit www.tigta.gov. You have a right to know how much you owe in taxes and how the amount was calculated. You can call the TAS at 800-829-1040 or go online to https://taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/ and create a Secure Access Account on the IRS website. In the tax account tools page you can see 18 months of payment history, the balance for each tax year that you owe and the payoff amount. Don’t ask the person on the phone to validate it, make sure it’s correct with the IRS. While you are sorting out your situation – and your options, do not agree to a payment plan that you can’t afford. Do not live off your credit cards or withdraw money from your retirement savings to pay off the tax debt. (This is often taxed as income and if you’re under 59.5 years old there are additional ramifications, such as early withdraw fees.) According to the same New York Times article, a recent analysis found that nearly a quarter of the accounts involved taxpayers with below-poverty level wages, and more than half were taxpayers with incomes of less than 250 percent of the poverty level. If you have an economic hardship, the TAS can place you into a status known as Currently Not Collectible which means that the IRS will stop trying to collect the debt from you and won’t garnish wages – though your tax debt will continue to accumulate interest and penalties. The TAS can also approve Offer in Compromise plans, an agreement to settle the debt for less than the full amount. It’s better to work with a Taxpayer Advocate to get on a payment plan that allows you to still cover your basic needs. I suggest you create a budget before creating a payment plan and see how much you can afford to pay. If you don’t qualify for either program you can work with a TAS advocate to create a longer installment plan so that your monthly payments are affordable. In summary, when it comes to calls related to tax debt don’t be bullied into making an immediate payment. Validate the debt and take a realistic look at your income. If you indeed owe the debt, you will need to pay it or a portion of it. However, make sure that you are paying a reasonable amount based on your income and that you’re not living on borrowed money or surviving solely on ramen noodles to make it happen. And don’t hesitate to reach out to your politicians and demand they promote policies that protect your rights. Private debt collection programs have historically wasted federal resources and violated consumer rights.",They,engage,practices
"It’s hard to believe that 92 years after the Scopes Monkey Trial (which debated teaching evolution in public schools), the integrity of the science community is in politically charged territory. The reality of climate change, possibly the greatest concern of the 21st century, is challenged by those who refuse to accept findings which indicate that the world is warming. There is an ongoing effort to refute that human activity has been a key driver in the “greenhouse effect.” For stakeholders in the fossil fuel industry, facts pointing to human-produced climate change is an impediment to their agenda. With greater fossil fuel carbon in the air, more heat is returning to earth. Arctic sea ice is decreasing, oceans are rising, extreme weather is frequent, birds and other species are changing their behavioral patterns. The new head of the EPA, Scott Pruitt, has maintained that the science of climate change is “far from settled.” What’s a scientist to do, beyond present the facts? March! Scientists and supporters of science will do just that at the March for Science on April 22, Earth Day. Science needs a higher profile in our country. Currently, studies show that America lags woefully behind in graduating science majors. Stats underscore that America ranked number 38 out of 40 countries. In 2012, President Obama set the goal of increasing STEM graduates by one million by 2022. Unfortunately, science isn’t considered “sexy.” When featured in news stories it too often doesn’t get the eyeballs (except glazed). That’s about to change — the tagline for the march is, “Science, Not Silence.” The organizers state: There are several core principles featured, with the purpose of bringing key positions to the forefront: The march is also looking to place the important work of scientists within the context of daily life. They want to contribute to a vibrant dialogue of ideas without retribution. Ironically, people throughout the country are not as disconnected from the scientific facts as might be believed. A Quinnipiac Poll from February 8 found that American voters are aware of the crucial environmental issues facing the country — and the world. Hundreds of thousands of science supporters have signed up to volunteer or participate in the Science March in DC and satellite marches are planned for other cities in America from Alaska to Arkansas, and globally from Paris to New Zealand. The best way for parents and their kids to ensure science will influence policy is to show up to support not only unfettered truth, but also to mobilize for the necessity of cutting-edge science education in their schools. Already, many in the education field have expressed concern about the belief system of the new Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos — on evolution and creationism. In this moment in America, families marching in resistance to President Trump’s morally repugnant anti-science, anti-environmental actions is what democracy looks like to protect our health and our planet.

"WASHINGTON ― Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), a prominent defender of President Donald Trump who has taken to threatening the Trump-appointed leadership at the Justice Department, got a meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Thursday about his subpoena for documents that government officials reportedly worry would put a top-secret intelligence source in danger. Nunes, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, and Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, met with Rosenstein at the Justice Department on Thursday afternoon. The issue on the table: Nunes’ request to see department documents as part of an investigation into what he alleges are abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. FBI and intelligence officials warned the White House last week that the information Nunes was seeking could put a valuable intelligence source at risk, according to The Washington Post. The source has reportedly provided information to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores told HuffPost that Nunes and Gowdy ― as well as Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), ranking member on the intelligence committee ― had been invited to department headquarters to discuss the matter on Thursday. She said Justice officials were willing to consider ways to accommodate the inquiry into information as it relates to that source. Nunes has threatened to hold Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who is recused from the Russia investigation, in contempt of Congress if the Justice Department fails to hand over the materials. He’d previously threatened to impeach Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray unless he got cooperation from the Justice Department. All three men are Republicans nominated to their current positions by Trump. In a statement after their meeting, Nunes and Gowdy said that they had a “productive discussion” with FBI, DOJ and Office of the Director of National Intelligence officials and that the officials “committed to holding further discussions of these matters” next week. It’s unclear how this will end. Nunes now has the backing of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who told reporters that the latest request was “wholly appropriate” and “completely within the scope of the investigation that has been going on a while with respect to FISA.” CNN reported that the White House has been closely involved in discussions about the dispute. Schiff told CNN that he believes Republicans “want to have a fight with the Justice Department.” Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation, is in a precarious position. The longtime Republican, who has come under repeated fire from Trump, has recently taken pains to praise the president’s approach to law and order. But in a fiery comment last week responding to news that a group of conservative lawmakers had drafted articles of impeachment against him, Rosenstein declared that the Justice Department would “not be extorted.” Certain unnamed people, Rosenstein said, “have been making threats privately and publicly against me for quite some time.” The Justice Department, he said, would “do what’s required by the rule of law, and any kind of threats that anybody makes are not going to affect the way we do our job.” Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering the Justice Department, federal law enforcement, criminal justice and legal affairs.

"As a female chemical engineer, Frances Arnold was already a rarity. After all, only about 16 percent of chemical engineers are women. But now that she has become the first woman ever to win the prestigious Millennium Technology Prize — it was awarded in Helsinki, Finland, on May 24 — Arnold is truly one of a kind. And she knows that in addition to a big cash award (1 million euros, or about $1.3 million), the prize brings an opportunity to spotlight the gender gap in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) careers and to be a role model for other women. ""I hope that my getting this prize will highlight the fact that yes, women can do this, they can do it well, and that they can make a contribution to the world and be recognized for it,"" Arnold told The Huffington Post in an email. ""I hope that women will see that one can have a rewarding career in science and technology."" Arnold, 59, won the prize for ""her discoveries that launched a field known as directed evolution,"" according to a statement issued by Technology Academy Finland, the organization that awards the prize. To learn more about the field, and about Arnold herself, HuffPost Science posed a series of questions to her via email. Here, lightly edited, are her answers: Did you always want to be a scientist? I did not choose to become a researcher until I was almost 30. I tried other careers, but science spoke to me more and more, especially after I started studying the biological world and all the amazing molecular machines made by nature. As a little girl, I thought I might be a heart surgeon, CEO of a multinational company or even a diplomat some day (until I figured out I had no diplomatic skills). When I went to college, I never really thought about being a scientist or an engineer, but of course that was always on the list of possibilities. I had tried lots of odd jobs — from taxi driver to waitress to assembling electronic devices — and later a few science and technology jobs in nuclear power and solar energy. But I loved languages, I enjoyed economics, I spent every break traveling and seeing different cultures. I loved learning and did not think too much about the future until one day it happened! Why do women continue to be underrepresented in engineering and other STEM fields? Because talented women choose to do other things. But if they knew how important technology is for supporting our well-being and that of the planet, and how fun it can be, more would choose STEM fields. What barriers keep women from choosing STEM careers? I believe that some women still face external barriers, but other barriers are more self-imposed: lack of confidence or desire to compete and a misunderstanding of what science and technology can contribute to society. Science is not for everyone; it takes a lot of time and devotion to become really good, and the same is true for engineering. You have to love it. What I see is that the most talented women have many opportunities. Whether they choose to pursue science or engineering depends on how they feel about their whole life experience, perhaps more so than men. Opportunities today are excellent, but there are challenges to having a family and competing at the highest levels that women often feel more acutely. What can be done to eliminate these barriers? At the very least, girls should not be discouraged from using their natural talents in mathematics and science. Even better, they should be encouraged and praised. What's a typical workday like for you? Rich, never boring, something new and interesting every day. Full of brilliant young people who want to change the world. So now about your research -- what is directed evolution? It's a technology that allows us to reliably create improved proteins for a wide range of applications. Just as farmers and breeders have used artificial selection processes over thousands of years to create higher-yielding crops or pets that please us, we can direct the evolution of proteins to perform better in applications, from laundry detergents to green chemistry. Modern methods of DNA manipulation allow us to make iterations of mutations and artificial selection on a gene rather than in an organism, and to shorten the generation time to a few days. That way we can accumulate beneficial mutations in the gene that encodes the protein, making it better and better until it meets our needs. What makes proteins so important? Proteins are the workhorses of life, responsible for nearly all the interesting things we and other organisms can do. Just one (very important) class of proteins, the enzymes are responsible for turning food (for example, for some microbes this means sunlight, carbon dioxide, sugar, etc.) into all the materials and energy needed to support life and reproduce life. That’s pretty amazing chemistry, and we should learn how to harness that for our own purposes. We have already been using microbes and the enzymes in them to improve our lives for thousands of years, from making bread, beer, wine, cheese -- to, more recently, having laundry detergents that take stains off of clothes in cold water (thus saving significant energy), making fuels and chemicals from renewable resources or making drugs to treat diabetes. How does directed evolution differ from evolution as we commonly think of it? It differs from natural evolution in that it is directed by the researcher. Mutations are directed (by me) to a specific gene, and since the researcher has a goal in mind, it is also directed in that sense.  How is directed evolution being used commercially? Directed evolution has had big impact in the fields of drug synthesis. Many popular drugs, including the cholesterol-lowering drugs simvastatin and atorvastatin, have been developed with the help of directed evolution. The same is true for making consumer products (key ingredients for creams, laundry detergents, animal and human nutrition products and many more) and for making non-ethanol fuels like isobutanol from renewable plant resources. What are the biggest advances that have come from the commercial application of directed evolution? My former student and one of the first people to use directed evolution, Dr. Jeffrey Moore, and his collaborators figured out how to manufacture the diabetes drug Januvia using an evolved enzyme. Their process replaces chemical methods that were far from optimal, lowering the cost of the drug and especially the waste products. Their process won many awards, including the President's Green Chemistry Challenge. Many companies now incorporate enzyme catalysts into their processes. More will do so as we move to greater sustainability in manufacturing. A number of companies that make fuels and chemicals from renewable resources have used DE to optimize enzymes. Enzymes optimized by directed evolution are being used to make nutritional products for humans and animals, fuel from biomass and to test new drugs for toxicity. They are being used directly to treat human disease. Engineered enzymes are used in everything from DNA sequencing to glucose sensors for diabetes, laundry detergents and food processing. What do you foresee for directed evolution in the future? The wonderful thing about directed evolution is that it is both simple and general. Because the technology is accessible, it can be implemented in any laboratory. It opened up a new way for people to look at the inventions of the biological world and fit them into their own creations. So many clever people all over the world have taken this technology and done all manner of brilliant things with it, things I would never have thought of. This will continue in the future.  What are you going to do with all that prize money? I will use some of it to invest in work done at Provivi, a startup I cofounded with two of my former students, Peter Meinhold and Pedro Coelho. Provivi is developing the non-toxic alternatives to pesticides, which I think is such an important goal. Why so important? Pesticides get into our food, streams and rivers and cause all manner of harm. Imagine spraying a little bit of ""perfume"" in a field to confuse the insect pests so that they can't mate. If they can't mate they are not going to damage your crops. Wouldn't it be wonderful to do that instead of dumping highly toxic pesticides? Our hope is to make these complicated insect perfumes quite cheaply using enzymes. Is there a particular scientific question you're trying to answer? I am very interested in the evolution of novelty — how do new functions appear in the biological world. I am tackling this question by evolving enzyme catalysts that catalyze chemical reactions not known in the biological world.",it,loved,day
" At a few weeks old, Susie became deathly ill with distemper and an upper respiratory infection. She was abandoned by her previous owners and was forced to fend for herself. Miraculously, not only did she survive her condition, she found the perfect home.   Here is Susie's story.   Sandra, a board member and foster of the Southern California Siamese Rescue, took Susie to the veterinarian where she was officially diagnosed with distemper, an extremely contagious viral infection. Feline distemper, also called Feline panleukopenia virus, is spread through contact with contaminated bedding, dishes, clothing, shoes or hands of handlers touching multiple cats. According to Petfinder, some estimates say only 1 in 10 affected by the virus survive. For two weeks, Susie's life was in jeopardy. Even though she nearly died twice, the cat rallied back after each scare. Susie was one of the lucky ones. She recovered from the distemper, although her upper respiratory infection will always affect her sinuses, making her congested and weepy. Having gone through so much with Susie, Sandra was unwilling to part with her. In addition, Sandra's husband Jock had fallen in love with the cat. Twelve years later, Susie is still with Sandra and Jock. Although the sickness stunted Susie's growth, making her resemble a ""sausage,"" her family loves her no matter what she looks like.

"A documentary that premiered Wednesday at the Cannes Film Festival alleges that Whitney Houston was molested as a child by singer Dee Dee Warwick, who was her cousin and the sister of hitmaker Dionne Warwick. Kevin Macdonald’s “Whitney” dropped the bombshell revelation about three-quarters into the film, according to The Associated Press. Houston’s half-brother Gary Garland was first to tell Macdonald of the abuse, and said he was molested as well, the director told Indiewire. Pat Houston, who was Houston’s sister-in-law and manager, corroborated the claim. Macdonald said Houston’s aunt and longtime assistant Mary Jones later provided additional details of the abuse, which she said Houston had confided to her. It was Jones’ interview that changed the direction of the film at the last minute. “She told me Whitney’s point of view on this, and what Whitney had told her in detail, and how important she felt it was for understanding Whitney, but how scared everyone was to talk about it,” Macdonald told Deadline. “So, yeah, the film changed radically in the last weeks of editing it, which I guess, as a detective, is the result you want.” Jones says in the film that the abuse filled Houston with shame. The director said he believes the revelation will add understanding to Houston’s difficult life before her death in 2012 at age 48 from what was ruled an accidental drowning in a bathtub. “I think it will impact her legacy in a positive way because I hope that it will make people feel like I’m not going to dismiss her as this drug-addicted, tabloid, ne’er do well, low-class person,” Macdonald explained. “By understanding, you humanize. I didn’t start this as a great Whitney Houston fan, but I ended up with a credible sense of empathy for her, and a love of the music born out of that empathy.”  Dee Dee Warwick, a two-time Grammy nominee and backup singer for Aretha Franklin and others, died in 2008 at age 63. Dionne Warwick’s representatives didn’t immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.",what,said,bathtub
"John Nation just wanted to give teenagers in Bristol, southwest England, a safe place to spray-paint without fear of arrest and prosecution. Little did the then 21-year-old youth worker know back in 1984 that his “Aerosol Art Project” at the Barton Hill Youth Center would go some way to shaping British and global street art over the coming years and decades. It spawned an entire generation of influential and genre-defining artists ― including Banksy. But as Nation, now 54, told HuffPost in a wide-ranging interview, the initiative also almost ended up costing him his job, his reputation and his liberty. Nation was just 18-years-old when, in 1981, he became an outreach worker at the youth center in his home neighborhood of Barton Hill. “We helped kids deal with the nitty gritty of life [...] providing sexual health awareness, talking about drugs, that kind of thing,” he told HuffPost. A trip to Amsterdam in 1982 sparked an interest in graffiti, which he saw adorning the Dutch capital’s streets. “I started reading whatever material I could.” Coincidentally, some of the 14 to 19-year-olds attending the center were also becoming interested in the art form. Inspired by movies such as “Wild Style” and “Beat Street” and the painting of Bristol’s earliest-recognized graffiti artist 3D (a.k.a. Robert Del Naja from Massive Attack), Nation said they’d spend hours copying outlines of the work featured in the seminal book “Subway Art.” When one teen returned from New York City with photographs of the graffiti he’d seen, Nation allowed the teen and his friends to paint the club’s front wall. “Barton Hill was rough,” Nation said. “At that time the club was very territorial, seen as right wing, predominantly white and very hostile to outsiders.” Its exterior walls, he said, were mainly daubed with anti-authority slogans such as “No Police State in Barton Hill” or ones promoting the far-right movement, the National Front. “These guys produced a piece that was so vibrant,” Nation said. “It helped break down some barriers. Lots of these guys listened to hip hop, reggae and black-inspired music. Lots of the artists they looked up to were black, hispanic and Puerto Rican, but they were in a predominantly white area. Being involved in graffiti opened their eyes and helped to lower their prejudices.” Inspired by what the teens had produced, Nation sought permission from his employers at the now-defunct Avon County Council authority to set up the “Barton Hill Aerosol Art Project” — a place he envisioned would let the youngsters, some of whom were only a bit younger than him, to “express themselves freely and legally” on the center’s walls instead of tagging or painting unauthorized spots on public or private property which could lead to their arrest. Cheo and Inkie were among the first generation of budding street artists to attend the center, which had the added appeal of being the only one in the city with an indoor skate ramp. Before long, the artists covered most of the building with their work. “Once word got out that it was a safe environment to paint and look at books and photographs and watch films about graffiti, then people from across the city started coming,” Nation said. “Once you had that one group of people give it their seal of approval, others saw it was safe and followed suit.” At its peak, more than 40 youngsters regularly attended the project. Graffiti writers from across the U.K. also visited, and it inspired other authorities from around the country to launch similar initiatives.  “It was a great atmosphere, very expressive, very creative,” Nation added. “There was never any bad vibes or competition, none of that element. It was all about being a crew and a togetherness and I still think that’s true to all the guys who still know each other and paint now.” Not everyone was in favor of the project, however. Unbeknownst to Nation, from 1988 to 1989 the British Transport Police surveilled the center and several of its artists as part of a city-wide investigation into graffiti tagging and criminal behavior. John Nation Operation Anderson sought to profile graffiti artists suspected of criminal damage and culminated with a series of raids on properties across the region. Police arrested dozens of people, including Nation. Officers searched his home and the center. “Bearing in mind that I was running an aerosol art project, there was no way there wasn’t going to be any material at the center,” he said. “It was like an Aladdin’s Cave for them.” Police seized a “massive stash of paint” Nation had procured from the project’s sponsors and his treasured 5,000-plus snaps of graffiti he’d either taken himself or been sent by writers from around the world.  Nation believes police thought the club was “some kind of ‘Axis of Evil’ that was the main meeting point for all of Bristol’s illegal graffiti writers and a place where other writers from across the country would come.”  “It wasn’t that at all though,” he said, although he acknowledges some of the artists were painting on unauthorized spots on their own.  As was revealed in the BBC documentary “Drawing The Line,” (above), police matched tags on the artwork in the club to tags on illegal works across the city.  They charged several artists with criminal damage. Nation himself was charged with suspicion of conspiracy to incite individuals to commit criminal damage.  “Their main case against me was that the photos and books I had, if shown to a young person of impressional age, would incite them to go out and commit criminal damage,” Nation said. “They also said I was covering up for the young people and I was duty bound to divulge information on them. But I didn’t assist them whatsoever. I answered ‘no comment’ to pretty much everything.” Several artists were found guilty of criminal damage and received fines. Nation’s charge, however, was dropped on the day his trial was due to begin after prosecutors offered no evidence of incitement.  A post shared by John Nation (@johnnation) on Jun 1, 2017 at 8:53am PDT Nation says he then consciously used the subsequent press coverage to promote his project’s work and to argue that without a place to legally paint, “the illegal culture of the art form just gets reinforced.” Following the police raids, Nation says many of those involved in the city’s street art scene went “underground for a while.” “It was like they were regrouping,” he said. “Many of the guys arrested took a break, lessened their illegal activities, and some decided painting legally was the only way.” Nation says the publicity did inspire, however, a new generation of artists to begin visiting the project ― with one of them being Banksy. “As a young boy, he’d come to the center and watch people paint. He was heavily into hip hop culture, graffiti, and Barton Hill was where it was happening. Every weekend there was fresh work going up on the walls and people would exchange ideas,” Nation said.  “He says he called it his religious pilgrimage every weekend to go. Many of these guys had their own crazy, little dreams and he said what Barton Hill showed him was very powerful, that you could go on to follow those dreams.” At that time, Nation says Banksy (who despite multiple attempts and theories has never been officially identified), wasn’t producing the political or social commentary pieces that he’s since become globally famous for.  As part of a crew with some slightly older teens, Nation says he was “into graffiti and letterforms and writing.” He also didn’t stand out “as one of the graffiti writers you’d call a ‘top boy,’” nor was he using his “Banksy” moniker either, says Nation. “The Banksy thing came later.” Nation claims Banksy is “without doubt” the biggest contemporary artist in the world right now, but admits he didn’t foresee his rise to prominence during his early days of painting at the center. Instead, he believes Banksy truly began to make his mark when he changed his style and began using stencils. “Not only could he paint quicker, he could paint more locations and produce more work. He started off with quite crude stencil work, like the rats, then he started progressing to more clean work, more sharper,” Nation said. “These smaller stencils started appearing across the city and for me, it’s once he made that conscious decision to change the style of what he was painting and the content of what he was painting when he exploded,” he added. Banksy himself admits in his book “Wall and Piece” that his switch in style came when aged 18 transport police chased him through a thorny bush after spotting him painting “LATE AGAIN” on the side of a train. “The rest of my mates made it to the car and disappeared so I spent over an hour hidden under a dumper truck with engine oil leaking all over me,” he wrote. “As I lay there listening to the cops on the tracks I realized I had to cut my painting time in half or give up altogether. I was staring straight up at the stenciled plate on the bottom of a fuel tank when I realized I could just copy that style and make each letter three feet high.” Nation said that change led Banksy to “strike an accord with first and foremost the Bristol public, and then the British public.” “Lots of people who wouldn’t be into street art could relate to the simplicity and the fun and the characters he was painting. As he’s become more mature, the images and message have become more hard-hitting — he’s a clever guy.”  A post shared by Banksy (@banksy) on May 7, 2017 at 6:40am PDT Nation does question how Banksy creates some of his works, such as the “Brexit” piece (above) that he unveiled in Dover, southeast England, in May as a commentary on the U.K.’s referendum vote to leave the European Union. “Yes he painted it, but he’s got to have a team of people that set up the scaffold and he must have approached the people who own the property before that,” Nation said. “You can’t just rock up and set up a scaffold on the side of someone’s property without there being no questions asked. It’s a huge wall. It’s massive.” With so much history between Nation and Banksy, one may assume the pair remain close and in touch. When faced with the suggestion, however, Nation responded with a stony silence before changing the subject. While the legacy of the Barton Hill Youth Center often focuses on Banksy, many of the center’s other alum have also gone on to enjoy hugely successful careers. Jody Thomas, who in April gave HuffPost a helping hand in unveiling its new logo (below), has painted and exhibited his signature photo-realistic style around the world: But for him, it also all began at the center, which he first attended when he was just 15 years old after being encouraged by a school friend who’d described Nation to him as “outspoken, politically militant and not one to suffer fools.”  “It felt like I was being led to meet the leader of a despotic cult,” Thomas told HuffPost, adding that Nation “didn’t disappoint” when he finally met him.  “He immediately went through my school folder of work based around the comic art of 2,000 A.D. and classical painting and drawings,” he said. “I think he saw in me the opportunity to add a different artistic dimension to the club’s repertoire and left me to recreate on the walls of the club what I had on paper.” Jody Thomas Thomas credits Nation as being at “the forefront” of the street art movement at that time. “His energy and personality has garnered him an amount of respect amongst Bristolians on the level of any rock star or public figure,” he said. “For me, he is the ‘Darwin’ of street art in the U.K. and gave me a opportunity to express the art that spoke to me all those years ago.” The admiration is mutual. Nation still remembers the day that Thomas first brought in his work which was “totally different” to what was being produced in the club at the time. “I thought to myself, ‘fucking hell, this is amazing. He’s 15 and painting like this?’ I thought, ‘this boy is going to go far,’” Nation said. “At first he wasn’t accepted as much by the graffiti lads. Jody was into indie music and a lot of that music had dark imagery on its album sleeves,” he added. “He embraced that kind of artwork. He painted small pieces, then he painted these two black and white heads (below) and that was it. I have a lot of time for him. He didn’t stick to what everyone else was doing. He just wanted to be an artist and express his talents.” Inkie, a.k.a. Tom Bingle, also emerged from the center. He’s since worked as a head of design at SEGA and hosted his own shows across the globe. Recently, he painted alongside Shepard Fairey, the artist behind the “Hope” poster that came to define former President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign. For Inkie, Nation’s project acted as a vital “central hub” for the city’s graffiti artists in the pre-internet era of the late ‘80s to mid-90s. “Without this center and John’s support of our artwork, Bristol would not have had the scene it maintains today,” he told HuffPost. By 1991, however, Nation had become disillusioned with the restraints he felt the authority was putting on him and quit. “I was seen as being quite outspoken, left wing and a bit of a socialist,” he said. “But I’m proud of what I did back then. And the fact that people still talk about then and what I achieved for me is justification for what I did do.” Nation went on to forge a successful career in promoting dance music events across the U.K. and the NASS action sports and music show in Somerset.  With the explosion in the popularity of street art, which he puts principally down to the rise of the internet and social media, he’s since come full circle ― and now gives regular tours of Bristol’s scene via the WhereTheWall tour. “People from all over the world come, and no one tour is the same. Street art is here today, gone tomorrow. The art form is transient,” he said. In April, Nation curated his first ever solo show, “Graffiti Nation,” at Bristol’s Upfest gallery, the home of Europe’s largest live street art festival. He also worked with Inkie on the “See No Evil” art exhibition in 2011 and 2012, and remains a fierce advocate for spaces where artists can legally paint. He’s also set to feature in another BBC documentary, which will analyze the U.K. street art scene in the decades since Operation Anderson. Nation’s pedigree, knowledge and influence of street art and the genres that umbrella term encompasses have seen him nicknamed the “Godfather” of the Bristol (and increasingly British) scene. But it’s a label that doesn’t sit well with him. “I look back and I feel that all those years ago I was vilified and I could have possibly lost my job,” he said. “Then two years ago I’m being used as the face of Bristol tourism as someone who represents it as a progressive, cultural city. Who would have thought it?” “I get called the ‘Godfather,’ but I’m not. I just had a faith and a belief in these young people when no one else would give them the time of day,” he added. “I’m just lucky enough that i’ve been involved in the graffiti scene and seen it emerge. Bristol is not what it is because of me, far from it. I’m just one cog in the wheel, just like Banksy and all the others.” Check out John Nation’s Instagram, Facebook and the tour website for WhereTheWall.",teen,allowed,wall
"As a film maker , researching inequity and disparity for stories of strength and resilience is what I do even when not making films.  The last few weeks, I have been pondering over the impact of art on society. It started with the film, Hidden Figures, which did a fantastic job of telling the story of 3 acclaimed black women who changed history. The film had more of an impact than real life – so much so that inspired by the film, the US State Department created an educational exchange for women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). Living in the Silicon Valley, I find the San Francisco bay area a strange mosaic. The  world’s most innovative, bright and prolific people concentrate amongst our ranks, yet we fail to find the narrative of progressive parity. In a recent survey conducted by the New York Times, the gender lines are so drawn that men and women have still not figured out how to socialize with each other.  Gender roles are predefined in a manner that women increasingly operate in a world where they must go to extreme extents to make their voices heard.   The percentage of women in tech has plummeted in the past 25 years. Silicon Valley must face this issue head-on and reverse this trend. pic.twitter.com/yo69RQfAdP Do we have female substitutes for a Bill Gates or Steve Jobs? An important question to ask is: As technology takes over every aspect of human lives, how do we create role models for a new generation of girls and young women? For so many decades, women have not experienced the same career opportunities presented to men. Women, especially in STEM, are often sidelined because they are erroneously believed to be incapable of solving hard problems. Many such incorrect assumptions abound, are routinely made and propagated even amongst the most progressive of corporate environments.  Companies are engrossed in creating frameworks that limit their legal liabilities. They are far less focused on creating organic understanding of normal working relationships between men and women or promoting a natural, healthy interaction between the two sexes. It is extremely difficult to evaluate the health of our workplace culture because objectionable conversations rarely occur in the open.  Not so anymore. The last few months have shown that women no longer want to have these experiences swept under the proverbial rug. At the intersection of this revolt and a push back lies a work culture that still needs to be repaired. I have long searched for a solution for this adversity but private, closed door conversations, HR interventions and lawsuits are really just reactions to the symptoms – not a sustainable solution.  Thankfully, all hope is not lost! Some organizations are starting to rise up to make sure that women aren’t left to fill up the back row seats anymore. Just a few days ago, as I pondered over my dilemma, I came across a refreshing new perspective that is the brainchild of a San Francisco based non profit, Menina Kaj Femme.

Tom Steyer, the San Francisco based leader who leads the war on climate change will talk about renewable energy. Laurie Yoler, the founding board member of Tesla will share her thoughts on the future of transportation while Vinod Khosla, a preeminent venture capitalist will lead an open Q & A for the audience. Lauren Schmidt, representing DuiX (Dept of Defense Innovation Fund) , will lay out DOD’s investment priorities. Kate O’Keeffe representing Cisco’s hyperinnnovation lab CHILL will offer her perspective on bringing together diverse corporations and interests to generating ideas that will lead to breakthrough services, businesses and products.  Catering to the needs of a diverse, global audience and women in STEM, many other leaders will present their views including Ann Winblad who is a pioneer in VC investing, Tory Burch, the famous designer who also runs a foundation for women entrepreneurs, Anarkali Honaryar, the first woman parliamentarian from Afghanistan, Dru Ramey, the beacon of human rights in America etc.  The 2 days at WiSTEM this year will be exactly the conversation we want to have. A conversation about not being anchored in the past but building a cohesive future where men and women are both vested in the same outcome - economic growth and capacity building.   Where men and women are not segregated by arbitrarily defined capability but deeply entrenched in each others success, the lessons from Women in STEM Conference may show the path to end the gender war for women in STEM. The start of a new beginning. I am excited - see you there. ",lessons,show,STEM
"Sexual harassment and assault are forms of sex discrimination and they occur at alarming rates in K-12 schools. Recent reports like “Hidden horror of school sex assaults revealed by AP” and “Ending Sexual Harassment and Assault: Effective Measures Protect All Students” confirm just how rampant these problems are. The attention afforded to transgender students’ rights should also prompt us to broaden our understanding of sex discrimination, a serious problem for all students. Students’ civil rights are violated daily because schools are failing to fulfill their responsibilities under Title IX, a federal civil rights law.  Researchers, national gender equity organizations, and the CDC have provided sufficient data to demonstrate how sexual harassment and assault negatively impact K-12 students. Yet the public remains in the dark because these violations are under-reported by students, who have been forced to normalize sexual harassment, and by schools guarding their reputations. It’s not surprising that national studies show a glaring discrepancy between the small number of schools reporting incidents of sexual harassment and the large number of students saying they experience it.  Sex discrimination, sexual harassment, and sexual assault are community problems. Research shows that the majority of teenage students have been affected by peer sexual harassment but rarely seek help. Because schools frequently discount or dismiss reports of sexual harassment or assault, students are discouraged from reporting; many of these victims become perpetrators of sexual harassment. By failing to properly address sexual harassment, schools foster a climate where sexual harassment and assault occur. Sexual violence on college campuses and sexual harassment in the workplace occur because students are afforded ample opportunity to practice these behaviors in their formative years.  Title IX prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded educational programs. But few families understand the broad protections the law affords beyond ensuring equal athletic opportunities. After our tenth grader was raped on a high school field trip, we also had no idea that Title IX required the school to take specific actions. The nightmare of sexual assault was exacerbated by the school’s failure to implement Title IX. By the time we learned of our daughter’s rights it was too late for the required prompt and equitable investigation; by then the school district had acquired “alternate facts.” Betrayed by our school, we brought a US Department of Education investigation to the Seattle school district. Using the national attention our case received, we spearheaded a national movement to educate the public about sex discrimination in K-12 schools. From our work with families across the country and national gender equity organizations, we cannot overemphasize the urgent need for Title IX compliance.  With the Trump administration and Department of Education leadership, we cannot expect vigorous Title IX enforcement from the Department’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR). Since we can’t count on federal oversight we must compel compliance through community engagement. The solution requires a massive grass roots education effort to inform families, schools, and local organizations about schools’ responsibilities, students’ Title IX rights, and recourses when schools fail, we told the Washington Post last year. To fill this need, the national nonprofit Stop Sexual Assault in Schools created comprehensive free education for the K-12 audience, Sexual Harassment: Not in Our School! The streaming video and action plan model a collaborative effort where students work alongside parents and community organizations to create Title IX compliant schools. It follows a high school gender equity club strategizing to address sex discrimination, interviewing nationally recognized education, legal, and LGBTQ experts, and learning from counselors, advocates, parents, and peers. In one enlightening scenario, students watch San Francisco Unified’s Title IX Coordinator, attorney Keasara Williams, properly address a parent-actor’s complaint—an important model for Coordinators who remain largely untrained. One student concludes that, “When we make change at school, we’re changing society too.” When the school and local community implement the recommended actions, they will reduce the traumatic effects of sexual harassment and assault, ensure better outcomes for students, and address behaviors that lead to sexual assault on college campuses and sexual harassment in the workplace. Sex discrimination, in its many manifestations, is the 21st century civil rights issue for students. In these uncertain times, we must arm communities with Title IX education now.

" Ram Devineni has been thinking a lot lately about shakti -- a word that translates loosely from the Sanskrit to ""female power."" It's a transformative concept in a country like India, where the highest profile criminal cases tend to revolve around sexual abuse. The brutal gang rape in 2012 of a student in Delhi led Devineni to create Priya's Shakti, a groundbreaking comic book that aims to inspire empathy for rape survivors in readers. His moment of inspiration came during a conversation with a Delhi police officer, who seemed to blame the victim for her fate. Disturbed by the cop's view  -- essentially, that good girls don't walk alone at night -- Devineni set about trying to write a new cultural narrative. His book tells the story of Priya, a girl who is sexually assaulted, shunned and eventually finds justice with the help of Hindu gods. Comic books have long been the primary medium by which Hindu kids learn religious stories. To reach the next generation, Devineni turned to technology. Using an augmented reality app called Blippar, he embedded the book's images with barcode-like tags that trigger animation, videos, real-life stories, and other interactive elements when read through an iPhone. The digital creation has become a global sensation since its debut at Mumbai's Comic Con last December, garnering worldwide press and even Instagram love from Mindy Kaling and Hannah Simone -- actresses from across the globe who both share Indian roots.  A post shared by Mindy Kaling (@mindykaling) on May 14, 2015 at 12:16am PDT The visual that's spread on Instagram is similar to the ones Devineni is propagating on the streets of India. For Hindus, the imagery recalls the popular iconography of the goddess Durga -- or Shakti, as she is also known. As the story goes, Durga was created by the most powerful gods in the universe to defeat Mahishasura, a demon who managed to secure a boon that rendered him killable only by a woman. Mahishasura, a half-buffalo, half-human hybrid, assumed this made him as good as immortal. Durga, who rides a tiger and carries a colorful range of weapons, including a scimitar and a lasso, killed him anyway.  Devineni hopes to spread the parallel between Durga and Priya on the streets of India. Working with a non-profit community organization, he enlisted the skills of Bollywood sign painters who live and work in Dharavi, the sprawling, self-sufficient slum inside Mumbai. On walls inside the slum, they produced the comic's key image: Priya seated atop her own tiger, with a beatific smile not unlike Durga's. Because of their proximity to the works, the painters -- all of whom are men --  act as local ""representatives"" of the cause, Devineni says, fielding questions from local passersby and seeing that the paintings stay untouched. The filmmaker recently chatted with The Huffington Post about the power of the artwork to change minds offline. How did you find the muralists? We worked with a local organization that has an arts center in Dharavi and a long tradition of doing cultural programs and art programs. [Some] local artists in Dharavi were former Bollywood movie poster painters. They also do political campaign art whenever somebody commissions them to paint on the walls. We gave them the image of the comic book and we allowed them to interpret it. I came in and added augmented reality on top of that [by taking] a photo of the wall and then used the Blippart app.  Where are the murals? We painted four: three in Mumbai and one in Delhi.  As opposed to muralists in the West, Indian sign painters belong to what amounts to a guild. They're born into the work, and tend to be male.  Yes, it’s basically labor. It’s working class work. Our goal is to make more murals and eventually work with street artists, not just mural painters, who of course will be male and female.  Are the men who paint Priya aware of her significance? We tell them. They have to support [the idea]. Everyone in the community knows what they painted. They each have this distinct style. And people ask them about it. They become a representative for the mural, sharing what the meaning is. How long will the murals stay up? As long as possible. In India, local community boards decide how walls are used. They manage the villages, and we got permission from them to paint. The artist typically lives right next to his mural, so he makes sure it’s properly taken care of.   How will you know if the images succeed? We want to make this an iconic image, a reinterpretation of Durga, the ultimate feminist goddess. There’s always a debate or discussion that happens around the murals. People know it's an image representing Durga but of course they know it’s not Durga. So they end up talking about issues of female power and strength. Already, that's some success.",you,find,muralists
"Pyeongchang, South Korea, built itself a brand-new $109 million stadium to host the 2018 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games. And after just four ceremonial events ― including Friday’s opening festivities ― Pyeongchang is planning to tear the place down. Ironically, the idea behind tearing down the stadium is to keep it from becoming an immediate white elephant and ever-present reminder of Olympic excess. The Pyeongchang Games were supposed to be an example of modesty, a reminder that the Olympics didn’t have to burden its host with the record-breaking $50 billion price tag that accompanied the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia ― and that helped turn much of the world against the idea of hosting the games. But building a stadium solely to host four ceremonies ― none of which involve actual sports ― feels more like an example of how Pyeongchang fell right into the Olympic trap. This year’s Winter Olympics will cost an estimated $13 billion ― far short of Sochi’s cost, but still roughly twice what Olympic organizers originally estimated. That maintains an ugly streak for the games: Between 1960 and 2012, every Olympics, winter and summer, has exceeded its initial budget projections, according to researchers at the University of Oxford. The median overrun for the Winter Games, the researchers found, was 109 percent, which means Pyeongchang’s doubling of costs is right in line with budget reality. Pyeongchang has already warned the South Korean government that the final cost of the games will be too high. Last year, it threatened to slash its own contribution to the Olympic budget. Those costs rose, as they always do, thanks to largely unnecessary construction projects with little promise of future viability. Organizers built a brand-new ski resort for the Pyeongchang Games, for instance, even though its construction required the partial demolition of a sacred indigenous forest, even though the games have required shuttering other ski resorts, even though there’s little evidence the new site will be used once the Olympics end. Other Pyeongchang venues share similar legacy concerns. Five months ahead of the games, organizers had no plans at all for post-Olympic use of at least three other newly constructed facilities. On the eve of the games, they still don’t have concrete proposals for the future. The public justification for hosting these games, in Pyeongchang and across South Korea, is that the first Winter Olympics to grace the Korean Peninsula won’t just improve relations between the North and South but will also boost interest in winter sports and help transform the area “into an Asian winter sports hub.” But who can really predict the first, and the latter seems unlikely. South Koreans don’t much care for winter sports. In one survey last year, just 35 percent of them reported having any interest in the Olympics, and domestic ticket sales, even for the most popular events, have lagged well behind the normal Olympic pace. Previous Olympics suggest that the games’ ability to boost participation in sports is nearly as big a myth as their supposed economic and tourism benefits. Organizers of the 2012 London Games really pushed the “sparking public enthusiasm for athletics” goal. Surveys in the six years since have shown that participation in various sports has remained at best steady across the city, while a Parliamentary report last year found that rates of physical activity and sporting participation among children have actually declined since the end of the games. Concerns about cost and legacy have largely taken a backseat ahead of the Pyeongchang Games for a variety of reasons. The focus on Russia’s doping scandal has sucked up most of the pre-Olympic oxygen. A norovirus outbreak on the eve of the games and the unavoidable security concerns caused by Pyeongchang’s proximity to the North Korean border have absorbed much of the rest. What diplomatic role the 2018 Winter Olympics will play, now and in the future, on the peninsula and in the world seems to be the biggest potential story of the games. To Pyeongchang’s credit, the city seems ready and the venues complete.  There haven’t been any of the major hiccups that typically drive hysteria in the run-up to the Olympics. Indeed, these games feel comparably flawless next to the worries over excessive costs, threats to LGBTQ rights and environmental destruction that surrounded the 2014 Sochi Games; the demolition of poor neighborhoods, the collapsing economy and the lax preparations ahead of Rio de Janeiro’s 2016 Summer Olympics; or the already exorbitant cost increases and environmental problems plaguing Tokyo’s upcoming 2020 Summer Games. All the normal Olympic features are still present in Pyeongchang: the bloated budget, the environmental degradation, the empty infrastructure legacy. A costly new stadium that will open only four times before it’s ultimately destroyed. But excess and destruction have become such hallmarks of the Olympics, these hardly feel like problems anymore.",site,built,resorts
"Fox News host Sean Hannity ripped colleague Shepard Smith on Friday after Smith said that people working on Fox News “opinion” programs say whatever they want and provide “entertainment,” not news. Smith’s comments in an interview with Time Magazine published Thursday were a not-so-veiled dig at hosts like Hannity, who criticized Smith last year as “so anti-Trump.”  “They don’t really have rules on the opinion side. They can say whatever they want,” said Smith, a Fox News anchor and host of “Shepard Smith Reporting.” “Some of our opinion programming is there strictly to be entertaining. I get that. I don’t work there. I wouldn’t work there.” Hannity responded in a tweet that he is too a journalist and writes “REAL NEWS” (his emphasis). Smith is “clueless about what we do every day,” complained Hannity, adding that “Hannity breaks news daily.” He listed stories he has worked on — such as “abuse” of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act —  that would likely not change Smith’s opinion. While Shep is a friend with political views I do not share, and great at breaking news, he is clueless about what we do every day. Hannity breaks news daily-Warrant on a Trump assoc, the unmasking scandal, leaking intel, Fisa abuse, HRC lawbreaking, dossier and more REAL NEWS! 9p https://t.co/zJpnnyFTtP But Hannity himself is clearly conflicted about whether or not he’s a newsman or an entertainer. On his own radio show in 2016, he declared: “I’m not a journalist; I’m a talk show host.” That was his explanation after he was criticized for going too easy in an interview on then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. He told The New York Times the same year: “I never claimed to be a journalist.”  The next year, he said he was a journalist — with an explanation. “I’m an advocacy journalist, or an opinion journalist,” he told the Times. That wouldn’t fit Smith’s definition of a journalist. Laura Ingraham, another of the hosts on the Fox News opinion side of Smith’s ledger, also piped in with a dig at Smith, calling his comments “inconsiderate” and “inaccurate.” She said people on her program, “Ingraham Angle,” do “real reporting” and “score big interviews.” Always liked Shep, but his comments were inconsiderate & inaccurate.  The hard working team at the Ingraham Angle does real reporting, develops impt sources and scores big interviews. Very proud of them. https://t.co/3aR1EHAK3Z Smith announced Friday on “Shepard Smith Reporting” that he was taking a “previously planned” weeklong vacation, The Hill reported. He joked that when he returns, “everything will be peachy-keen and hunky-dory” — apparently in reference to the simmering feud with Hannity. He added: “I can’t wait.” “Fox News Sunday” anchor Chris Wallace, who was on the show with Smith, quipped, “That’s what they always say: previously planned and one week vacation.” Fox announced Thursday that it has signed Smith to a new multi-year contract as chief news anchor and managing editor of breaking news but did not reveal the terms of the agreement.",Hannity,breaks,intel
"LOS ANGELES, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Corey Seager’s sixth-inning sacrifice fly helped the Los Angeles Dodgers eke out a come-from-behind 3-1 Game Six victory over the Houston Astros on Tuesday to force a World Series decider. Seager’s deep fly ball to right field allowed Chase Utley to scamper home for the go-ahead run, igniting the sold-out crowd of 54,128 as the Dodgers tied the series up at 3-3 to set up Wednesday’s winner-take-all showdown. This #WorldSeries deserves a #Game7.The @Dodgers win Game 6 to push this one to the brink. pic.twitter.com/n8GAS4rSKR Dodgers center fielder Chris Taylor continued his clutch hitting in the post-season, tying the game 1-1 earlier in the inning with a double down the right-field line off of losing pitcher Justin Verlander. “I was just trying to put a ball in play,” Taylor said. “He’s really tough with that fastball up in the zone and a good slider. I was just trying to get the barrel on the ball and hope for something good and it worked out for me,” he said. Taylor has reached base safely 26 times this post-season, a franchise record. Dodgers slugger Joc Pederson hit a solo 373-foot blast in the bottom of the seventh to provide the National League champions with an insurance run, and reliever Kenley Jansen came in during the eighth inning for a drama-free six-out save. Do you like that #JOCPOP?! #WorldSeries pic.twitter.com/fF4VHye0OP The loss was the first of the post-season for the hard-throwing Verlander, who had a no-decision in Game Two. Dodgers starter Rich Hill was sharp but gave up a solo home run to center fielder George Springer in the third inning for a 1-0 Astros lead and was pulled with two outs in the fourth. Dodgers reliever Tony Watson, who came into the game in the top of the sixth inning and escaped a two-on-two out jam, was the winning pitcher. The defensive play of the game came in the top of the seventh when the Astros had runners on first and third with two outs, and second baseman Jose Altuve hit a soft ground ball to Justin Turner. The third baseman charged to pick up the ball and make a quick throw to first baseman Cody Bellinger, who took it on the hop to get the speedy Altuve and keep the Dodgers 2-1 in front. Game Seven will pit the Dodgers’ Japanese right-hander Yu Darvish against Astros curve-ball specialist Lance McCullers Jr. Darvish had a nightmare start in Game Three in Houston, where he could not get out of the second inning in the shortest start in his major league career. McCullers Jr had a solid outing for the first five innings of the same game before losing his accuracy in the sixth inning. Wednesday’s game will be the first-ever World Series Game Seven played at Dodger Stadium and will either see the hosts win a first title since 1988 or the American League champion Astros bag a first-ever crown in their 55-year history. GAME SEVEN. GAME SEVEN. GAME SEVEN. GAME SEVEN. GAME SEVEN. GAME SEVEN. GAME SEVEN. GAME SEVEN. GAME SEVEN.

"A recent survey jointly conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute and Religion News Service reveals that Catholics, more than any other religious group, have suffered the largest exodus from the church. While nearly one third (31 percent) of Americans say they were raised Catholic, just 21 percent identify as Catholic today — a 10 percent decline overall. The church’s treatment of LGBT people and the sexual abuse scandals clearly have exacted a heavy toll. Perhaps when we look back, the next significant alienation of Catholics might be traced to the church’s lack of moral clarity in relation to the politics of our time. Everyone understands that the Church, as a nonprofit, cannot intervene in any political campaign. Never mind that it has intervened conspicuously on marriage equality and on a woman’s right to manage her own body. The positions bishops took, through pastoral letters and through their alignment with those who fought marriage equality, and the Affordable Care Act, made it clear that they have long seen the Republican Party as the party of traditional marriage and the policing of women’s wombs. These remain the non-negotiable core issues of the Church. The shredding of the fabric of civility that should undergird our political discourse, the abandonment of adherence to basic norms of courtesy, and the self-confessed sexually predatory behavior of Donald J. Trump have not attracted the same kind of moral certitude from the bishops that we have heard often on reproductive rights and marriage equality. Guidance on voting The recent (Oct 21) issue of the Hawaii Catholic Herald has a full page devoted to the question “To vote or not to vote: How are Catholics, especially in this year’s turbulent electoral climate, to respond at the polls as voters in faith?” How is it even possible that in a state where voter turnout is exceptionally low, not voting is presented as an option? Dorothy Day is cited as an example of “one Catholic who opted because of principle not to vote.” Let’s be clear: Dorothy Day lived a life of intense civic engagement, including demonstrating for the right of women and African Americans to vote. Yes, Dorothy Day herself chose not to vote. But even people on the path to sainthood can be wrong on some things. The White House is in danger of being occupied by someone whose ideas are a toxic stew of racism, misogyny, xenophobia, narcissism and self-interest. We are called, Catholics or not, to do everything in our power to keep that from happening. We can wish that the options were better. But politics is about being pragmatic in dealing with the situation at hand, not opting out because our first choices are not available. In the interest of preserving democracy and the norms that hold our imperfect society together, we have a moral obligation to vote. Let’s not invoke Dorothy Day to opt out of our obligation to reject a manifestly un-Christian, un-American candidate who has stoked division and who has demonstrated repeatedly his capacity for denying his very own words and actions, even those caught on camera. Yes, his opponent is flawed –- but there is no equivalence here. As a Catholic who would have liked to be voting for Bernie Sanders, I have cast my vote for Hillary Clinton without a shred of hesitation. The alternative is too horrible, too immoral and too dangerous to even contemplate. Donald Trump disrespects life in every possible way: he derides the poor and the vulnerable; he mocks the disabled; he attacks Muslims, women, Mexicans; he celebrates dictators and promises to emulate their example by undermining democracy, encouraging violence and ignoring the rule of law. He has no time or capacity for the common courtesies and rules of decorum that come with high office or with just being a human being who has a conscience—because he appears not to have one. He rattles sabres and threatens revenge. How does Trump pass the Church’s litmus test of being “pro-life?” How do Catholics who say they are “pro-life” justify supporting a candidate who repeatedly and publicly rips the heart out of what the Gospel teaches, and who barely pays lip service to their faith? Earlier this year a group of conservative Catholic commentators signed a letter declaring Trump “manifestly unfit to be president of the United States.” Clearly, Catholics are doing more than just following the bishops’ election guide or choosing not to vote. They are letting their vote speak for Gospel values, their sense of decency, and their conscience with a clarity that has been missing from the bishops — and from high profile Catholics who stand with Trump.",Trump,pass,test
"A lot has been written about Pope Francis’s goal of making the church more democratic, with less control by the Vatican and more power to individual bishops. In an ideal world, not only would the Vatican have less say in choosing bishops, but priests and laity would have a larger role in the selection of their leaders. However, unless the institutional church actually reaches that goal, and power truly devolves to the grassroots, giving more autonomy to Catholic bishops might make things worse, not better, at least for progressive Catholics. While Pope Francis’s appointments of often have elevated reformers to power, he cannot replace every powerful leader in the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB). And the bishops now leading U.S. Catholics skew conservative. Indeed, in 2014, one bishop speaking on background confided that only about a third of American bishops were totally on board with Francis’s agenda, about a quarter were definitely against, and the rest were still figuring out where they stood. Not much appears to have changed in the intervening years. Consider, for example, Pope Francis’s approach to divorced and remarried Catholics who wish to practice their faith. The pope suggested that such Catholics, in certain circumstances, could receive Communion. In Germany, Argentina and Malta, Catholic bishops followed the pope’s advice. That did not happen here. Like Nun on the Bus Sister Simone Campbell, I don’t expect the bishops “to get a brain transplant.” They largely are old and white and set in their doctrinal ways. But I did expect U.S. bishops to have a sense of balance about the issues they take on. Yes, we get it. We know that bishops oppose same-sex marriage, contraception and abortion. But surely, they could agree with the pope that other issues are just as, if not more, important? Yet there is little to demonstrate that U.S. bishops have the pope’s back. For example, even though Francis has called protecting the planet a significant moral issue, we have not seen the bishops do “fortnights for the environment” the way their “fortnights for freedom” have for years inveighed against the birth control mandate in Obamacare. During the 2016 election, American bishops largely did not attack candidate Donald Trump’s “build a wall” remarks with statements that backed up the Pope’s concerns about the fate of the people the wall would shut out. As Washington D.C. Cardinal Donald Wuerl so aptly put it, immigration did not get to be a “raging issue” for the bishops until 2017, when they faced a president who intended to fulfill his campaign promises. We do not have to go back in time to see examples of U.S. bishops behaving badly. This month, Bishop Thomas Paprocki, who heads up the diocese of Springfield, Illinois, issued a “decree” concerning Catholics in same-sex marriages. The bishop did not mince words. He called such unions “objectively immoral.” He ordered his priests to never, ever, officiate or even offer any support to any same-sex marriage ceremony, and to deny Catholics living in same-sex unions the last rites, or a Catholic funeral, unless they had repented of their same-sex sins. He also stipulated that Mass-attending Catholics in same-sex unions should be denied Communion. Oh, the bishop will let their kids attend Catholic school, but with the warning that they will be informed of their parents’ scandalous misconduct. Then he has the gall to remind his followers that we must be “respectful” and “compassionate.” That’s like an ax murderer telling us to respect life. Marianne Duddy-Burke, the head of DignityUSA, which advocates for LGBT Catholics, termed the edict “unchristian and demeaning… totally unworthy of our Catholic faith.” One wonders whether the bishop ever treated any priest in his diocese who sexually abused minors with such disdain. Oh wait, we know what the bishop thought about priestly sex abuse. In 2007, he was an auxiliary bishop in Chicago, then wracked by its own abuse scandal and the lawsuits that followed. Paprocki blamed the victims for the church’s troubles, charging that “the principal force behind these attacks is none other than the devil.” Paprocki did not lose his position. In 2010, he got a promotion. Paprocki may be a particularly blatant example. But there were plenty of bishops, some of them who now are cardinals, who have shown a lack of compassion to the survivors of abuse by priests. Bishops have kept investigative reporters busy from Boston to Minnesota and  Los Angeles, and many other cities and dioceses in between. Sadly, the leaders of many dioceses looked the other way when they got reports of abusive priests, or tried to cover the scandal up, or fought victims in court when they sued for damages. They also lobbied against legislative efforts to make it easier to prosecute those who abuse children. Keep in mind that bishops even now have great power over Catholics in their respective dioceses, including the power to throw them out of the church altogether. That’s an awesome responsibility, and one bishops could have used to send a very strong signal that pedophilia would not be tolerated in the church. Yet, I am not aware of a single bishop excommunicating any priest for his crimes. (Pope Francis has excommunicated a few pedophile priests.) But after a Catholic sister and hospital administrator permitted physicians at a Catholic hospital to perform an abortion to save the life of the mother, she was harshly punished. When he found out what had happened, Phoenix Bishop Thomas J. Olmstead publicly declared the nun excommunicated. He only admitted her back into the church after she went to confession and agreed to resign from her post. So, no. I’m not excited about the prospect of bishops in the U.S. having more power. In fact, the more I think about it, the prospect is actually pretty terrifying.

"By Mikhail Zinshteyn As a college freshman, Hattie Mitchell visited L.A.’s notorious Skid Row neighborhood as part of a choir group and spotted a six-month old baby on the ground surrounded by trash and signs of prostitution and drug use. “And I just thought...this little girl has no idea...she may aspire to be something and the chances of that happening are slim to none just given her circumstances.” Mitchell soon found her life’s work: “The changing factor in my life was education, what will change her trajectory? Education.” Thirteen years later, with a doctorate in educational leadership from USC in hand, Mitchell on Monday will officially open a charter school she founded that seeks to help homeless families. It’s one of nine new independent charters opening within Los Angeles Unified School District this year, and the only one dedicated to fighting homelessness with an arsenal of social services to assist families ease into the workforce and away from the streets. The school, called Crete Academy near South L.A.’s Leimert Park neighborhood, has enrolled 140 students in grades transitional-kindergarten to 6th. Officials won’t know until after Crete opens how many students meet the state’s definition of homeless ― which ranges from living in shelters, temporary housing, motels, parks, cars or sharing housing with friends or relatives. Mitchell estimates that among the 140 enrolled students, 10 percent are or have experienced homelessness. She expects that nearly all students will qualify for free-and-reduced price meals — based on parent surveys and rates at nearby schools. While the school can just put a dent in L.A.’s homeless crisis — where even working adults are finding it impossible to find affordable housing — if it succeeds it could become a model for other districts to aid students and their families. Crete is serving some of the poorest communities in Los Angeles, and its location in South L.A is strategic. According to a 2015 analysis in Crete’s charter application conducted by the nonprofit research group The Economic Roundtable, the nearby zip code of 90044 was home to more than 7,000 children in 2010 who had experienced homelessness at some point in their lives — about a third of the zip code’s child population. Mitchell said a majority of the students enrolled at Crete live in 90044. “The housing scarcity is not only real in general, it’s very real for families,” said Mitchell. “We want to keep families together as much as we can. To do that we have to provide services not just at the school for the kids, but services that extend beyond the school day to our parents and our families.” Key to Crete’s whole-family strategy is the set of social-service partnerships Mitchell and her team have spent the past 18 months establishing. The school will have a wellness director and three AmeriCorps staffers who will connect students and families to health, housing and other care. Crete is partnering with the L.A. County-funded social-services hotline 211 to conduct initial reviews of the services for which each family is eligible. Those reviews will occur during the families’ meetings with Crete’s wellness team in the first month of school. Crete’s wellness director will use the information to plot an individual action plan and check in regularly on families to see how they’re faring. For families in need of housing, Mitchell said that the school is partnering with several landlords who specialize in low-income housing, including developer Thomas Safran & Associates. So that families requiring housing can afford it, Crete’s wellness team will assist them in securing government vouchers for subsidized housing known as Section 8. The idea is to have the partnering landlords settle them in stable homes — expediting the typical process for families who otherwise may have to wait years for an affordable apartment. In the meantime, Crete staff will work to place those with nowhere to go in temporary housing, like at Union Rescue Mission — the county’s largest with more than 1,300 beds and where most of the occupants come from South L.A. The hotline 211 will also assist in pointing families toward short-term housing options. “Hattie’s incredibly smart and her mission is inspirational,” said Andrew David Gross, president at Thomas Safran & Associates, in an interview. “And we look forward to working with her.” Overall, the county’s total homeless population has grown in recent years (even as the student homelessness population has declined by nearly 5,000 since 2014), and two voter-backed initiatives that raised the sales tax and approved bond issues will yield hundreds of millions of dollars annually to build new homes and provide social services to the area’s homeless population. To address the health needs of students, Crete is pairing with UMMA Community Clinic to provide families with Medi‐Cal enrollment, medical exams and referrals for dental and mental health support. USC's school of dentistry is another partner. Medical staff from the school will come onto the Crete campus to provide students and interested family members screenings. Crete employees will then help book dental appointments for students and parents in need of care. By connecting students and their parents or guardians with government insurance plans for low-income residents, Crete’s plan is to steer families toward services that cost them little or nothing at all. Crete is also about to sign agreements with USC and Cal State University Dominguez Hills to secure the services of a few graduate students studying to become social workers. Overseen by a licensed clinical social worker, the graduate students will offer mental and emotional support to Crete students, and will start in a few weeks, Mitchell said. Because many students and their families cannot pay for transportation, Mitchell said Crete purchased two 15-seat vans that will make multiple runs each morning to pick up the roughly 50 students who would otherwise be unable to get to school. For parents, Crete will host campus resume-writing and interview workshops, plus document preparation and even yoga classes. Los Angeles Trade Technical College, a local community college, agreed to offer workforce-related certificated courses for parents, if there’s demand. Los Angeles City Councilmember Marqueece Harris-Dawson, whose district includes Crete, said the school's emphasis on homeless youth ""makes sure that all of our kids can have an opportunity to live up to their fullest potential."" As a charter, Crete has received $575,000 in federal charter school start-up grants, various private donations and the standard state allotment for charter schools that's based on the school's enrollment. Mitchell, formerly a dean of students at another L.A. charter school, has served as chief of staff at the office of student programs within the Louisiana Department of Education. She founded the school with her husband, Brett Mitchell, a former law clerk who is the school's chief operations officer and Olivia Trujillo, a former massage business manager, who is the school's dean of students. Beyond the social supports, Crete’s curriculum includes life skills such as patience and mindfulness. Through an instructional program called ThinkLaw, students will discover learning strategies used by lawyers, such as quizzing themselves to gauge how much they actually know, considering alternative endings to stories and thinking about the sequence of events in their lesson plans. In addition to core subjects like math, English and science, students will attend rotating classes on horticulture, Mandarin and culinary arts during school hours, and have the option of taking those electives after school, too. Though Crete is officially opening next week, it has already generated buzz. While the school’s original charter petition to the district proposed grades transitional-kindergarten to second, community demand led approval to enroll through the 6th grade and enroll 140 students instead of the original 111 students. One of those students will be Mitchell’s own son. She and her husband moved out of the affluent city of Pasadena and into Inglewood this spring to live closer to the school. ""We want 50 percent of our population to be homeless and-or low-income. [But] the other 50 percent we want to be middle- and high-income,” said Mitchell. “We don't want it to be that homeless school. We don't want a kid to say, ‘Oh I go to Crete’ and everyone says, ‘Oh so you must be homeless and poor.'” This story originally appeared on EdSource.org",One,be,students
"Facebook has quietly developed a censorship tool that could persuade China to allow the world’s biggest social media network to re-enter the world’s second largest economy after a seven-year ban, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. Facebook developed the software, which suppresses posts from appearing in people’s news feeds in specific geographies, with the support of Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, the newspaper said, citing unnamed current and former employees. Zuckerberg in March met China’s propaganda tsar Liu Yunshan who said that he hoped Facebook could strengthen exchanges and improve mutual understanding with China’s internet companies, according to state news agency Xinhua. “We have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country,” Facebook spokeswoman Arielle Aryah said in an emailed statement to Reuters. “However, we have not made any decision on our approach to China. Our focus right now is on helping Chinese businesses and developers expand to new markets outside China by using our ad platform.” Foreign companies in China, especially in media, face political pressure from a range of regulations. The country’s military newspaper calls the internet the most important front in an ideological battle against “Western anti-China forces.” China, which has the world’s largest population of internet users, banned the website following the Urumqi riots in July 2009 in an effort to stem the flow of information about ethnic unrest which left 140 people dead. Though Facebook has developed the new tool, it does not intend to suppress the posts itself, NYT said. Facebook would instead offer the software to enable a third party to monitor popular stories and topics that gain visibility as users share them across the network, according to the Times. The third party partner would have full control to decide whether those posts should show up in users’ feeds. There is no indication Facebook has offered the software to the authorities in China, the Times said. It is one of many ideas Facebook has discussed with respect to entering China and it may never see the light of day, it added. Facebook, which has struggled in recent months to combat allegations that it unfairly removes certain content on its service, aims to continue to grow in developing nations where it currently has smaller penetration rates.

"The top-seeded Boston Celtics find themselves in a precarious position. It’s down two games to zero against a Chicago team that barely made the NBA Playoffs and seemingly almost fired its coach multiple times, and the blame for Boston’s woes has predictably shifted onto its boy-wonder coach, Brad Stevens. Stevens, 40, has dropped 12 of 14 games, accumulating the worst career postseason record of all time. It’s a convenient statistic for those pointing the finger his way. But the sentiment is unfair.  To understand why we must recognize that the Celtics at their core have a flawed roster, and one that has easily been exposed. For example, despite winning 53 games this season, they still lack a true center. Al Horford is a fine player, but he’s also a power forward masquerading as a five man. He has been abused by Chicago’s 7-footer Robin Lopez, who right now is collecting one out of every five Bulls misses ― a clip that easily would have led the league during the regular season. The Bulls have also dominated the glass thus far, out-rebounding Boston by a margin of 23. Then there’s Boston’s helplessness in protecting the rim, which has allowed Chicago’s perimeter players to live in the paint. Neither Horford, Amir Johnson, Kelly Olynyk or Tyler Zeller are legitimate shot-blocking threats. As a result, Jimmy Butler and Dwyane Wade have attacked relentlessly, enjoying a barrage of free passes in the lane. In one of their better combined performances of the season, the duo each scored 22 points in a 111-97 Game 2 win. The performance showed us the importance of having wings who can “get theirs” in the playoffs. Boston’s most glaring deficiency, however, stems from its best player. Isaiah Thomas, for all his offensive prowess, has been put in the blender by Bulls point guard Rajon Rondo, who has turned back the clock to his Celtic days, when he earned four consecutive All-Star appearances. Thomas, understandably, is not his normal self right now, after the unexpected death of his sister. But then again, the 31-year-old Rondo ― who scored 11 points and dished out 14 assists, while amassing 9 rebounds and 5 steals in Game 2 ― is simply doing to him what others have done all season. It’s unclear how things will play out now that Rondo has been declared out indefinitely with a broken thumb, but Thomas isn’t exactly primed for a defensive turnaround. According to ESPN’s Defensive Real Plus Minus, the 5-foot-9 Thomas ranked dead last this season for all point guards. So perhaps it’s no surprise that Rondo completely dictated his tempo to Thomas. In Game 2, for example, the Bulls shot 58 percent when the shot was created by Rondo, but just 47 percent on all other attempts, per ESPN Stats & Info. As one NBA head coach told me recently of Thomas: “He just can’t defend. Probably the worst we’ve seen all year as far as point guards go.” Thomas’ sheer inability to guard his position puts Stevens in a precarious spot. He can’t bench him, because Thomas is the main source of offense. He couldn’t put Avery Bradley on Rondo, because it would free up Butler ― and Rondo’s absence doesn’t change anything because Thomas can still only guard one position. Jae Crowder is a good player but he doesn’t have the foot speed to check Butler or Wade, and Marcus Smart can’t play extended minutes because he’s so bad offensively. Finally, there is the talented but green rookie Jaylen Brown, who is lightyears away from being trusted on this stage. Naturally, when general manager Danny Ainge was asked about the criticism of Stevens, he deflected the blame. ”I think anything is fair,” Ainge said following Game 2. “I don’t agree with them, but I haven’t written this series off yet either. I don’t even want to go there. I think that anything is fair. Sure. Any criticism is fair.” The only “fair” criticism right now should be aimed at Ainge, who has been the architect of the entire roster. Don’t forget that he is sitting on gold right now ― a pick-swap with the Brooklyn Nets in June’s draft, plus the Nets’ 2018 first-round selection. Remember the swirling rumors of Butler and Indiana’s Paul George both being on the trading block? Not making a deal wasn’t only foolish, it was pure negligence. The opportunity to land a top 10 player in his prime doesn’t come along often ― and when two were being shopped, Ainge is the one at fault for not doing whatever it took to make it happen. Regardless of what happens the rest of this series, Brad Stevens has surely done his part. The former Butler University coach resurrected a moribund franchise to improved win totals during all four seasons at the helm: 25 in his first year, then 40, 48 and 53. Regardless of what happens now, that shouldn’t be forgotten.

"At least four sets of sisters are among those speaking out about their experiences with Larry Nassar, the disgraced doctor accused of molesting more than 140 young female athletes. Maddie and Kara Johnson spoke Friday during Nassar’s sentencing hearing; two others, identified only as Victim 11 and Victim 136, were heard in court the day before. Amanda Thomashow, who reported Nassar to police in 2014, was joined by sister Jessica in court earlier this week, and Katie Payne and Maureen Payne Baum were on the “Today” show late last year to tell their stories.  More than 100 accusers and their family members have shared victim impact statements in court. Nassar served as a team doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University until he was fired in 2016.  Nassar, who is already serving 60 years in prison for possession of child pornography, faces a new sentence of up to 125 years after pleading guilty in November to 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct. In court, the Johnson sisters recalled trusting Nassar largely because he was an Olympic doctor with framed photos of the athletes he had treated. “I felt so lucky that I got to see the same doctor as all of my idols in the gymnastics world,” Maddie said. Their father, Brad Johnson, who is also a doctor, called out MSU and USA Gymnastics for allowing Nassar’s behavior to continue for so long. “These institutions emphasize the importance of safe spaces. Ironically, the only safe place that was created was for Larry Nassar,” he said, per Deadspin’s Dvora Meyers, who first noted the number of siblings appearing together in court. ""You smacked my butt and said, 'We're done here sweetie,'"" Kara Johnson said of Nassar The Johnson sisters said Nassar didn’t abuse them during appointments when their father accompanied them, but other former patients have said the misconduct occurred within feet of their parents. Maureen Payne Baum said Nassar once briefly assaulted her while standing in between her and her father. She and her sister have said their gymnastics coaches encouraged them to see Nassar when they competed in the sport around ages 12 to 14.   Victim 11 and Victim 136 said Nassar asked other medical staff to leave the room during appointments. Amanda Thomashow said in court that she has experienced anxiety and depression since reporting Nassar for abuse in 2014, adding that she had put aside her dream of becoming a doctor.  “When Larry Nassar assaulted me and MSU covered for him, it changed the trajectory of my life,” she said. “Someday I will be whole again.” Jessica Thomashow said Nassar abused her when she sought treatments for gymnastics-related injuries when she was 9 and 12.  “What you did to me was twisted,” she said. “You manipulated me and my family. How dare you.” Brian McKeen, the attorney for Katie Payne and Maureen Payne Baum, criticized MSU’s attempt to dismiss lawsuits brought by Nassar’s accusers while simultaneously purporting to support the survivors. “MSU’s hypocrisy is shameful,” he said in a statement issued this week. “The University claims that many of the assaults happened so long ago that the law now bars the claims from being brought. This firmly places the blame on teenage girls for being terrified to speak up, or for their naiveté regarding the assaults.” More than a dozen MSU employees were tipped off to Nassar’s behavior in the two decades before his arrest but did nothing, according to a Detroit News report. ",he,said,statement
"It might be a stretch to say that American consumers are legally illiterate. After all, don't we watch Law & Order? In fact, one recent survey found that 10 percent of U.S. college graduates believed Judge Judy was on the Supreme Court. (In our political climate, I suppose anything is possible.) But when it comes to federal consumer laws, there is real ignorance. Day after day, I see consumers banging their heads against the wall. They know what's happening to them is wrong, that there ought to be a law, but they don't know enough about the law to invoke it. So which laws should you know about? I asked a few experts, and here's what they told me: The Electronic Funds Transfers Act (EFTA)
 ""It's not well known and not often utilized by consumers,"" says Larry Smith, a consumer rights attorney at SmithMarco, a Chicago law firm. The EFTA governs financial institutions and banks when allowing money to be transferred by computer terminal. ""Banks are required to provide certain disclosures to their customers,"" he explains. ""If there are errors that occur regarding a transfer, there are investigation requirements and other mandates regarding the re-funding of an account and the charging of interest on disputed transfers."" In other words, if you made a purchase and it involved an electronic transfer of money, chances are the EFTA protects you. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA)
 ""This is the most important federal statute and regulation regarding the servicing of mortgage loans,"" says Josh Denbeaux, a financial consumer rights attorney. The federal statute governs the performance and enforcement of the loan. ""There are many, many times that mortgage servicers and lenders make mistakes in their accounting and servicing of the mortgage loan,"" he adds. ""Consumers have rights under RESPA and all would be well-served to read the CFPB website for its explanation of consumer rights under the statute."" The California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)
 Although this is technically not a federal law, it has national implications, explains Zachary Paruch, a small business expert at Termly, a site that helps you generate terms and conditions for your online business. CalOPPA stipulates that any online service which is based in California, or collects personal information from residents in California, is required to conspicuously post a privacy policy. ""This means that if an online business is located in, or can be accessed by anyone in California, it is subject to this regulation,"" he says. If your business doesn't disclose, it could be in violation of the law, which could work in your favor if you're trying to build a case. The Fiduciary Rule
 The rule, which is part of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) is a federal law that sets minimum standards for most voluntarily established pension and health plans in private industry to provide protection for individuals in these plans. But it contains a provision that sets important standards for your financial advisor. “It’s important that Americans who are saving for retirement are aware of the fiduciary rule,"" says Jay Shah, CEO of Personal Capital. The problem? The rule is changing, even as I write it, and the word ""fiduciary"" isn't in everyone's vocabulary. ""But what it means is very simple,"" adds Shah. ""It says that your financial advisor should be required to act in your best interest, not their own, when advising on retirement investment accounts. It should be called the ‘no conflict of interest rule.’” How misunderstood is the rule? Well, a few weeks ago, when I wrote about the fiduciary, I suggested the Trump administration had rescinded parts of it. Turns out the truth is a lot more complicated. This is by no means a complete list of essential consumer laws, but it's a start. Knowing about these laws will help you use them correctly the next time you have money to invest, buy a house, or purchase something online. And if a business won't listen, then you can have your day in court. Christopher Elliott specializes in solving unsolvable consumer problems. Contact him with your questions on his advocacy website.

"Dear Organizers of the Women’s March. Dear Human Rights Watch! I am a female Arab academic who considers Islam to be her religion. I have extensively researched the conditions of women in the Arab Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region in addition to the United Kingdom and South Africa; and have been been involved in various campaigns for gender justice, freedom of expression, religion and political association. In other words, I have an established record in the defense of universal human rights. I supported the idea of the Women’s March since its start. I thought and still think it was important to send a clear message to the new American president. Mr. Trump’s acrimonious campaign made it clear that he needed a reminder that universal human rights are not subject to negotiation. We are not entering into a post-human rights era. They are here to stay and the Women’s March was supposed to be a reminder that there are enough people in the United States and the world willing to fight peacefully for these rights. And it was indeed a success. Congratulations! That said, I was alarmed by some posters used for your campaign, namely the posters showing a woman wearing the American flag as a headscarf (veil). It was meant as a symbol for the minority of Islamic faith and their rights to equal citizenship. While the idea behind it is to be praised and applauded. Your choice of the symbol was misguided, to say the least. The headscarf (veil) is a controversial symbol. If you are working in the defense of women’s rights, you should know that by now. Some consider it a religious symbol; others see it as a tool of patriarchal control and oppression; and yet others consider it a symbol of the march of political Islam. When it comes to wearing the headscarf (veil), some women wear it because they truly believe it to be part of their faith. Others, one the other hand, are forced to wear it, and these are many. Those, who insist on not wearing it face physical and physiological sanctions from their family and community. I dealt with such cases in my consulting work with educational authorities here in Switzerland. In certain parts of the UK, some women’s rights activists have to wear the headscarf in order for them to get access to the women trapped in their closed communities. In Egypt, where a wave of young women taking off their veil is on the march, some young women face defamation and threats. And in some Islamic countries, women are forced to wear the headscarf whether they wanted it or not. For example, in Iran, women are not privileged with the freedom of choice. Like it or not they have to wear the headscarf. The veil was the symbol by which the Islamic Revolution showed its face to the world – by decreeing that all women should cover themselves! Those who disobey this decree are faced with fines and arrest. Given the complexity of the headscarf (veil) and what it represents, your choice of it as a symbol for the Islamic religion and the minority of Islamic faith was ill advised. Why choose a symbol ― considered a tool of oppression for many women in different parts of the world ― as a symbol of a rich and diverse religion like Islam? It is not only misguided, it is an insult to all of these women, who have to wear it and bear the psychological scars of that imposition. I continue to support the demands of your march but I urge you to chose your posters carefully. It is the message you are sending that is my concern. If you are marching for equality, then I suggest that you stop patronizing those women of Islamic faith and heritage. Not all women of Islamic faith wear the headscarf, nor are all convinced that this is THE symbol of Islam. Choose a symbol that reflects that diversity.",you,suggest,faith
"“Not on Rex Manning Day!” That’s been a rallying cry for fans of “Empire Records” every April 8 since the ’90s alternateen classic came out. In the 1995 film, April 8 is the day Rex Manning, a smarmy, overly manicured ’80s pop star played by Maxwell Caulfield, is scheduled to appear in the titular record store staffed by people who hate him ― and everything he stands for. April 8 also happens to be the day that the body of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was discovered in his Seattle home. This Rex Manning Day, actor Ethan Embry, who played the film’s loveably spacey character Mark, made the connection explicit.  “The reason we picked April 8th as the day to have the powdered/coifed Rex Manning visit Empire is because Kurt was found on the 8th of April, the day the music of the 90s lost its mascot,” Embry tweeted. The reason we picked April 8th as the day to have the powdered/coifed Rex Manning visit Empire is because Kurt was found on the 8th of April, the day the music of the 90s lost its mascot.#RexManningDay Embry’s co-star Johnny Whitworth, who played A.J., echoed the sentiment. Cobain, a human being and not merely a mascot, killed himself on April 5, 1994. His death shook the rock world and signaled the beginning of the end of the ’90s grunge era, which was replaced later in the decade by the more polished pop sound of boy bands and Britney Spears.

"Uber says it will reimburse its New York City drivers “tens of millions” of dollars in lost earnings for miscalculating its commission there for several years. The ride-hailing company said it had inadvertently calculated its commission since November 2014 based on drivers’ “gross” fares ― before taxes and fees are taken out. Instead, it should have collected a percent of the smaller, post-tax “net” fare. Uber said it realized the error last Friday, after it revamped how it shows drivers their earnings and discovered their commissions violated the terms of service. The company told HuffPost it would refund drivers’ backpay they’re due, plus 9 percent interest. The average driver should receive around $900. “We are committed to paying every driver every penny they are owed - plus interest - as quickly as possible,” said Rachel Holt, Regional General Manager, US & Canada, in an emailed statement. “We are working hard to regain driver trust, and that means being transparent, sticking to our word, and making the Uber experience better from end to end.” But New York’s Independent Drivers Guild said the news is just one more sign of an industry in need of regulation. “Uber’s theft of drivers’ hard-earned wages is the latest in a long history of underhanded tactics in this industry,” IDG founder Jim Conigliaro Jr. told HuffPost in an emailed statement.  “Year after year, companies like Uber, Lyft, Juno and Gett become more valuable and year after year they find new ways to take advantage of hard-working drivers,” he added. “This is exactly why we have been calling for industry-wide pay protections to stop the exploitation of New York’s drivers once and for all.”  It’s unclear if Uber drivers in other cities have been subject to similar miscalculations. The company said it is reviewing that possibility but has yet to find another instance.  While Uber calculates its take based on drivers’ “net” fares, ride-hailing competitor Lyft told HuffPost its commissions still are based on its drivers’ gross fares, as its agreement specifies. “In New York, we deduct commissions and administrative fees from gross fares, as per our driver agreement,” a Lyft spokesman said in an emailed statement. “We also pay sales tax on gross fares as required by law.” ",he,added,drivers
"A federal judge heard arguments Wednesday in a case that could put Uber’s self-driving car development on hiatus, based on claims from rival Waymo that Uber stole some of its trade secrets. Waymo, a Google-spinoff, is seeking an injunction against Uber’s program, effectively halting it for the duration of the trial. Self-driving vehicles are central to Uber’s long-term business strategy, so halting work on them could have severe financial repercussions for the company. At the heart of the case is a technology called LiDAR that helps an autonomous vehicle map out and navigate its surroundings as it’s driving. Waymo lawyers presented evidence that a former executive named Anthony Levandowski downloaded Waymo’s LiDAR designs, along with some 14,000 other documents, before he left the company in January 2016. Soon after Levandowski left, he started a competitor company named “Otto” that was purchased by Uber for $680 million less than a year later. Waymo lawyer Charles Verhoeven portrayed Otto as little more than a shell company, founded by Levandowski for no other purpose than selling valuable, confidential technology to Uber. And while U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup conceded, speaking of Waymo’s evidence, that he’s “never seen a record this strong in 42 years,” ultimately the company struggled to prove that Uber asked Levandowski to steal Waymo’s files on Uber’s behalf. That matters, since Waymo is suing Uber ― not Levandowski. “I’m listening very carefully to see the proof that shows that Uber was aware that he downloaded information,” Alsup told Charles Verhoeven. “That would be pretty damning if you had that.” Verhoeven maintained that proof does exist, but it’s among 3,500 or so documents, which Uber says contain confidential information that it refused to release. Complicating matters, Levandowski has asserted his fifth amendment rights and refused to testify. (He also stepped away from Uber’s LiDAR-related research for the duration of the case). In lieu of the “smoking gun” Alsup sought, Verhoeven presented evidence claiming Levandowski conspired with Uber before he left Waymo. “There was this clandestine plan all along that Uber and Levandowski had a deal,” he said. That evidence includes emails Levandowski exchanged with Uber while he still worked at Waymo, and 5.3 million shares of stock (worth approximately $250 million) Uber granted Levandowski on Jan. 28, 2016, the day after he left Google. Uber responded by clarifying it actually awarded Levandowski the stock months later during the Otto acquisition, but set the vesting date earlier as a courtesy. Uber, represented by outside lawyer Arturo Gonzalez, denied any wrongdoing, as it always has. “We are adamant that we did not use any of their secrets,” he said. Notably, however, Uber also hasn’t gone out of its way to defend Levandowski. Gonzalez said Uber “didn’t have any basis” to dispute that Levandowski downloaded the 14,000 files. While it’s conceivable he brought them into work on a personal laptop and consulted them, Gonzalez said, “There’s no evidence that it happened.” Uber’s ultimate goal is to move the case out of the public spotlight and into arbitration, where this could all be settled privately. The judge is expected to make a decision on the injunction sometime in the next couple weeks. A trial ― should it come to that ― would likely begin sometime in October.",that,started,less
" OK. I admit it. I'm a Scrabble addict -- an online Scrabble addict, to be more exact. There, I said it. If there was a Scrabble Anonymous, I'd  be in it, confessing to my word-conjuring comrades the rush I feel every time I lay down the perfect 32-point word. Fourteen games. That's how many I have going on at any given moment, some with folks as far away as South Africa.  I've played 3,086 games in the past few years and have won 55% of them.   Methinks I've learned more about life from Scrabble than I did from four years of college. Canterbury Tales? The sonnets of William Shakespeare? How to drink oddball vodka concoctions until I fell down?  Interesting pastimes, for sure, but nowhere near the insights I've gleaned from the game invented, 76 years ago, by the little known demi-God, Alfred Mosher Butts. By my own calculations, I've discovered 114 algorithmic variables to the game, subtle principles of play, point and counterpoint that need to be considered before making a move.  And while chess is considered, by many, to be the more sophisticated game, there are strategically synaptic moments in Scrabble that reveal chess to be little more than Pin the Tail on the Donkey at a fourth grade birthday party. Like all great games, works of genius, love affairs, and near death experiences, there is a defining moment, in Scrabble, that reigns supreme -- one existential, moon howling, Job-in-the-belly-of-the-whale moment that, metaphorically speaking, I imagine was at least partially responsible for Van Gogh cutting off his ear. I'm talking about the appearance of a perfect 7-letter word in one's rack that cannot be placed on the board because THERE IS NO PLACE TO PUT IT! This word -- this fabulous, pristine, classic, sacred, mellifluous, God given, off-the-grid word DOES NOT FIT. It does not fit anywhere. Either the board is too cluttered, my opponent has sealed off all openings, or it just doesn't connect to anything I see. It just sits there. Inert. Unmoving. Zen koan-like. The first word of an acceptance speech I will never give. So there I am, silent and alone with my perfectly crafted 7-letter word, racking what's left of my  brain to find it's perfect home, but there is no home, no home on the range, no home on the board, no home away from home, no nothing -- the perfect habitation for my unrequited need to express now bulldozed by the two-dimensional moment I find myself  suddenly tourist in. I see the word, am seized by the word, believe in the word, but I cannot move. I cannot lay it down. I've been checkmated and I'm not even playing chess. This game I play, you see, is playing me -- the ancient game of trying to express, the game of giving voice to the void, to say something significant before I die.  This game that's been played since the beginning of time, long before the first hieroglyph, is a game that will continue being played until the sun burns down.  And long after that. The rules?  There is a board, the board of life -- the one you and I must agree on to play.  There are pieces. That's you and me and the 7 billion other souls on planet Earth, each with their own unique dialect and favorite name for God.  We do our best to play, to lay down our words, our songs, our symphonies, sculptures, moves, causes, works of art, businesses, theories, inventions, hopes and dreams -- praying they will, somehow, connect, somehow have impact, somehow break open the conspiracy of silence long enough for all the forces of goodness and light inside us to express their unspeakable longing to be seen and heard. And so, good people of cyberspace and time, by the grace of the compassionate Scrabble gods and the extraordinary luxury of having this Huffington Post platform to stretch my invisible wings, I hereby, and with great respect for you and all the logophiles in your life, lay down, in the boardless space below, a small sampling of my still untallied 7-letter words for your diversion and delight. May you find a place to put them. And if you can't or won't, may you savor the fact that they exist at all. Aeolian. Coaxial.  Equinox. Samurai. Qabalah.  Jukebox. Dervish. Exotica. Rainbow.

"Michael Avenatti, the seemingly omnipresent attorney for porn star Stormy Daniels, tweeted out an email Thursday he thought people might have interest in. The email had been sent last month by Michael Cohen, the longtime personal attorney of Donald Trump, who by then was already under federal investigation. The recipient was lawyer Keith Davidson. Cohen had recently gotten a new phone, he wrote in the email, and wanted to make sure he had Davidson’s contact information in it.  “Let me know how you want to communicate,” he said.  On April 9, the FBI raided Mr. Cohen’s home, office and hotel room. Within 48 hours, Mr. Cohen sent the below email to Mr. Davidson. Why? They had no ongoing legal matter at the time. Was it part of an attempt by Mr. Cohen to obstruct justice or worse? #basta pic.twitter.com/e7DfLSxG4x Davidson is reportedly cooperating with authorities as they investigate Cohen’s various dealings, which makes sense, because Cohen and Davidson go back. When Daniels first cut a $130,000 deal with Cohen in 2016 to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Trump, it was Davidson who represented her. After Davidson helped ink another Trump-related deal between Karen McDougal and American Media Inc. that same year, he sent an email to Cohen asking him to call.¹ The Wall Street Journal reported in April that Davidson also struck a deal last year on behalf of what was said to be an unnamed former Playboy model  alleging that Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy had impregnated her. Cohen wasn’t Broidy’s attorney, but Davidson reached right out to Cohen anyway, or so Cohen said. (The details of that case are murky, and one popular theory suggests that Trump, not Broidy, impregnated the model.) Later, Broidy said, “Although I had not previously hired Mr. Cohen, I retained Mr. Cohen after he informed me about his prior relationship with Mr. Davidson.” They clearly have some mutual respect for one another, too. Earlier this year, when Davidson found out New York magazine reporter Molly Redden, now at HuffPost, was working on a profile of him, his spokesman suggested she reach out to none other than Cohen for a quote on what a decent, boring guy Davidson was.  But while it feels as if the whole world has zeroed in on Cohen, Davidson has largely escaped the public eye, floating instead on the periphery of the biggest story in the world. In his natural habitat, the demimonde of celebrity tabloids, this is long how he has operated. For years, he has been a fixture of the tabloids, popping up in TMZ article after TMZ article, but his relationship with both the outlet and the industry has never been clear. So a little over two years ago, a man named William Bastone started to poke around to see what it is, exactly, that Davidson does.  Bastone, a longtime investigative reporter and co-founder of the news website The Smoking Gun, started to investigate the Los Angeles-based attorney, whose list of past clients reads like a Rolodex of B-list Hollywood. He wanted to better understand his deep association with the tabloid industry, his tendency to find his way into celebrity sex tape negotiations and the close relationship he evidently enjoys with someone at TMZ.  Soon enough, Bastone said, “it became clear that he acted in a manner that was different from most lawyers.” Bastone found that Davidson indeed benefited greatly from a relationship with a former TMZ employee named Mike Walters. Bastone also discovered that Davidson was engaging in some questionable lawyering of the kind not generally appreciated by the legal profession. Everything with Bastone’s reporting was proceeding normally ― up until February, when he met Davidson at a Manhattan cafe as he drew closer to publishing the piece. The conversation itself was fine. But what happened next was, as Bastone put it, “bizarre,” “strange,” “insane,” “weird” and “crazy.” Recently, I spoke to Bastone about the story he wound up publishing in The Smoking Gun, a 14,500-word investigation into the tabloid lawyer.  The conversation below has been edited, condensed and organized for clarity. If you have information you’d like us to know, email me at maxwell@huffpost.com or direct message me at @maxwellstrachan.  *** So when did you first start looking into Keith Davidson as a profile subject? It was the very early part of 2016. I was looking at some notes of the guy I interviewed in March of 2016, so I was clearly noodling around before that. So, two-plus years ago. Why did you take an interest in him that long ago? He has a legal practice like none other. I would hear of him always having some kind of involvement in sex tapes, and people would tell me that he had had multiple matters that involved Charlie Sheen that he settled. And I had heard other things about him that got my interest. Just from being a careful reader of TMZ, I could tell that there was a very close relationship with somebody at TMZ.  I [also] knew that this was a lawyer who had already been sanctioned by the California bar. He had his license suspended for a period of time. So it became clear that he acted in a manner that was different from most lawyers.  Could you just sort of explain to me the system Davidson seemed to have set up within the larger tabloid world? The relationship with TMZ, specifically with this Mike Walters guy, was easily the most important relationship he had in entertainment circles.² Because Walters was news editor, whatever his title was at TMZ. He was there a decade. He was basically Harvey Levin’s top deputy, and he saw every tip that came in. Anybody who called them up looking to make some money ― he knew who they were, he knew how to contact those people. So he was at a very important place in the gossip-slash-celebrity news world. What TMZ ended up being for Davidson was a source of client referrals that came through Walters.  And it was also the place they used to kind of hype and churn stories about sex tapes. So for the longest time, it was a staple at TMZ. There was this arc of stories that would always begin ― all exclusives ― TMZ has learned that “Celebrity A” is seen in a sex tape that somebody is shopping in Los Angeles to entertainment and porn people. Then there would be a follow-up Mike Walters exclusive that would describe the action in the sex tape. Then there would be a story about how there is a bidding war for the sex tape.  For [Davidson], it was a way of getting out the fact that they had the tape. They used one another. It’s more churning of exclusives for TMZ. But also, it was tremendously valuable for Davidson because it got out the word that he had them ― a friendly reminder to the celebrity that maybe you gotta take your checkbook out because this could get a lot worse.  What did TMZ or Walters get out of that relationship? Was it just the steady stream of exclusives, or was there something else there?  Well, I mean, yeah, they get exclusives. Were any of these earth-shattering stories? I don’t know.  Keith Davidson provided legal services to Mike Walters. He provided legal services to Charles Walters, who was Mike Walters’ dad. Davidson said he may have provided legal services to a third member of the Walters family ― he wasn’t certain about that. I asked Davidson, “Did you charge them for this legal stuff?” and he said, “Well, maybe I charged his dad only for my expenses, but, well, I may have just done it for free because I was a good friend of Mike’s.” So, at the very least, there were either discounted or free legal services.  Davidson also formed a company that described itself as a marketing-and-promotion company that Walters is the president and sole officer of ― that listed Keith Davidson’s office as the address of the company. So I asked them, “What does a news editor at TMZ need to have a promotion-and-consulting company for ― that runs out of your office, Keith?” He wouldn’t talk about it, and I said, “Is that because you were paying him or his company referral fees?” and I quote him in the piece, he says, “I’m not going to lie to you, nor am I going to do anything that’s going to have a negative effect on anyone else.”³ I don’t know, it just seems like the way [Walters] comported himself at TMZ, I think you’d be fired from every legitimate journalistic outfit in the country. I understand it’s TMZ and all that, but they’re owned by Time Warner. Time Warner has standards, and I understand that they allow them to pay for stuff, but I see that thing as a firing offense at any publication.  Did you find anything to counteract the idea that Davidson didn’t have an adverse effect on anyone’s life? [Laughs] I mean, everything he does has an adverse effect on somebody’s life! I’m sure if you spoke to Charlie Sheen about him, Charlie Sheen thinks he’s had an incredibly adverse effect on his life, as does Kanye West and anybody who’s had to write a check for a videotape that was on a laptop that was stolen. The key to his business has always been the fact that he has people ― Walters being one, Kevin Blatt being another, this woman Gina Rodriguez out in L.A. being one ― being the steerers for him, the sources of business referrals. That’s the key. If you take those people away, then how does anyone find him?  So you have a porn actress or an escort who has something to say about Tiger Woods or Charlie Sheen, well, she’s not necessarily going to know, “Oh, I should reach out to Keith Davidson.” But she might know somebody, another actress or something, who says, “Oh, you should talk to Gina Rodriguez, she’s a former porn actress and she does stuff with the tabloids and she sells stories to TMZ and the Enquirer and Radar and all these places.” Before you know it, Gina Rodriguez is steering, if there’s a legal claim, right to Keith Davidson to handle that end of the business. Same thing with Kevin Blatt. If you found yourself in possession of a sex tape and you went on Google and you wrote “sex tape broker” or “Hollywood sex tape,” he’d be the first thing that came up, and he had a many-, many-years relationship with Davidson. The same thing with Walters at TMZ. When the guy who possessed three of the Hulk Hogan sex tapes contacted TMZ to do a deal to show them a little bit of the sex tapes, Walters immediately steered him toward Davidson to try to monetize the whole tapes ― the same way Walters steered an employee of the Betty Ford clinic who had gotten into a confrontation with Lindsay Lohan. He directed her right to Keith Davidson, so he was getting these referrals from a variety of different places. How does he end up with Stormy Daniels? He gets Stormy Daniels through Gina Rodriguez, who was once married to a male porn actor who used to perform with Stormy Daniels. So when she needed someone, she knew, “Oh, Gina Rodriguez is a person who can help you navigate the tabloid-slash-legal world.”  When Karen McDougal wants to talk to someone about her relationship with Donald Trump, she bounces it off of a friend of hers who knows a guy, and the guy he knows happens to be an associate of Keith Davidson’s. So he has people who just deliver clients to him, and those people get rewarded for it. I mean Blatt, Rodriguez, the people who referred McDougal have all gotten pieces of the action. They’re not just doing it to be nice. They end up getting paid. Michael Cohen is a bit part in this story, but they have such an amicable relationship and so often find themselves on each side of the table. What are your thoughts there? I mean, I know that Michael Cohen had nothing to do with Davidson’s representation of Stormy Daniels. There was no delivering her as a client. I could see no evidence that there was a conspiracy going on there.  Ditto with McDougal, because I know how McDougal ended up as a client of his, and how Stormy Daniels became a client of his. Now the question of, was there something else going on here where the deals that were struck ― that Davidson sold them out and basically was two-timing them? You know, I think that’s still a little unclear, frankly. Davidson’s contention was that both of them were suffering from seller’s remorse. [Daniels] got 130 grand and McDougal got 150 grand, both prior to Election Day, and now his contention was the two of them were upset because they now think they didn’t get what they could have gotten monetarily. That was not a complaint of theirs at the time and only surfaces after they realize, “Oh, shit, Donald Trump is the fucking president now.” The McDougal settlement is through AMI and Pecker and Dylan Howard, but obviously Cohen is floating on the periphery of that, and he was directly involved in the Stormy Daniels thing, so I think that in terms of whether there was collusion, as it were, on those, the jury’s out. But Cohen did steer this guy, Chuck LaBella, into Davidson ―⁴ And I think he steered the Playboy model in the Broidy ―⁵ That’s unclear. The way that Broidy tells it is that Broidy gets contacted by Cohen, who had been contacted by Davidson, and Cohen tells Broidy, “Well, I’ve dealt with this guy before, so maybe I can represent you and we can hash it out.” I don’t think it’s clear as to really what happened there.  So, this Playmate found her way to Davidson, and Davidson’s first move was to call Cohen because ― why? That’s a little unclear. Because he knew Broidy was a big-wig Republican? I don’t know. Of all of them, I think that one is the most interesting. In the piece, you said that Davidson “engaged in the kind of activities that result in severe disciplinary sanctions.” What in particular stood out about his behavior? I’d say his representation of the individuals who were his clients in the Hulk Hogan sex tape case is very, very, very damaging.⁶  These are two individuals, a guy by the name of Matt Loyd and a woman by the name of Lori Burbridge. Loyd’s account of his dealings with Davidson are through a series of interviews that I did, and Burbridge’s accounts of her dealings with Davidson are through FBI interviews and also a lengthy 100-page-plus deposition of her by the Tampa police and state prosecutor’s office. She talks about Davidson and Loyd talks about Davidson directing them to lie, to fabricate stories about how they came into possession of the sex tapes. Those were the two core things — both of them said they were directed to lie because that was the way they were going to get a deal done.  For instance, they had to claim that they were the ones that had provided Gawker with the excerpt from one of the sex tapes, and they had to lie about that because if they didn’t claim responsibility, it left open the possibility that the person who did provide it to Gawker might go and provide it to somebody else, and that’s the last thing Hogan wanted to do ― pay somebody $300,000 and then have all the same sex tapes being distributed by another party who had them. So they had to create this lie that they pushed, and they’re both on the record about the story that he directed them to create about how they obtained the tapes. That’s some pretty crazy stuff. I wanted to ask you a bit about your interactions with Davidson during the piece.  Well, we had a series of interviews. I did not want to sit in a room with him with my 2 feet of files and documents because I was referring to emails and stuff like that. I didn’t want him to have any idea where I got a lot of this stuff from. So we did six hours or so over the phone in maybe two or three conversations, and then I said, “When I’m done with the conversations, we’ll sit down and have a face-to-face so you can see who I am.” That was the first meeting I had with him, and that was basically his attempt to try to ― just want to be careful here ― he was making his argument for why perhaps there were other stories I should be pursuing besides the one about him.  So, you know, I told him: “I’m writing the story about you. I’m not horse trading here for anything else you might want to offer or something like that.” He made it very clear what areas of the interview he was concerned about. Meaning I found out things that he knew were problematic and he was clearly concerned that they were going to cause a problem with the bar association. He made the pitch for like, “Well, do you have to include that?” and I’m like, “Uh, yeah. I’m not leaving anything out.”  So we left, and I’m writing the piece, and he contacts me, and he says he wants to have another conversation before I finish the story, and I said, “Well, OK, I’m free now. Do you want to do it now?” and he’s like, “No, no, I want to do it in person.” And I said, “Are you in New York?” And he said, “No, I’m in Los Angeles, and I said, “What, are you going to fly across the country to do this thing?” and he said, “Well, I can’t do it over the phone.” I said, “I’m not going to have you come back round trip to have some conversation with me.” And he said, “Oh, it’s no problem. It’s no problem.”  So I was like: “Alright, whatever. If you want to come here. I told you this story is happening, so if you’re going to come back and we’re going to have a repeat of our last meeting, it’s going to be a waste of our time.” And he said, “No, no, no, I want to talk to you just in person. Just don’t want to do it on the phone.”   We met on a Sunday morning at a Le Pain Quotidien on Bleecker Street. He arrives. He’s looking all glum and gives me the line: “While you’ve been investigating me, I’ve been investigating you.”  I’m like, Oh, this is going to be good. Where is this going? Then he fishes out this document from his roller bag and he says he has gathered up this information. He wanted to show it to me, and he wanted to let me know what’s out there and what’s in the piece is exactly what happened.⁷ He hands me over this two-page document. I then read this insane sort of intelligence report about me and my website and my criminal connections and my involvement in an international narcotics trafficking ring. What did you think when you saw the document?  I was ― I read it and I said, “I give you permission to distribute this and publish it wherever you want.” And I said I’d like to publish it alongside the story. And he said, “No, no, no, no, no. That’s why I’m bringing this to your attention.” I said, “Well, what do you mean? You’re accusing me of being involved in a narcotics trafficking conspiracy.”  “Oh, no, no, I just wanted to just let you know what’s out there, like what my private investigator found out.” I said: “I’m giving you permission to publish that. You can give it to any reporter you want. Any journal. Anybody you know, you can distribute it, disseminate it, publish it, but I’d really like to publish it alongside the story I’m going to do about you. I’ll put it somewhere in the first four to five graphs, I’ll make a reference to it.” “Oh no, no, no, no, no. I’m not looking to distribute them.”  So I said, “Well, what are you doing?” And I said to him, “This, you and me here at this table, is feeling a little extortion-y to me.” “Oh no, no, no, no, no. That’s not what it’s meant to be.” I said, “So you came all the way across the country and you’re going to fly all the way back today to tell me that in conjunction with your unnamed private investigator, you developed this information about me being involved in a narcotics trafficking ring?”  I told him: “That’s ludicrous. You know it’s ludicrous, and I just don’t understand what the fuck” — I was a little pissed off — “I just don’t understand what the game is here. Like, what you think’s going to happen. Like, is this your move to muscle me into not publishing?”  “No, no, no. I just want to give you the opportunity to look at it.”  At one point, I said: “You know, Keith, I know you’ve looked into my background. You’ve determined what I’ve written about, where I’ve worked, what my rep is. I’ve written about lots and lots of bad people, and I’ve done it for 30 years. I covered organized crime in New York for 12 years. I’ve written about every strain of narcotics traffickers, corrupt politicians, everything you can think of.” And I said, “You’re the guy, you’re the one person who dug up all this shit about me in a period of just a few days.” I said, “I’ve written stories that have put people in prison, and yet nobody found out about me and this narcotics trafficking conspiracy. I’ve written about mobsters ― I mean every wise guy in New York. But no one came forward to say, ‘Oh, he’s involved with Italian organized crime and narcotics trafficking.’ Don’t you think that’s a little fucked up?”  “Oh no, no, no, no. I’m not trying to pressure you or intimidate you.” And I basically told him: “We have anything else? Is there anything else that you want to talk to me about? And he said no, that was it, and I got up and left him. But I went right to my office and wrote a memo to the files about what had just transpired because my head was kind of swimming. I couldn’t quite figure out what the end game was. I just thought it was bizarre. It was so strange, and then as I write in the piece it did not stop that Sunday.  The following Tuesday, some person writes an email to a lawyer at the Manhattan law firm that incorporated our parent company. They just formed our company. They haven’t done any legal work for us, but if you went and checked our incorporation papers you would see the name of this law firm. They sent this email to one of the partners there and basically make the same allegations. I just thought it was insane. And then some guy calls an hour after they receive this email and is trying to get a conversation with one of the lawyers about me and my criminality and the site’s involvement in narcotics conspiracies. It was weird. It’s just ― it’s crazy. And when he pulled this, the email and then phone call, I wrote him. I said: “What the frick is going on? What are you doing with these calls and these emails from these people? These proxies of yours?” Never responded, and then his spokesman called me back, and I said, “I want you to answer why he’s spreading this fucking ludicrous misinformation about me and my site.” And the spokesman claimed to not know anything about it, so I didn’t push it past there.  I just thought it was ― it just seemed like it was the ― like they were the acts of a really desperate person, which were crazy. And coming from a lawyer!  Have you heard from Davidson or any of his associates since you published the piece? Nope. I think he’s … Busy enough now? He’s under siege! He’s radioactive. I mean it’s ― you know, I can’t imagine this is good for his business. Who wants to be hiring him right now? I’m sure it’s of wildly great concern to him because he’s just ― he’s taken a battering.  And geez, could you imagine if actually there are audiotapes of him and Cohen?⁸ *** ¹ McDougal’s legal team reached an agreement with American Media Inc. last month to let McDougal out of her contract, allowing her to speak freely about her alleged relationship with Trump. ² Walters left TMZ a little over a year ago following a confrontation with founder Harvey Levin. He has since started a competitor, The Blast. ³ The quote as presented in The Smoking Gun’s piece: “One, I don’t want to lie to you. And two, I don’t want to ever have an adverse effect on someone else’s life.” ⁴ Davidson told CNN days after The Smoking Gun’s investigation was published that Cohen had referred client Chuck LaBella to him. LaBella, a Trump associate who was a producer on NBC’s “The Apprentice,” said he never hired or met Davidson. But CNN reported Davidson wrote an email to actor Tom Arnold’s lawyer, Marty Singer, after Arnold publicly stated that LaBella had “the dirt” on Trump.  ⁵ On April 13, the Wall Street Journal reported that Cohen and Davidson negotiated a $1.6 million deal related to Republican National Committee deputy finance chairman Elliott Broidy’s affair with an undisclosed Playboy Playmate. ⁶ In 2012, Davidson contacted Hulk Hogan’s lawyer David Houston, claiming that his clients were in possession of sex tapes involving the former wrestler. The negotiations would eventually lead to investigations by the FBI and the Tampa Police Department. ⁷ The memo, as described by The Smoking Gun: “The document ― which had several redactions at the top of its opening page ― made a series of stunning claims that were purportedly backed up by intelligence reports. The Smoking Gun and this reporter, the memo stated, were connected to an international narcotics distribution ring overseen by an organized crime family in Italy. Aiding in these illicit endeavors, the memo alleged, was an attorney at the New York law firm which incorporated The Smoking Gun’s parent company. The web site was some kind of an elaborate front operation, according to the document Davidson eventually returned to his manila folder.” ⁸ CNN reported last month that the FBI has seized recordings Cohen made during his conversations with Davidson during a recent raid.

"DORAL, Fla. – The United States has never had kings, dukes or even barons, but President Donald Trump’s most loyal subjects have found a way to pay him millions of dollars in tribute anyway. New Jersey Republican congressman Tom MacArthur spent $15,221 to hold a fundraiser at Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, according to a HuffPost analysis of Federal Election Commission filings. Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican and a close Trump ally in the House, spent $689 for an office Christmas party at Trump’s hotel a few blocks from the White House. The Illinois-based Family PAC paid $3,183 to Trump’s hotel in Chicago to hold a conference there. And the Republican National Committee this week will likely spend in the neighborhood of a half-million dollars at Trump’s resort in Doral, a few miles west of downtown Miami, for its spring meeting — not counting hundreds or even thousands of dollars RNC members must pay out of their own pockets for airfare, hotel rooms and some meals. The golf resort boasts plenty of ornate chandeliers and baroque fountains — but lies directly beneath the flight path of Miami International Airport’s takeoffs and landings, and is miles from the closest beach. RNC members said they like it anyway, even if it means that some of their own money winds up in the president’s pockets. “Well, we elected a president who’s a businessman,” noted one RNC member on condition of anonymity. “A shrewd businessman.” Cindy Siddoway, the RNC committeewoman from Idaho, said she didn’t know how the RNC settled on Trump’s golf resort but had no objection. “I don’t have a have a problem with it,” she said. “It’s a lovely hotel.” In all, some 70 Republican candidates and parties from Washington state to Washington, D.C., have spent $1.9 million of their donors’ money at the president’s golf courses, hotels and restaurants thus far this election cycle. A portion of every one of these dollars enriches Trump and his family personally. “If you are a politician who, A, has no principles and, B, wants Donald Trump’s endorsement, then of course you will want to host your fundraising event at a Trump property,” said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, an open-government advocacy group that has successfully sued Trump for access to White House visitor logs. “There’s no better way to appeal to the transactional president, no better way to make a mark with the no-attention-span president.” One GOP official, on condition of anonymity, acknowledged the unsavoriness of funneling donor money to the president and his family but said that ― given Trump’s brazenness about profiting from his presidency — the party had essentially given up. “In terms of the optics of it? We’re way past that at this point,” the official said.  For years, the entire system of donors with financial interest in particular legislation and regulations giving campaign contributions to candidates who will then craft those same laws and regulations has been derided as corrupt and tantamount to legalized bribery. But candidates must abide by strict rules on what they can and cannot do with that money. Using it to personally enrich themselves is illegal. Trump’s refusal to divest himself of his hotels and golf courses — despite his promises to do so during the campaign — has made it possible for Republican candidates and parties to put money directly into his pocket. “It’s a scary reality when we’re discussing whether the president is susceptible to the influence of people paying him while president, but it is our current reality,” said Jordan Libowitz of the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which has sued Trump for violating the constitutional prohibition from taking payments from foreign and domestic government officials. The biggest source of GOP money flowing to Trump’s properties is the Republican National Committee, which essentially went under the control of Trump since his election in 2016. Through its March filing, it has spent $763,335 at Trump properties since Jan. 1, 2017. That includes $106,646 for a dinner at Trump’s Washington hotel in January, $224,858 for a weekend of meetings and fundraisers at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in March and $237,310 in advance payments to Trump’s Doral golf resort for this week’s spring meeting. In past meetings, the RNC would typically pay half of the total cost of the event beforehand, and the remainder afterward. The next biggest spender at Trump properties is the president’s re-election campaign, which is wholly under the president’s direct control. Thus far it has funneled $551,643 of its donors’ money to his hotels and golf resorts as well as to Trump Tower in Manhattan, where it rents office space and buys food from Trump’s restaurants there. Other high-profile spenders include Great America Committee and America First Action, two Trump-supporting political action committees that occasionally host fundraisers at his Washington, D.C., hotel. But Trump properties also draw smaller committees as well as candidates for House and Senate races, who choose to pay the higher prices that Trump venues often charge compared to nearby competitors. Illinois’ Adam Kinzinger, Kansas’ Kevin Yoder, New York’s Peter King, California’s David Valadao and Florida’s Ted Yoho are all Republican House members who reported spending at Trump properties. Both the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee have held events at Trump properties, as did the Morris County, New Jersey, Republican Party — reportedly with dire results. After paying Trump’s Bedminster golf course $24,487 and a Fox News host $30,000 to serve as keynote speaker, the fundraiser actually wound up losing money, leaving the local party with shaky finances. Omar Navarro, a Republican who hopes to replace Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters in Los Angeles, reported spending thousands at Trump’s golf resort in Palos Verdes. He conceded that the high costs at the Trump resort ate into the total he collected, but said it was the only venue that would agree to host him. “Trump is the only place where I can hold an event without being shut down,” Navarro said. “They don’t get intimidated by fascist people who keep us from having campaign events.” He said longtime Trump confidante Roger Stone headlined his first fundraiser and former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio his second. “It’s expensive. It’s not cheap,” he said. CREW’s Libowitz said it is obvious why candidates and incumbent Republican officials alike spend money at Trump properties: in the hopes of winning Trump’s support and endorsement. “If someone wanted to try to literally buy his favor, they have a direct and legal line to do so. This is why we’ve seen a sudden influx of spending by Republican candidates and committees at Trump properties where they had not previously spent,” Libowitz said. “They have to have their events somewhere, so many may believe that allowing the president to profit off of them will give them a leg up in gaining his support.” One Republican close to the White House, though, scoffed at the idea that Trump’s political office — known for its dysfunction — had the initiative or discipline to keep track of which candidates were frequenting Trump properties. “No,” he said. “Please.” Another Republican official close to Trump, who believed that the use of Trump properties by GOP candidates was ethically troubling, agreed that Trump’s political team is not paying any mind to who is spending money at his golf courses and hotels and who is not. “I don’t know that it is noticed by anyone,” the official said. “Maybe it is.” For Corey Stewart, a U.S. Senate candidate for Virginia, time is running out for somebody in the president’s political world to notice his Trump-brand loyalty. Stewart jumped into the Senate race not long after losing the primary for the Republican nomination for Virginia governor last year. In October and November of 2017, he spent $1,422 at the Trump hotel in Washington on meals as “meeting expenses.” Stewart said he hosts get-togethers with small groups of “high-dollar donors” there – although at least on one occasion in November, he appeared to be socializing with tourists and other visitors at the bar, not meeting with donors. His FEC report for that period included a bill for $355 for that date. “I might have been just hanging out there,” he said, adding that the hotel has become a “clubhouse for conservatives” in the area. “We like to host events there because there are a lot of MAGA folks who like to meet there,” he said. Notwithstanding his frequent visits there, Stewart said he does not expect Trump to endorse him prior to the June 12 Virginia primary, in which he faces two opponents. Navarro, of Los Angeles, similarly does not expect a Trump endorsement, but said he would continue to use Trump properties. “I’d rather do business in a place where someone has my values,” he said. And — notwithstanding his own website that calls for “an end to accepting bribes” and ridding “corruption/greed” in government ― he rejects the idea that Trump is doing anything wrong by profiting from his businesses while in office. “If he’s not breaking the law, he’s not breaking the law,” Navarro said.",that,include,hotel
"The White House is considering plans to invoke an obscure, Cold War-era law to prop up struggling coal-fired power plants, a move that some say could open the door for Democrats to take radical steps to phase out fossil fuels. The Defense Production Act gives the president broad authority to intervene in industries deemed vital amid war or disaster, including nationalizing systemically important companies to avert catastrophe. In 1952, President Harry Truman applied the statute to nationalize the steel industry and forestall a nationwide strike.  But President Donald Trump is weighing using the law to fulfill a campaign promise and halt coal plant closures, according to a Bloomberg report published late last month. It’s unclear what the program would look like. The Trump administration could spend taxpayer money to bail out some coal-fired plants and require that utilities keep greater stocks of coal on site, effectively nationalizing and dictating the energy market. The White House did not return a request for comment.  Coal advocates, including Murray Energy Corp. CEO Bob Murray and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), have long argued that the natural gas and renewables driving coal-fired plants out of business cannot provide reliable electricity in extreme weather ― a widely-disputed conclusion ― and urged the president to protect the remaining power stations under a federal statute.  Federal regulators rejected the Trump administration’s plan to pass a new rule to bail out coal and nuclear plants in January, and Energy Secretary Rick Perry shied away from a legally-dubious proposal last month to invoke an emergency clause of the Federal Power Act to give taxpayer-backed financing to struggling power stations. But the 68-year-old Defense Production Act could do the trick.  If so, a plan to nationalize or financially buttress the troubled coal industry in the name of averting a crisis thrusts into mainstream debate an idea that has struggled to gain traction but seems increasingly necessary to stave off the worst effects of climate change: nationalizing fossil fuel corporations to dismantle them.  In just the past year, emissions hit record highs and carbon dioxide levels began growing again after a three-year plateau. 2017 marked the second-hottest year on record and the third-warmest in U.S. history. Climate-fueled extreme weather events caused $306.2 billion in damages and killed at least 362 people as the United States suffered its worst wildfire and hurricane seasons in modern history, according to a report released in January by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. After years of funding Big Tobacco-style misinformation campaigns to muddy the waters on climate science, oil and gas companies now largely accept that the planet is warming. But tasked with analyzing the risks that climate change poses their businesses, few firms see ― or at least are willing to admit ― a threat. In February, Exxon Mobil Corp.’s first-ever climate risk report maintained that the company’s products and resulting emissions are projected to rise until at least 2040. In March, Occidental Petroleum, one of the largest oil producers in Texas, issued its own report which, likewise, found little risk to a business-as-usual approach. If such reports seemed toothless, they became even less useful last month after the Securities and Exchange Commission sided with an oil company, allowing it to ignore a shareholder resolution requesting that the firm set targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions.  The debate over how to address climate change has long centered to the right of the economic policy spectrum. Republicans refuse to even take the science seriously and continue ― particularly under Trump ― to argue against the overwhelming scientific consensus that human greenhouse gas emissions are warming the planet. Democrats, wary of the McCarthy-era epithets conservatives are swift to deploy, tend to propose policies that would tweak markets rather than overhaul them, with ideas like a cap and trade system or carbon tax, which were initially devised by conservative economists in the 1980s.  The world has a limited amount of time to avert climate catastrophe. The Paris climate agreement of 2015, the historic first global deal to reduce planet-warming emissions, aimed to keep the Earth from warming 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-Industrial Revolution average. Even if emissions suddenly halted overnight, the Earth would still warm by at least that much, according to research the University of Colorado released last July. In November, more than 15,000 scientists put out a public letter calling for drastic action to reduce greenhouse gases, warning that “time is running out.” And much more needs to be done to counteract the damage already done. All of this fortifies the argument that investors cannot reform fossil fuel producers quickly enough, making the case stronger for severe government intervention in the form of nationalization, said Thomas Hanna, director of research at the Democracy Collaborative, a left-leaning think tank. “Time may simply have run out on other options that we may be considering now,” Hanna said. “If climate change is a crisis, which it will be in the future, all economic possibilities need to be on the table to deal with that, and that means taking over fossil fuel companies.” Hanna and his team estimated that it would cost the government $1.15 trillion to buy the top 25 largest U.S.-based, publicly traded oil and gas companies as well as the roughly four major remaining publicly-traded coal producers. That may sound like a lot, but he argued that could cost less than $200 billion annually over six years, which is slightly over one-third of the military’s current annual budget.  There are ways to reduce the price, too. The Supreme Court has previously ruled that the government is required to compensate shareholders at market value. But if the government announced its plans to restructure companies to shut down fossil fuel production, the price of the shares would collapse, just as stock in private prison companies nosedived after President Barack Obama pledged to phase them out. Federal regulators could also depress the price of shares by ruling that the companies failed to account for environmental externalities, according to a recent proposal from researcher Peter Gowan of the left-leaning People’s Policy Project think tank. Gowan calculated that a discount of 30 percent on current prices ― which is arguably conservative, given the roughly $2 trillion in fossil fuel assets that may never be profitable enough to extract ― coupled with the need to purchase only a 51 percent majority share of the companies, the total cost of buying the country’s largest fossil fuel companies would come out to $410 billion, a little over half the Pentagon’s 2018 budget.  He pointed to British Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn’s proposal to buy the country’s six largest utilities and produce at least 65 percent of the United Kingdom’s electricity from renewables by 2030.  “There would probably be some immediate impact to the global economy as a result of a reduced supply of fossil fuel made available ― in my view, these are necessary to avoid far greater hardship down the line,” Gowan said in an email. “The long-term economic and social benefits of mitigating climate change cannot be overstated.” Yet it’s still highly unlikely Democrats are going to start proposing that idea anytime soon.  Aaron Fritschner, a spokesman for Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), said Trump’s moves to nationalize the coal industry could “get a lot of pushback from the free-market types.” But he said Democrats like his boss seem reluctant to support nationalizing companies to force them to phase out fossil fuel extraction.  “That sounds like an unlikely thing to happen,” he said.  In a statement to HuffPost, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) declined to comment on the concept.  “Our coal communities have powered the nation for a hundred years,” he said in response to questions about his support for nationalizing fossil fuel companies. “We need to honor their workers and ensure they are first in line for the jobs of the renewable energy future.” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), one of the most vocal climate advocates in Congress, declined to comment. Neither Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) nor the Democratic National Committee responded to requests for comment. Democrats are more likely to focus on policies to put a price on carbon emissions and increase fuel economy standards for vehicles, said Michael Gerrard, director of Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.   “The interventions ought to be in the first place on the demand side,” he said. “If the Democrats take over, I don’t see nationalizing the oil companies as anywhere in the top 50 list of things they’d think about.” ",that,need,companies

Most Likely To Succeed is currently being screened in schools all over the country.   Tony and Ted's critically acclaimed book, Most Likely to Succeed: Preparing Our Kids for the Innovation Era, presents a new education vision which puts creativity, imagination, passion and initiative at the heart of the learning process in order to prepare kids for today's world.   Gentlemen, how will the school of the future be more environmentally conscious? Tony: It will have the challenge of sustainability as a fundamental organizing principle of its interdisciplinary science curriculum. The study of ecology will replace other required science courses and will be combined with learning math and social science, as needed. Students will best learn principles of ecology, fundamentals of math, and key social science concepts by studying real environmental issues, both locally and globally. Availability and quality of water resources will be the most frequent problem that students will study. Ted: Lots of students are concerned about healthy food.  I get excited when I visit a school that is encouraging student-driven initiatives around what can be produced onsite, how offerings can be optimized given a food budget, and how to encourage all students to take food seriously.  Or how to reduce the overall carbon footprint of the school and its community.  Kids will learn so much more -- biology, chemistry, math, economics, etc. -- when it's tied to a project they create that seeks to make progress on something they care about. 
""One of the most powerful classroom experiences I've observed in recent years was a ninth-grade social studies class at Beaver Country Day in Chestnut Hill, MA.  The students were asked to analyze what steps the U.S. should take in dealing with the insurgent revolution in Syria.""  --  Ted Dintersmith How will the school of the future be more globally inclusive? Ted: One of the most powerful classroom experiences I've observed in recent years was a ninth-grade social studies class at Beaver Country Day in Chestnut Hill, MA.  The students were asked to analyze what steps the U.S. should take in dealing with the insurgent revolution in Syria.  They scrambled and found a classroom in Damascus with Skype capabilities, set up a class-to-class Skype call, and got feedback directly from the students there.  The perspective these students had on U.S. foreign policy was more informed than that of many adult journalists in our country reporting on developments there.  Imagine this approach being used more broadly, and how it might transform history, social studies, foreign language, and perhaps even science classes here.   Tony: The school of the future will take as a fundamental premise that understanding and appreciation of diverse cultures is an essential educational outcome for all students. Students will frequently partner, via technology, with teams of students from other countries to better understand both local and global issues from multiple cultural perspectives. To use my earlier example, students might come to better understand how challenges related to water quality and availability are impacted by culture, politics, and geography. How will technology be integrated into the curriculum and how will the school handle the integration of continual advancements in technology? Ted: The important advance we need to make is to focus on education experiences that recognize what is readily available to any of us on our smartphone, and not re-invent the wheel.  For example, I've seen a math class that lets kids use smartphones for low-level procedures (with some exposure on poorly-constructed standardized tests) to make room for time to take on challenges like coming up with a sound way to predict the world's population in 2100. Tony: Just as successful schools today employ Bloom's Taxonomy of Learning, schools of the future will understand and employ what I call a new Taxonomy of Technology as an essential tool of learning and creation.  What will be left of traditional craft work and writing? Ted: When formulaic writing can be done by advanced software, few adults will be able to contribute to society by being mediocre writers.  A compelling written voice will be able to make a difference, so our goal with students needs to be to help them develop a distinctive and powerful written voice. Tony: High quality craft work that cannot be replicated by machines will be in even greater demand as societies transition from acquiring a greater quantity of things to having more quality objects and experiences. Demand for beautiful, but practical products -- pottery, fiber, or wood -- will continue to increase as people seek beauty in their everyday lives.  Writing skills will continue to be critical but writing will be increasingly integrated into more artistic and graphics-based presentations for a deeper understanding. Storytelling in written, animated, and movie forms will grow in popularity as people seek new ways to understand the world and one another. Given the efficiency of the Internet and home learning, how much time will students be needed in school? Ted: I don't believe much of anything consequential is learned strictly through online lectures and simplistic multiple-choice questions.  Real learning hinges, to a very large extent, on peer interaction and the impact of engaged and inspiring adults.   Tony: Learning will increasingly be seen as an anytime, anywhere event. Instead of a diploma being a certificate of ""seat time served"" in a collection of courses, students will work towards earning ""merit badges"" representing diverse competencies - much in the way that Scouts do today - at times and places that are consistent with their learning interests and goals. When students are ready, they will present and defend their work in digital portfolios and exhibitions of mastery as the basis for learning a diploma -- much in the way that doctoral students do today. 
""The school of the future will take as a fundamental premise that understanding and appreciation of diverse cultures is an essential educational outcome for all students. Students will frequently partner, via technology, with teams of students from other countries to better understand both local and global issues from multiple cultural perspectives.""  --  Dr. Tony Wagner How important will the presence of physical teachers be? Ted: If we view a teacher as the subject matter expert standing in front of a class lecturing, I'd argue that they're already obsolete.  But if our teachers work closely with students, provide informed and caring instruction and feedback, and help students discover their passions and purpose, they will be - for all eternity - essential. Tony: Students will increasingly study necessary or relevant academic content independently -- often by electronic means. Teachers will be increasingly important as skilled performance coaches. They will help students learn to self-assess and will, with colleagues, determine when students have met the required performance standards necessary for a diploma. Teachers will no longer be isolated, but rather will work together with colleagues to better understand the work, learning, and citizenship competencies that students must master for their diplomas. Team-teaching will be the norm as educators come to understand that ""isolation is the enemy of improvement and innovation."" Will technology advancement lead to further personalization of education to individual students or will it also increase the techno-bureaucratic need for standardization? Ted: People who believe that an ocean of short online lectures, quick quizzes, and big data will advance education are just wrong.  Very little is learned, and almost nothing is retained, with these experiences.  Udacity, to its credit, pioneered the MOOC pedagogy and recognized how little real learning takes place with strictly online resources.  The only reason people conclude that this form of education is effective is that they never reflect on how totally-forgettable their lecture courses were. Tony: Technology will increasingly allow students to be the architects of their own learning.  For example, imagine a student who becomes interested in bicycle design. She or he will study the relevant history, as well as the physics and math of bicycle design, learn CAD CAM and perhaps welding, and then apprentice with a team of innovators who can teach practical skills related to iteration of designs, marketing, and business principles. 
""Students will also learn stress reduction through regular classes in meditation, yoga, tai chi, etc. Perhaps more important, students will learn to listen to themselves and to reflect through one or more of these disciplines.""  --  Dr. Tony Wagner Will we teach students specific ""subjects"" in traditional classrooms like we have today or will classes be more about integrated/hybrid learning? Ted: Most of what's interesting in life is interdisciplinary. The subjects were defined in 1893, and those boundaries are as obsolete as the covered wagon. There are powerful options that cut across traditional school subjects.  What if athletic coaches encourage their players to use math to come up with ways to predict the outcome and score of future games?  To develop their own team constitution laying out how the team will make its important decisions (and, maybe, ease out of the model of coach as dictator), and tie it to the way our founders laid out our nation's constitution.  There are opportunities everywhere to capitalize on passions of students to deepen engagement more broadly. Tony: ""Required"" classes will be increasingly interdisciplinary, with classes organized around understanding a real problem or addressing a big question. For example, students will no longer take US History. Rather they will have a year-long American Studies course organized around a few big questions, such as: Who are we as Americans? What are the most significant influences that have shaped us as a country and a people? And what are the greatest challenges that we face in the future? Students will learn material relevant to answering these questions through history, literature, economics, social science, the arts, and music. Faced with increasing time spent on digital devices, how can we teach more practical skills, including coping with stress levels and interpersonal conflict? Ted: In the film Most Likely To Succeed, students are scrambling to complete their initiatives in time for Exhibition Night, and students deal with all sorts of interpersonal issues that, in a profound way, teach them skills that they'll use for the rest of their lives -- in jobs, in families, and in being productive citizens. Tony: Students will work in teams on most assignments. Teachers will coach individual students as they collaborate with their colleagues, and students will regularly review one another's contributions to projects through ""360"" reviews.  Students will also learn stress reduction through regular classes in meditation, yoga, tai chi, etc. Perhaps more important, students will learn to listen to themselves and to reflect through one or more of these disciplines. Increasingly, students will come to see the value of both traditional Eastern and Western ways of approaching problems.

"LONDON (Reuters) - A global team of scientists plans to scour the icy depths of Loch Ness next month using environmental DNA (eDNA) in an experiment that may discover whether Scotland’s fabled monster really does, or did, exist. The use of eDNA sampling is already well established as a tool for monitoring marine life like whales and sharks. Whenever a creature moves through its environment, it leaves behind tiny fragments of DNA from skin, scales, feathers, fur, faeces and urine. “This DNA can be captured, sequenced and then used to identify that creature by comparing the sequence obtained to large databases of known genetic sequences from hundreds of thousands of different organisms,” said team spokesman Professor Neil Gemmell of the University of Otago in New Zealand. The first written record of a monster relates to the Irish monk St Columba, who is said to have banished a “water beast” to the depths of the River Ness in the 6th century. The most famous picture of Nessie, known as the “surgeon’s photo”, was taken in 1934 and showed a head on a long neck emerging from the water. It was revealed 60 years later to have been a hoax that used a sea monster model attached to a toy submarine. Countless unsuccessful attempts to track down the monster have been made in the years since, notably in 2003 when the BBC funded an extensive scientific search that used 600 sonar beams and satellite tracking to sweep the full length of the loch. The most recent attempt was two years ago when a high-tech marine drone found a monster - but not the one it was looking for. The discovery turned out to be replica used in the 1970 film “The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes”, which sank nearly 50 years ago. Gemmell’s team, which comprises scientists from Britain, Denmark, the United States, Australia and France, is keen to stress the expedition is more than just a monster hunt. “While the prospect of looking for evidence of the Loch Ness monster is the hook to this project, there is an extraordinary amount of new knowledge that we will gain from the work about organisms that inhabit Loch Ness,” Gemmell said on his university website.  He predicts they will document new species of life, particularly bacteria, and will provide important data on the extent of several new invasive species recently seen in the loch, such as Pacific pink salmon. Their findings are expected to be presented in January 2019.  Reporting by Ana de Liz; editing by Stephen Addison",monster,Ness,experiment
"SAN FRANCISCO/ TORONTO (Reuters) - At least a dozen countries are considering or have enacted laws restricting online speech, a trend that is alarming policymakers and others who see the internet as a valuable medium for debate and expression. Such curbs are called out as a threat to the open internet in a report on internet governance set to be released today at an Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development meeting in Cancun, Mexico. The report, reviewed by Reuters, warns of dangers for the global internet, including intrusive surveillance, rising cybercrime and fragmentation as governments exert control of online content. It was prepared by the London-based Chatham House think tank and the Centre for International Governance Innovation, founded by former BlackBerry Ltd co-chief Jim Balsillie. China and Iran long have restricted online speech. Now limitations are under discussion in countries that have had a more open approach to speech, including Brazil, Malaysia, Pakistan, Bolivia, Kenya and Nigeria. Advocates said some of the proposals would criminalize conversations online that otherwise would be protected under the countries' constitutions. Some use broad language to outlaw online postings that ""disturb the public order"" or ""convey false statements"" - formulations that could enable crackdowns on political speech, critics said. ""Free expression is one of the foundational elements of the internet,"" said Michael Chertoff, former U.S. secretary of Homeland Security and a co-author of the internet governance report. ""It shouldn't be protecting the political interests of the ruling party or something of that sort."" Turkey and Thailand also have cracked down on online speech, and a number of developing world countries have unplugged social media sites altogether during elections and other sensitive moments. In the U.S. as well, some have called for restrictions on Internet communications. Speech limitations create business and ethical conflicts for companies like Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google, platforms for debate and political organizing. ""This is the next evolution of political suppression,"" said Richard Forno, assistant director of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County Center for Cybersecurity. ""Technology facilitates freedom of expression, and politicians don't like that."" Tanzania and Ethiopia have passed laws restricting online speech. In others, including Pakistan, Brazil, Bolivia and Kenya, proposals are under discussion or under legislative consideration, according to a review of laws by Reuters and reports by Internet activist groups. In Bolivia, President Evo Morales earlier this year said that the country needs to ""regulate the social networks."" A bill has been drafted and is ready for introduction in the legislature, said Leonardo Loza, head of one of Bolivia's coca growers unions, a supporter of the proposal. ""It is aimed at educating and disciplining people, particularly young Bolivians, and fighting delinquency on social networks,"" Loza said. ""Freedom of expression can't be lying to the people or insulting citizens and politicians."" A bill in Pakistan would allow the government to block internet content to protect the ""integrity, security or defense"" of the state. The legislation, which has passed a vote in Pakistan's lower house of parliament, is supposed to target terrorism, but critics said the language is broad. It comes after Pakistan blocked YouTube in 2012 when a video it deemed inflammatory sparked protests across the country and much of the Muslim world. Earlier this year, YouTube, which is owned by Google, agreed to launch a local version of its site in the country. But now, the internet report said, the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority can ask the company to remove any material it finds offensive. U.S. internet companies have faced mounting pressure in recent years to restrict content. Companies' terms of service lay out what users can and cannot post, and they said they apply a single standard globally. They aim to comply with local laws, but often confront demands to remove even legal content. The new laws threaten to raise a whole new set of compliance and enforcement issues. ""There's a technical question, which is, could you comply if you wanted to, and then the bigger meta question is why would you want to cooperate with this politicized drive to suppress freedom of expression,"" said Andrew McLaughlin, Google's former director of global policy and now leading content organization at Medium. Facebook, Twitter and Google declined to comment for this story.",Forno,said,Cybersecurity
"Segregation and the evil twins–racism and inequity–are the divide and conquer gifts that keep on giving­ to the rich and taking from everyone else. Over the decades, the wealthy and empowered have found ways to dress up their barely concealed essential messages: We deserve what we have. Inequality is the natural order of the world. Caring about others is for losers. Winners care about themselves. If you are unhappy with your station in life, blame yourself. Some of you would be better off if was it not for Them.  The latest incarnation of message obfuscation is the vaguely democratic-sounding term, school choice. The push for expansion of charter schools- publicly funded, but privately controlled– and for vouchers to offset a portion of the tuition for private schools is the old wolf in new sheep’s clothing. Equity and universal high quality have never been the goals of school choice, the roots of which are resistance to desegregation. Its latest advocates do not suggest vouchers so that the poor can attend elite, expensive private schools. They do not demand adequate funding for all schools. They do not want to give students experience interacting with one another across class or race. They certainly do not want to end the defining characteristic of the status quo, rationing of quality by socioeconomic status. Their rhetoric notwithstanding, they have other goals: Undermine public sector unions to reduce their political power, as well as members’ pay and health and retirement benefits; Pander to subgroups to undermine political unity; Undercut the power of unified organizing by offering an escape hatch for the so-called “deserving poor.” Advance the advantages of privilege. Segregation is the simple enabling strategy. Contrary to popular mythology, post-Brown v. Board of education segregation was not so much the product of individual choices, but rather intentionally segregative transportation, zoning, housing and employment policies. Policy and preexisting bias were mutually reinforcing. Increased isolation was the inevitable result. People naturally trust folks they know and interact with regularly. Economic and racial isolation turns the distant “them” into an abstraction, easily stereotyped in the absence of countervailing evidence informed by direct contact and shared struggle. It is the empowered’s Tower of Babel tactic. Sow distrust and hatred, so that even when diverse citizens speak the same language, building for the common good becomes too challenging and threatening. However, unequal education in the United States is not new. Historically, schooling has been inequitable and divided between a free take-all comers public system and selective, tuition-based secular and religious institutions. Expensive private schools provide an alternative for the children of the wealthy to get an exclusive education. Religiously affiliated schools offer another choice, again at parent expense. Historically, these schools have operated mostly outside the public sphere and without significant public oversight. By definition, private schools serve the needs and values of a subset of the population, rather than the common good. Nonetheless, public schools were designed to meet and be accountable for societal purposes. However, because of the tradition of local control and funding, US public schools have never been equitable. In New York for example, while the 100 wealthiest districts spent on average more than $28,000 in state and local funding per kid in 2012, the 100 poorest districts in the state spent closer to $20,000 per student. As long as the bulk of school funding comes from property taxes, education will never be equitable. Schools that are the most well endowed get enriched education and the less well off scrape by– reinforcing existing inequities. Schools do not provide the mythical latter of opportunity but rather reinforce a fixed caste system. Even within public schools, tracking and some special programs facilitate in-school segregation and rationing of education opportunities. During the term of President Obama, there was a push to expand funding for charter schools, despite evidence that they increased racial and socioeconomic segregation and were on average no more effective. The election of Donald Trump and his selection of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education has energized demands for tuition vouchers for private schools. Taken together, these efforts represent a profound bipartisan shift in how we think about the purpose of public support for education and school governance, from meeting community needs and values to attending to the demands and proclivities of individual shoppers in a marketplace. Shopping for an increasing variety of products does not lead to equity. My neighbor has a Porsche roadster. They are available in showrooms. It sure would be fun to drive one, but alas it’s not in my budget. Its availability does not provide choice. More to the point, online shopping provides an infinite variety of products. But more money stills buys higher quality food, clothing, and shelter. The availability of high-quality product choices does not produce equity. In fact, differential quality is an essential feature of a competitive marketplace. Rather than addressing the structural causes of growing inequity, appeals to market-based education play on parents’ anxieties about their children losing out in the intense competition for well-paying jobs. Similarly, school choice rhetoric reinforces some parents’ bias that going to school with certain others will hurt their children. It encourages parents to take a belligerent, you can’t-make-me, stance. Born in 1950, I grew up during the civil rights movement. I remember hearing, “You can’t legislate morality. You can’t force people to like each other,” in opposition to desegregation legislation. With characteristic eloquence, Martin Luther King had an apt response to such arguments: ….we must go on to say that while it may be true that morality cannot be legislated, behavior can be regulated. It may be true that the law cannot change the heart, but it can restrain the heartless. That is that sentiment that provided the moral justification for emancipation, anti-trust, child labor and voting rights laws, as well as employment insurance, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, occupational health and safety and environmental regulations. The current crop of Republicans in control of so many local, state and federal legislative and executive branches want to turn the clock back on it all. President Trump, rather than to urging moral behavior and for people to care more about one another, uses his pulpit to bully and to worship selfishness-driven tribalism. Each generation brings a new Them, but the strategic ideology is clear and consistent: Do not question the structure of the economic and social order. We get the lion’s share. Fight amongst yourselves for the leftovers. Coupled with the exaltation of selfishness, segregation is a time-tested way for the privileged to remain in control. School choice is the latest euphemism for leaving everyone to fend for themselves in a dystopian world of ruthless competition. When centrists Democrats adopt choice rhetoric, they abet conservative ideology. They enable labeling of legislative solutions to help people as being about Them, not us. If the last presidential election is any indication, Democratic politicians are reluctant to take on the rhetoric of choice and the segregation and inequity it supports. That will only change when voters demand that candidates adopt a different, explicitly pro-integration, stance. It is time to bring back the old labor slogan: An injury to one is an injury to all.

"Welcome to ”The Story We Share,” a series of Q&As that profile two people with similar identities ― but who live in very different places. As part of HuffPost’s Listen To America tour, we’re exploring how people’s lived experiences overlap and diverge depending on their zip codes. What is the “American Experience?” It depends where you look.  *** In August 2014, shortly after police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed an unarmed black man named Michael Brown, members of the St. Louis, Missouri, community took to the streets to protest police brutality and racial injustice in America. Three years later, in the same month, white supremacists and neo-Nazis marched on the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia, to protest the removal of a monument to Confederate general Robert E. Lee. When counter-protestors showed up, tensions escalated and turned violent, culminating in the death of an activist named Heather Heyer.  Both of these moments captured the attention of the nation. Photos of Black Lives Matter demonstrators alongside police in riot gear, as well as images of grieving UVA students juxtaposed with white supremacists bearing tiki torches, flooded social media. Despite not being physically present, people around the country got a sense of just how blistering, impassioned and significant these events were.  Eze Amos and Robert Cohen are both photographers who, in their own ways, have been telling the stories of their communities. Amos, born in Nigeria, lives in Charlottesville, where he works a day job as a wedding photographer. But his passion is street photography, specifically, capturing Charlottesville citizens in daily life. With his hashtag project #cvillepeopleeveryday, Amos hopes to balance the negative perception of Charlottesville that has lingered since the August rally by showing the love and unity that most residents believe in.  Cohen, who grew up in New Orleans, now lives in St. Louis, where he works as a photojournalist at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Although his photos routinely depict community life ― from residents’ gardens to county fairs ― he is now known for capturing one of the defining images of the Ferguson protests. In the photograph a black man named Edward Crawford, wearing an American flag on his shirt, winds up to return a fiery tear gas canister to the police who threw it into the crowd. The canister sparkles and pops with golden flames that vanish into clouds of smoke. Cohen and the rest of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch photo staff were subsequently awarded the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography.  Below, Amos and Cohen discuss their lives and work, why they call their cities home and what it means to photograph their own communities.  Eze Amos (Charlottesville): I’m originally from Nigeria. I moved to Charlottesville nine years ago. It was a cultural shock, my first trip out of Nigeria. A lot of things were different, walking down the streets and not having people say hello to me. In Nigeria, if somebody looks like they’re older than you, you are almost obligated to greet them. Even random strangers will stop to greet you. If you do it here, people look at you. Now Charlottesville is home. It’s felt that way since I had my daughter. It’s a really beautiful place to raise a kid. Robert Cohen (St. Louis): I was born in Philadelphia, grew up in New Orleans. After school, I went to University of Texas, had a couple jobs in South Florida, then moved to Memphis, worked for the The Commercial Appeal for 10 years and came to St. Louis in 1999. My director of photography in Memphis took the same job in St. Louis and about a year later he encouraged me to come visit. I decided to give it a try.  Amos (Charlottesville): Charlottesville is a very happy place. People are really cool and kind and open. But I can’t disguise the fact that it’s the South. It’s Virginia. As a black person I can feel it. The downtown mall, it’s a beautiful place. I can walk up to anybody and strike up a conversation. But it’s not lost on me that I’m looking at everybody in the mall right now and I still haven’t seen a black person yet. It’s not any one person’s fault ― it’s how the city has evolved over time. But we need to try to put in more effort. I want to see more than the few black people I see here panhandling. So many black people are working three or four jobs somewhere like this with $12 lunches. It’s not designed for them. It’s a beautiful place but — it still has that. I feel very welcome here, I feel at home here. But I have had my own experiences with racism in this town. Cohen (St. Louis): It’s not the South, that’s for sure. St. Louis is a really nice place to raise a family. I wouldn’t describe it as the world’s friendliest place. It can be a difficult place to make friends. In the South, if you pass a stranger and don’t say hello, they look at you funny. Here, it’s not like that. Amos (Charlottesville): I used to work as a firefighter with the county. It was my first real experience face to face with racism; at that point, I didn’t even have a name for it. I got recruited with six or seven other people and, from the get-go, I noticed I was getting different treatment during the training. I tried to raise the issue with my supervisors, but they just kept telling me I should just do what I’m told. I was being drilled on stuff before I was trained on how to do it. Eventually they said, “You’ve been here for so long and you didn’t complete what we wanted you to.” This was back in 2012. I finally got the chance to speak with the fire chief and he expressed his regret and his disappointment at what happened to me. He asked me if I wanted to come back. I was the only black firefighter in the county. I didn’t know this, I was just two years into the states. I realized after I got fired, wow, I was treated different. That was my crash course. It opened my eyes. In a way I’m grateful that happened to me. It’s made me more aware. Amos (Charlottesville): I became interested in photography back in Nigeria. I grew up around storytelling. I grew up poor, we didn’t have power all the time. At night, without power, we’d just sit around a table and my dad would tell us stories and stuff. It started one day when I walked into the library, where I’d often work as a teenager as a lab technician. I walked in one day and saw a book of photography. There was this black-and-white photo of a dead dove lying on its back. It completely blew me away. I still pretty much only take photos in black and white because of that photo.  I used to draw, but I’d never held a camera in my hand before. I grew up in a very, very poor family. The idea of a camera was a luxury we couldn’t afford. I was lucky to find a friend whose dad’s old beat-up film camera was still in the garage. He dug it up for me and cleaned it off. I took my money and paid a repair man to fix it up and bought my first ever roll of film ― black and white. I couldn’t print the photos. I didn’t have the money, so I just kept collecting the negatives. When I came to the U.S. in 2007 with my rolls of film, the first job I got was at a camera shop. Finally, I digitized my film.  Cohen (St. Louis): I worked for our high school newspaper and, at the same time, I got a job at the local camera store in Metairie, Louisiana. There I was exposed to a lot of things. The guy who ran the photo lab there was the photographer for the New Orleans Saints. He would bring me to some of the games and let me shoot from the sidelines. It was my first taste that someone could make a living doing this. I decided to go to a college with a good student newspaper and journalism program. Cohen (St. Louis): I’ve dabbled in art photography here and there, but for me, it’s more about meeting people and telling their stories, documenting the world around us.  Amos (Charlottesville): The rap group Arrested Development has this song “People Everyday.” I’ve always loved that. I love how much story you can tell from people’s faces alone. If you take a photo of someone from a certain angle, with the light hitting a certain way, you can tell a million stories. It was scary at first ― walking up to random strangers and taking a photo. It’s one of the major things that keeps people away from street photography. It took me a while to be comfortable enough to stand right in front of someone, get on my knee, take a shot, stand up and go away. Cohen (St. Louis): Not really, no. Look, I love meeting people. I love telling stories about our community. You learn so much from just meeting anybody on the street. I’ve been working for a few days now on a story about a police officer and a social worker that teamed up to help the homeless. I guess what motivates them motivates me. You want to use your work to make a difference somewhere in somebody’s life. They want to help homeless people, provide them services and enroll them in programs. I want to have a similar impact in telling readers about our community.  Amos (Charlottesville): I’m a documentary wedding photographer. Charlottesville is a big wedding destination, so I take advantage of that. I try to do as little posed photos as possible. Most people don’t appreciate that until they see them. But they are paying for me to tell the story of their day. Cohen (St. Louis): This [working at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch] is a full-time thing. I don’t do a whole lot of freelance. We have seven photographers left at the Post-Dispatch. We’ll ride that last wave and keep going until we can’t. Cohen (St. Louis): We lose people constantly and it’s changed a lot in terms of the immediacy. With the website, we’re on a 24/7 news cycle and they want everything with more urgency. Back in the day, we’d be casually looking over images for the next day’s paper. Those days are gone. We are in the instant gratification news cycle. With breaking news, we sometimes send photos to our office straight out of the camera. With the new pace, I don’t see a whole lot positive change. You don’t get the time to get deeper and deeper into stories. We will still do projects, where we take an issue and spend a long time looking at it. We still do that kind of work. It’s just a little more rare than it used to be.  Amos (Charlottesville): I’ve always used social media. In the past year I began to focus on Instagram to showcase my street photography series #cvillepeopleeveryday. It’s encouraging to attract viewers from all over the world. I have been posting photos of local protests on Facebook for a few years and getting a lot of shares just across the local Charlottesville community. This was gratifying and made me feel like my work matters to my neighbors. After the terror attacks in Charlottesville, I used social media to push out my images of the resistance. It’s been amazing how some of these images have circulated all over the place, being shared through networks. The hashtag organizing tool has been huge. Cohen (St. Louis): Social media is huge. Part of my job is getting people to our site through any way possible. Twitter, which is the main social media I use ― I’m tweeting out photos, I’m tweeting out links. I’m trying to get people back to our website to use these stories.  Amos (Charlottesville): I’ve been following Jason Kessler since he started the whole push not to get the statue [of Confederate general Robert E. Lee] taken down a year and a half ago, or two years ago. It was a no-brainer for me. I was there for the KKK rally, which was something. It was awesome — in a bad way. I was scared. I didn’t know what to expect. I’ve never seen a KKK guy in his full robe before. When they finally came out, there was something about them that made them seem — eh. They had their robes and some of them were silky, flammable, like if somebody lit a cigarette they would catch fire. I was not impressed. The fear of standing in front of Klansmen was taken away from me when I actually saw them. I thought, oh, this is a bunch of scared, angry, white men. They were posing for cameras. They wanted to be on camera. Cohen (St. Louis): I’m always looking for people that are giving visual cues of their need to be heard, from Ferguson to what’s going on now. The protests are much more organized now. It can be kind of like Bill Murray’s “Groundhog Day,” where you see the same faces out there every day, marching on the same issues. It makes it challenging to find photos that haven’t been done before. Sometimes I’m looking for loud photos, sometimes I’m looking for quiet photos that might indicate these are the people who have been out here night after night after night. There were people arrested at the mall recently and protesters actually camped outside the county jail waiting for their release. We’re trying to cover it from as many sides as possible. There are still a lot of people that want to be heard in this community.  Amos (Charlottesville): The #cvillepeopleeveryday [project]. I’ve always been attracted to the documentary style and black-and-white photography. In my wedding and events business, I incorporate this style and seek out clients who want it, but the #cvillepeopleeveryday project is a place where I fully invested my passion for this work. I started this project before the attacks in Charlottesville, and I never expected it would actually turn into a space of healing for people. I’ve been sharing my images of ordinary life in downtown Charlottesville throughout the summer, alongside my images of hate and resistance. Now I’m having people reach out and thank me for capturing and reminding them of what they feel is the “real” Charlottesville ― not a whitewashed rebrand, but just ordinary people from all backgrounds living their lives day to day in a small city.  Cohen (St. Louis): For better or for worse, I am known in this industry for one specific image in Ferguson. That’s an image that everybody knows and everybody has some reaction to one way or another. The picture itself should have never been shot. We were all going home for the night and there was a turn of events and there it was. It happened. It’s kind of strange because it’s not really indicative of my work. I’m a community photojournalist and I’m much more likely to be seen at a July 4th parade or photographing plates of food for restaurant reviews. We’re doing much more community driven photojournalism and this looks like a war zone image. I don’t do that kind of work very often.  Amos (Charlottesville): Yes. My body of work this past summer has really resonated with people. I think it’s a lot of factors. It’s the fact that I’ve been documenting protest in Charlottesville for years, and protest locally has changed dramatically since the election. We used to be a town where you take your toddler to a small gathering of activists, gathering in solidarity with people being oppressed in other communities like Flint or Standing Rock or Ferguson, and speaking up to connect the dots with our local issues like gentrification or the lack of a living wage for university employees. Now we are ground zero for the national fight against neo-fascism. I’ve been able to live here through that transformation. I also think my style seems to resonate with people. I have a deep love of storytelling through portraiture, capturing the small details of facial and body expressions that reveal a person’s perspective and identity. Through practice, especially this summer, I’ve developed a very distinctive style, and I guess you could say I’ve found my voice. I’ve gained a lot of respect locally as a black immigrant photographer on the front lines. While that shouldn’t be the reason people attach to my images, the way I naturally see the world is offering a perspective that’s not always in the mix. Cohen (St. Louis): It’s changed a lot of things. I don’t know if it has changed my life, but it has definitely made me busier. A lot of people want to talk about it. It’s an important image a lot of people associate with the resistance. I’m happy to have been there in that moment.  People are still keyed in to issues of injustice. Even though we are talking about two different situations, with Michael Brown then and Jason Stockley now, people see it as the same story of racial injustice. The people that were marching in Ferguson in 2014, 80 percent are still out there today. I see the same faces every day I saw in Ferguson three years ago. It’s important for them to see we’re still out there covering this story. Whether we are out on the actual protest lines or doing stories on how the community has been impacted by the protests, we’ve gone in a lot of different directions. It’s amazing to me how much they’ve sustained this the whole time. I did a talk about Ferguson yesterday for the Federal Reserve Bank, and at the end of the talk I said, “If you’re interested in this subject, there is a protest forming right now outside of the building. It’s still going.” Amos (Charlottesville): Art can do a lot. I’ve always wanted to lend my voice in some way to fight racism, racial equality and economic inequality. I have not been able to find a way to do that. I am not someone who would want to be part of a rally carrying big signs. But I can be there to tell the story. I remember when Sandy Hausman from NPR asked me, before the KKK rally came to town, why I was thinking of risking my life going out there. I told her I want to be the one to tell the story of this community. A guy coming from D.C. or New York doesn’t know this city. They’re just like, oh, this small town. I know what this community has gone through. I would rather tell the story than let some random person do it. Cohen (St. Louis): I think I have always been fascinated by the captured moment in time. That, for me, is where still photography trumps all other visual sources. Knowing that people are going to remember these fleeting seconds. Amos (Charlottesville): Right now Charlottesville is filled with so much negativity. That is why I have been trying to push my #cvillepeopleeveryday project, to show average Charlottesville people. This city is full of normal, fun loving people and families. It’s just unfortunate these guys picked Charlottesville to push their agenda. Charlottesville is the base for them to push their message out. Cohen (St. Louis): I don’t think real deep about it. You want to have an impact on your community. You want people to have a new way to look at others ― at the homeless population, for instance. Everyone has a story. If readers see an image, maybe they’ll decide to go out and help. Or maybe when they see somebody on the street they won’t just pass them by. They’ll say hello and ask how they’re doing. I just don’t have any grandiose hopes of leaving any sort of legacy. I just like people to think about their fellow man a little more.  These interviews have been edited for length and clarity.",lot,’s,resistance
"By Marc Lallanilla, LiveScience Assistant Editor: There's a club open to people from all around the world, but you wouldn't want to join: The club is exclusively for people who've survived a lightning strike. Lightning strikes kill about 24,000 people worldwide each year, and about 240,000 people are injured by lightning and survive. But even decades after being hit by lightning, survivors can continue to experience devastating long-term effects. Because a lightning strike zone can carry thousands of volts of electricity per square foot, severe nerve damage is common among survivors, who often report cognitive problems like memory loss, an inability to concentrate and personality changes. [Electric Earth: Stunning Images of Lightning] ""A lot of your routine — where did you put your keys, how did you file this, the multitasking stuff — pieces are missing out of it,"" Dr. Mary Ann Cooper, director of the Lightning Injury Research Program at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told NBC News in a 2009 interview. ""Their friends don't come around anymore. [They] don't understand jokes; they're socially inappropriate. All of those filters are kind of gone,"" Cooper said. Russ Chapman was walking across a parking lot in 1999 in Littleton, Colo., when lightning struck nearby, knocking him to the pavement. Since then, Chapman has been fired from jobs because he forgot to go to work, he often fails to eat and he suffers from health problems, including severe headaches, sleep problems and epilepsy. ""I know for a fact that people think I'm really weird,"" Chapman told NBC News. Survivors of lightning strikes often turn to Lightning Strike and Electrical Shock Survivors International, a group that provides information and support to victims and their families. How to survive a lightning strike The best way to survive, of course, is to avoid a lightning strike. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recommends people follow the 30/30 rule: If, after seeing lightning, you can't count to 30 before hearing thunder, get inside a building immediately (because the lightning storm is close). And don't go outside until 30 minutes after the last clap of thunder. Sheds, dugouts, bus shelters and other structures don't offer real protection and may actually be targets for a lightning strike. Instead, find a substantial building with wiring and plumbing that will direct an electrical charge away from occupants. It's safer to be in a vehicle than outdoors, provided it's a hardtop vehicle with the windows rolled up and not a convertible, according to FEMA. The metal frame of a vehicle will provide some protection (as long as passengers aren't touching any metal parts). Remember that rubber tires and rubber-soled shoes provide virtually no protection from lightning. In fact, many victims of lightning strikes are farmers in open fields riding tractors with rubber tires. If you're caught outdoors in a forest during a lightning storm, seek shelter in a low area under a dense growth of small trees. Avoid tall trees, since lightning tends to strike the tallest object in an area. If you're in an open area, go to a low area, like a valley or a ravine (but be alert for flash floods). If you're in a boat in open water, get to land as quickly as possible. And if you feel your hair stand on end, that means lightning is about to strike. As a last resort, immediately squat down on the balls of your feet, cover your ears with your hands (to minimize hearing loss) and put your head between your knees. Do not lie flat on the ground — it's best to minimize your contact with the ground, since an electrical charge will travel across the ground. If a person is struck by lightning, render assistance immediately — victims do not carry an electrical charge and cannot shock or hurt anyone. Lightning by the numbers A typical lightning flash contains about 300 million volts of electricity, or enough power to light a 100-watt compact fluorescent bulb for a year, according to the National Weather Service. In the United States, lightning strikes kill about 100 people each year and injure about 1,000, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). FEMA estimates that your chances of being struck by lightning are now about 1 in 600,000. Over the past 100 years, the rate at which people are struck has dropped substantially, as fewer people now work outdoors on farms or ranches. Florida experiences significantly more lightning strikes, deaths and injuries than any other state; NOAA recorded an average of 1.4 million lightning flashes per year in Florida. The New England region typically receives relatively few lightning strikes, and California, despite its size, receives just 85,000 lightning strikes in an average year, largely due to its mild coastal weather. And no other region of the world sees more lightning than central Africa: One small African town — the tiny village of Kifuka in the Democratic Republic of the Congo — is hit by lightning about 158 times each year.

"Michelle Obama took a moment Sunday to celebrate her mom, Marian Robinson, on Mother’s Day. In a photo and message post to Twitter, Obama said it was”impossible for any photo to capture” how much her mother has meant to her.

"“Doesn’t Look Like Anything To Leigh ... And Bill” is HuffPost’s weekly recap in which we break down the craziest thing you might have missed on “Westworld.” This week: Season 2, Episode 2, “Reunion.” If the connections between “Westworld” and a certain, mysterious stock image have flown under your radar, we have some new information that might finally pique your interest. Remember, back in Season 1 of the HBO series, when Dolores’ (Evan Rachel Wood) father Peter Abernathy (Louis Herthum) short-circuited after discovering a picture of a woman posing in New York City’s Times Square? In the show’s fictional universe, the photo is a shot of Juliet, sister to parkgoer Logan (Ben Barnes) and the eventual wife of William (Jimmi Simpson and Ed Harris), aka the Man in Black. A mere glimpse of the real world beyond Peter’s robotic realm seemingly caused him to malfunction. Mr. Abernathy’s frazzled moment was a pivotal “Westworld” plot point, so of course the internet went nuts when fans realized the show had apparently used a Getty stock image of a random woman, rather than hire an actress to play the role of Juliet. The photographer credited for the photo is Erik von Weber, a name that sounds curiously like Arnold Weber (Jeffrey Wright), one of the characters on the show who helped create Westworld. Von Weber’s stock images have been used by a variety of websites, including HuffPost, so his involvement in the show didn’t immediately raise red flags. But when fans looked closer at von Weber’s Getty photos, they noticed some other notable pictures: images of horses, cowboys and, most interestingly, samurai, which are all subjects that have a connection to Westworld. Hmmm. Could von Weber have some secret ties to HBO?  Well, something fascinating just happened: In Season 2, Episode 2, titled “Reunion,” the woman from the Times Square stock photo made an appearance on the show. HuffPost reached out to the actress, Claire Unabia, to ask her about the experience of evolving from stock photo subject to “Westworld” actress, and she revealed an interesting detail: According to Unabia, the picture she posed for wasn’t originally meant to be a stock photo. “I’ll be honest with you, I don’t know if they got that photo that way, because that picture, as far as I know, wasn’t for a stock photo,” she said. “I don’t know if that’s actually the way that they got it. I’m not sure. I’ll just put it out there that maybe it wasn’t actually a stock photo.” Though she doesn’t remember all the specifics of the shoot in question, Unabia recalled it was for a job involving some sort of “technology company.”  “It was for a particular job. What I recall was for technology, [an] internal technology picture, so that’s what I recall taking it for.” Uh, “technology”? Claire, are you talking about Delos, the company running Westworld? The actress didn’t think the shoot, which she previously told HuffPost happened about four years before Season 1, was some big HBO conspiracy to take photos of potential “Westworld” stars, but she believes the showrunners “might have had other reasons when they chose the picture.” She is also suspicious about “Erik von Weber.” “I don’t recall that name at all,” said Unabia, adding, “Maybe the name is not the actual name.”  When reached for comment on von Weber’s possible connection to the show, HBO reps said they didn’t know if there was any information to share on the topic. We also contacted representatives at Getty Images, who said von Weber has refused all media requests. But if there is a connection between the photographer and the show, this opens up a wormhole of possibilities. Are the samurai photos on his account associated with the Delos park Shogun World? Do some of von Weber’s other photos hint at future show reveals, too? Most notably, von Weber’s photos include images of knights and people dressed up like barbarians. Maybe these are peeks into a medieval park world, which was in the original 1973 movie and is rumored to be appearing on the show. In addition to the conspiracy theory, Unabia talked to us about what it was like when HBO tracked her down and put her in the episode. So when did you really find out your picture was in the show? It was when [HuffPost’s Carly Ledbetter] reached out asking to talk to me about that and confirm it was me in the picture, and that’s when I found out. What was your reaction? I was very surprised. But it’s a kind of a thing where you feel like when you’re putting yourself out there in a way that somehow it will get picked up by the world, so in some way I wasn’t surprised. When did HBO contact you? It was after Season 1 finished. They had actually a slightly hard time getting in touch with me as well, and then it was a bit of back and forth with them. They asked me to do a scene and send it to them, and I didn’t hear anything for a while. Then they had some troubles with their shooting and script. They went through a lot of things, so their timeline was put off from what they thought it would’ve been previously. Then, they finally called me in to shoot as if I had known I was coming the whole time. Like, “OK, can you come two days from now or tomorrow?” What? So were you able to change your schedule? I did. I was working on some other job, but it was just going to be the last two days of it or something, so I just canceled the last two days and went out. What’s it like arriving in “Westworld”? It was a bit magical. You definitely feel like you’re stepping into another world when you arrive at the ranch. It looks a bit just like how it looks on the show, so you feel like you’ve stepped into that world, and I saw some of the set design. It’s crazy how some of it doesn’t feel like these psychotic crazy scary places, but then when I realize what it was, then I had that feeling like, “Oh my gosh. This is that place, and it looks like that place, and it looks like nothing right now, but it’s very scary.” Was anybody like, “Oh, you’re the person from the photo”? Yeah, somebody — another director — he came up to me, and he thought he knew me and was talking to me. “Oh, how are you?” and everything. And then it was minutes later that he said, “Oh, my gosh! You’re from the picture!” And he just realized it. So what was your character, Juliet, thinking when she saw Dolores? Oh, a world of terrible and suspicious things. [Laugh] That’s what it looked like. As a married person, you know, it’s when you have that look and understanding and kind of seeing your whole marriage or life in a way on the edge. It’s very upsetting. Especially in my house? This woman. She comes into my house? So do you have any theories about the show? My husband has a theory that I’m going to come back as a robot and kill the Dolores character and have a face off with her. But no, I don’t know anything. I’m not holding fast to any one theory or idea. So is it weird that Logan is carrying around a picture of his sister in the park? Yes, I do try to find reasons for that myself. I don’t know. Maybe because there was such excellent history with him and her and the park and his friend that it’s about something more than carrying a picture of your sister. What’s it like going from a photo to being on the show? That’s honestly the way that my life always is. Every year it’s some other new, crazy adventure, and I have no plans for it, and things just happened. One year I’m producing a show for a Fringe Festival in Scotland, and then the next year I’m doing something completely different, some acting thing, having kids. That’s the way we live our life. We’re in the art world and the film world. It’s very unpredictable. To read more of HuffPost’s “Westworld” coverage, head here. “Westworld” airs Sundays at 9 p.m. Eastern on HBO. ",You,’re,picture
"On March 11, 1959, when A Raisin in the Sun premiered at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, Lorraine Hansberry became the first African-American woman to have a play produced on Broadway. Prior to her death from pancreatic cancer at the age of 34, Hansberry also wrote The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window and, with her husband Robert Nemiroff, co-wrote To Be Young, Gifted and Black: An Informal Autobiography. That title inspired Nina Simone to compose a song (with lyrics by Weldon Irvine) that was also entitled ""To Be Young, Gifted and Black.""
 Wikipedia now lists at least 82 African-American playwrights ranging from those who are deceased (Maya Angelou, James Baldwin, Langston Hughes, August Wilson) and those in their eighties (Douglas Turner Ward, Melvin Van Peebles, Adrienne Kennedy, Ed Bullins) to artists like Dael Orlandersmith (56) and Anna Deavere Smith (64), who are still writing and performing their own monologues. While playwrights such as Lynn Nottage (51), Suzan Lori-Parks (52), George C. Wolfe (60), and Ntozake Shange (66) are familiar names on the theatrical landscape, a younger generation of gifted African-American dramatists such as Katori Hall (34) and Marcus Gardley (37) have been impressing audiences with their work. Back when she was enjoying her success on Broadway, I doubt that Hansberry (who is purported to have been a closeted lesbian) would have thought of naming her autobiography To Be Young, Gifted, Black, and Gay. But I can't think of a more appropriate way to describe 34-year-old Tarell Alvin McCraney whose plays, in the past five years, have been presented to Bay area audiences by the American Conservatory Theatre, Magic Theatre, Berkeley Repertory Theatre, and Marin Theatre Company. * * * * * * * * * * The Marin Theatre Company recently staged the Bay area premiere of McCraney's Choir Boy which, although commissioned by the Manhattan Theatre Club as part of a co-production with the Alliance Theatre of Atlanta, had its world premiere at the Royal Court Theatre in London in the Fall of 2012. Following its American premiere at MTC in June of 2013, it has been produced by several regional American theatre companies. As the play begins, its protagonist, Pharus Jonathan Young (Jelani Alladin), who has been chosen to become the leader of the Drew Prep Chorus the following year, is proudly singing the school song at the senior class's graduation ceremony when he is interrupted by a heckler calling him a sissy and faggot. When hauled before the headmaster (Ken Robinson) of the Charles R. Drew Prep School for Boys and ordered to explain why he froze while singing the school song, Pharus falls back on the school's tradition of loyalty to his classmates. He may be a screamer, but he's not a snitch.  Jaysen Wright, Forest Van Dyke,  and Jelani Alladin
in a scene from Choir Boy (Photo by: Kevin Berne)  Upon his arrival at Drew, the first student assigned to room with Pharus had requested a transfer. His current roommate, Anthony Justin James (Jaysen Wright) may be a top jock with smelly feet, but ""AJ"" is acutely aware of the numerous ways in which Pharus has never hesitated to help him with his studies and be polite to his family. Among the other students in the Drew Prep Chorus are:
Junior Davis (Rotimi Agbabiaka) and Bobby Marrow (Dimitri
Woods) in a scene from Choir Boy (Photo by: Kevin Berne)  Most of the young men in the Drew Prep Chorus have been admitted to the school on scholarship and are acutely aware of the opportunities that might be afforded to them by a private versus public school education. For Pharus, whose love of music runs deep, the chance to lead the chorus is not just an honor but a dream come true. He also knows that his leadership position gives him a way to get back at Bobby. Because this is a play about choir boys, Darius Smith's contribution as the production's music director is a key element of its success. Throughout the evening, the ensemble's singing is nothing less than thrilling. McCraney's play even offers something The Kinsey Sicks have never attempted: singing a cappella while nude and taking a shower!
 Following a steamy encounter in which Pharus is assaulted  in the showers by a closeted student (and refuses to name his attacker), Headmaster Marrow calls in a favor from one of the school's retired teachers, Mr. Pendleton (Charles Shaw Robinson), asking him to teach a special class in philosophy and become the faculty sponsor for the chorus. As McCraney explains: ""In black churches, often choir members are gay, but no one talks about it. We hand down this oral tradition that is spiritually charged and politically charged and often conveyed through music, but we look at culturally effeminate boys and don't talk about them as human beings. We think of them as great singers and extraordinary musicians and talents, but their lives, who they are as people, is left outside of our conversations or our cultural consciousness, even to this day -- which struck me because it's not like it happens in a vacuum. What we deem as effeminate or feminine traits start and continue early on. We try to mold and shape them into something else, and when it doesn't happen, we get silent about it.""  Mr. Pendleton (Charles Shaw Robinson) and Pharus Jonathan Young
(Jelani Alladin) in a scene from Choir Boy  (Photo by: Kevin Berne) ""That's extraordinary to me, because I thought: 'How is it possible that we can celebrate someone, celebrate what makes him individual, but also keep trying to make him somehow fit into the middle?' It's a universal thing. It doesn't just happen in the black community -- it happens in all communities. I took this micro-idea and wanted to explore it and create dialogue around it. I think it hits on universal themes of individual versus the whole, but also very intimate ideas that are woven into specific communities of color.""  Jason Sherwood's striking unit set for Choir Boy  With superb lighting by Kurt Landisman and a highly effective unit set designed by Jason Sherwood, Kent Gash's crisp direction of MTC's highly energetic production keeps the cast constantly in action while it maintains a sharp focus on Pharus (an exceptionally smart and talented young man who has figured out a way to be gay and proud without having to lie about who he is). As he has done in some of his other plays, McCraney has written a magnificent confession scene in which, after having been gay bashed in the showers, Pharus opens up to his roommate and describes the critical reward for his efforts that has always eluded him.  Pharus (Jelani Alladin) and his roommate, AJ (Jaysen Wright) open
up to each other in a scene from Choir Boy (Photo by: Kevin Berne)   To his credit, AJ not only reminds Pharus of his many acts of kindness, but comes through like a champ in a touching display of compassion. While MTC has assembled an exceptional ensemble for Choir Boy, I was particularly impressed with the performances by Jaysen Wright, Forest Van Dyke, and Charles Shaw Robinson. Janeli Alladin's riveting portrayal of Pharus is a tour de force filled with youthful ambition, genuine pathos, and undying optimism. His performance is a theatrical gem which should definitely not to be missed.  Here's the trailer:		 * * * * * * * * * * The recent events at a pool party in McKinney, Texas underlined the sad fact that simple everyday activities (driving while black, swimming while black) can appear highly suspicious to white authority figures. Brit Bennett's recent Op-Ed piece in The New York Times entitled ""Who Gets To Go To The Pool?"" offers a jaw-dropping history of water-related racism in America. In Naz & Maalik, a poignant independent film that was screened at the Frameline 39 Film Festival. the action follows two male teenagers who, in addition to having dark skin, are closeted Muslims. Any moments of intimacy between them must be carefully hidden from friends, family, and anyone else who could ""out"" them to members of their community. According to filmmaker Jay Dockendorf: ""The essence of the story, who the characters are, what their struggles are, came from the experience of subletting a room from a Muslim man who was in the closet to his family at the time, but not to me. He and I and his partner talked a great deal about the experience of being a closeted Muslim and his ability to reconcile those two conflicting identities. I interviewed that guy, asked his permission to put the story into the movie, and got it. I don't think I would have made the movie without his permission.""  Maalik (Curtiss Cook, Jr.) and Naz (Kerwin Johnson, Jr.)
walk through Prospect Park in a scene from Naz & Maalik  Whether hustling ""Saint cards"" and lottery tickets on the streets of Brooklyn or taking a leisurely stroll through Prospect Park, Naz (Kerwin Johnson, Jr.) and Maalik (Curtiss Cook, Jr.) must constantly be on the lookout for the police. Yet the two men share the kind of physical intimacy and easy camaraderie which telegraphs an extremely close friendship to anyone who sees them.  Maalik (Curtiss Cook, Jr.) and Naz (Kerwin Johson, Jr.) tease
each other on a subway platform in a scene from Naz & Maalik  Their troubles begin when a white undercover cop (Bradley Brian Custer) attempts to sell them a gun. After Naz and Maalik show no interest in purchasing the weapon, the cop nevertheless reports them to a white female FBI agent (Annie Grier) who is trying to scope out the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood during the ""War on Terror.""  Maalik (Curtiss Cook, Jr.) and Naz (KerwinJohnson, Jr.)
ride the New York City subway in Naz & Maalik  The FBI agent's pointed questions (and the fact that Naz and Maalik give different answers to her queries about their whereabouts on the previous night) help the woman sniff out the fact that the two men are gay. Things take a turn for the worse when Maalik purchases a live chicken for his mother's birthday and insists that Naz slaughter it according to Halal tradition. When Naz balks, the chicken escapes and steps off the building's rooftop, with tragic consequences for a driver at street level.  Maalik (Curtiss Cook, Jr.) and Naz (Kerwin Johnson, Jr.)
in a tense moment from Naz & Maalik  Shaken by the day's events, Maalik thinks about telling his parents that he is gay. After leaving Maalik's apartment, Naz enters the subway carrying his bicycle. Upon detraining, he starts to ride the bicycle on the empty platform but is stopped by the same undercover policeman who tried to sell him a gun earlier that day. Written and directed by Jay Dockendorf, Naz & Maalik includes scenes which could be applicable to any family (Naz's younger sister demanding money to buy her silence about a secret). Strong supporting performances come from K'Sandra Sampson as Naz's mother, Monciana Edmonson as Maalik's mother, Ashleigh Awusie as Cala, and Sholanty Taylor as Shanda. Having grown up in Brooklyn, I was particularly impressed with the footage Dockendorf shot on subway platforms and within moving trains. His camera easily captures street life in New York as well as some of the stranger personalities one might encounter at any given moment.

"From Mother Nature Network's Russell McLendon: As the weather cools and bats across North America prepare to hibernate, a new study sheds light on the mysterious monster that will haunt them in their sleep. Much like Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers and other Halloween villains, the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome in bats is ridiculously difficult to kill, researchers report.

That fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, has killed around 6 million American bats since its debut in a single New York cave seven years ago. It now infects 22 U.S. states and five Canadian provinces, decimating entire bat colonies with a mortality rate of nearly 100 percent. And according to a new study published in the journal PLOS One, P. destructans is a flexible fiend whose survival doesn't hinge on the bats it massacres.

""It can basically live on any complex carbon source, which encompasses insects, undigested insect parts in guano, wood, dead fungi and cave fish,"" says lead author and University of Illinois grad student Daniel Raudabaugh in a press release. ""We looked at all the different nitrogen sources and found that basically it can grow on all of them.""

This adaptable diet is made possible by enzymes that break down urea and other proteins, producing highly alkaline conditions that can burn holes in skin and leave bats vulnerable to further infection. ""P. destructans appears to create an environment that should degrade the structure of keratin, the main protein in skin,"" Raudabaugh says. It can also survive on other proteins and lipids in bats' skin and bodily fluids, the study shows.

While previous studies have examined the fungus's genome and its effects on bats, this is the first in-depth look at its basic biology, according to Andrew Miller, a mycologist for the Illinois Natural History Survey who helped direct Raudabaugh's research. ""Dan found that P. destructans can live perfectly happily off the remains of most organisms that co-inhabit the caves with the bats,"" Miller says. ""This means that whether the bats are there or not, it's going to be in the caves for a very long time."" 
A bat skull lies on the floor of Mt. Aeolus Cave in Vermont. (Photo: Ann Froschauer/USFWS) Heat is one of the few silver bullets for the cold-loving fungus, which only manages to infect warm-blooded bats because hibernation decreases their body temperatures. But since artificially heating thousands of bat caves across the continent isn't a practical solution, scientists are searching for other ways to control the disease's rapid spread.

The fungus does struggle in extremely acidic conditions, Raudabaugh notes, but otherwise tolerates a ""very wide range of pH"" as well as high calcium levels, inhibitory sulfur compounds and other naturally occurring hurdles. Its only significant weakness, aside from temperatures above 68 degrees Fahrenheit, seems to be the way it drinks water, he says.

P. destructans' cells are leaky, making it hard for them to absorb water from dry wood and other surfaces that cling to moisture. But the fungus has apparently solved that problem, since it can draw up water more easily in the presence of degraded fats or free fatty acids — both of which occur on the skin of living and dead animals, including bats. 
A map showing the spread of white-nose syndrome since 2006. (Image: whitenosesyndrome.org) The fungus is thought to be an invader from Europe, where native bats are relatively immune to similar species of cave-dwelling fungi. Scientists say it probably hitched a ride across the Atlantic on the shoes, clothing or equipment of unwitting spelunkers, who may have inadvertently helped it invade a continent full of defenseless bats.

It remains unclear exactly how P. destructans kills bats, but it seems to wake them up too early from hibernation, leaving them to search fruitlessly for insects in the dead of winter. Aside from damaged skin and the characteristic white fuzz on their noses, ears and wings, many infected bats are found with empty stomachs, suggesting they starved to death.

""All in all, the news for hibernating bats in the U.S. is pretty grim,"" Miller says. That won't stop the quest to save American bats, though, which play important economic as well as ecological roles. Insect-eating bats keep a variety of disease-spreading and crop-killing insects in check, saving the U.S. agriculture industry an estimated $3 billion per year.

Researchers with the U.S. Forest Service recently discovered the closest relative of P. destructans that doesn't cause disease, offering hope that science might find a way to defang the fungus. ""Identification of the closest known relatives of this fungus makes it possible to move forward with genetic work to examine the molecular toolbox this fungus uses to kill bats,"" USFS researcher Daniel Lindner said earlier this year. ""Ultimately, we hope to use this information to interrupt the ability of this fungus to cause disease.""",Miller,says,bats
"The lawyer for the parents of an 8-year-old girl with autism released a disturbing video that shows a California school bus driver taunting and manhandling the child. “I’ve been doing work on behalf of physically and sexually abused kids for 17 years ― many times against school districts – and it’s beyond disturbing to me,” the attorney, Micha Star Liberty, told HuffPost. The video, recorded on Feb. 6 by a surveillance camera on a Vacaville Unified School District bus, led to the arrest of Kim Cheryle Klopson, 64. Vacaville police have charged her with felony child abuse, to which she’s pleaded not guilty. Liberty said the family plans to file a lawsuit against the district in the coming months. Klopson, according to police, was transporting a group of students with special needs to Browns Valley Elementary School when the 8-year-old, a second-grader, was accused of blocking the aisle with her leg. “If you stick your feet out again… you are going to be on the window,” Klopson can be heard saying on the video. The incident appears to escalate when the bus arrives at the school. Klopson is seen on the video grabbing the girl’s backpack and ordering her to remain seated as the other students exit the bus. When a paraeducator steps up to the bus, the driver is heard taunting the girl as she cries hysterically. “She’s acting like she’s younger than her baby sister,” Klopson says. “She’s only two, how old are you? One? Oh no, a baby.” Klopson can then be seen yanking the girl up. “OK, so I get to do that again? Help you sit up? Get up,” Klopson says as she throws the girl down. “You wanna crawl, you can crawl.” The paraeducator does nothing to intervene and after a few minutes Klopson closes the bus door, saying, “OK, we’ll be right there.” Klopson can then be seen yanking the young girl around again as she continues to taunt her. “Nah nah nah nah nah,” the bus driver says. “You done? Nah nah nah nah nah.” Klopson then tries to force the girl’s backpack on her. “Please stop it,” the girl cries. “I don’t want to. Stop it.” Klopson replies, “No, I’m not gonna stop it.” The video ends with Klopson dragging the young girl off the bus. “It’s OK, I didn’t hurt her, guys,” Klopson can be heard saying to people outside the bus. “I mean you’re all like ― it’s OK. Bye… I’ll see you after school. That should be interesting.” The incident left the girl with scrapes and bruises, according to Liberty. “Instead of being taken to the principal’s office or nurse, she was taken to her classroom,” the attorney said. “She complained about physical pain and eventually she was taken to the nurse and the nurse reported it to the principal.” Liberty said the family was not notified of the incident until the girl was back on the bus later in the day and on her way home. “The parents asked what happened and they were invited down to the school to see portions of the video,” she said. “They were heartbroken, appalled and shocked.” The Vacaville Unified School District claims they fired Klopson, but court filings indicate Klopson said she quit. The paraeducator who appeared to witness some of the alleged abuse is still employed by the district, according to Liberty. “I don’t know how you can watch a child go through that and then allow the bus driver to shut the door,” she said. “It’s clearly despicable.” Liberty said the bus incident has caused the young girl deep and ongoing mental trauma. “She’s started therapy for the first time at the young age of 8 to try and work through the trauma that she’s experienced,” she said. “She’s having regressive behavior, nightmares and aversions to certain things. This has had a very significant impact on her.” A phone number for Klopson has been disconnected. In a statement to The Reporter News, the school district said, “Please know that we take this matter very seriously and will continue to be forthcoming and collaborative with our families.” Liberty called it “heartbreaking” that “this little girl was educated and trained to use her words and to say if she doesn’t want to do something. She was crying and she’s telling the bus driver, ‘I don’t like you’ and ‘I don’t want to’ because she was doing what she was trained to do to help herself. Yet this bus driver clearly wasn’t trained appropriately and didn’t behave in any sort of accordance with norms or standards.” Send David Lohr an email or follow him on Facebook and Twitter. ",She,having,things
"Jim Bridenstine, Donald Trump’s pick as NASA administrator, appeared to change his tune on climate change during his first employee town hall since he was confirmed to the position, acknowledging that human beings contribute significantly to the warming of the planet.  “As far as my position on climate change and how it’s evolved, I’ll be very open,” he told NASA employees Thursday. “I don’t deny that consensus that the climate is changing. In fact, I fully believe and know that the climate is changing. I also know that we human beings are contributing to it in a major way.” Humans are putting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere “in volumes that we haven’t seen, and that greenhouse gas is warming the planet. That is absolutely happening, and we are responsible for it.”  The remarks represent a significant departure from comments he made only a few months ago during his confirmation hearing, when he stated that humans are contributing to global warming but wouldn’t quantify their role.  “It’s going to depend on a whole lot of factors, and we’re still learning more about that every day,” he said last November. “In some years, you could say absolutely. In other years, during sun cycles and other things, there are other contributing factors that would have more of an impact.” Bridenstine, a Republican from Oklahoma, is the first elected official to become NASA administrator. He was narrowly confirmed by the Senate 50-49, and politicians on both sides of the aisle shared their concerns about Bridenstine during the months-long nomination process. The primary concern was his lack of space experience, Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) said last September.  Critics have also pointed to his climate-denying past. In a 2016 interview with Aerospace America, he insisted that the climate has always changed, countering any human responsibility. “Going back to the 1600s, we have had mini ice ages from then to now.” In a June 2013 speech, he also asserted that global temperatures “stopped rising 10 years ago” and asked for an apology from then-President Barack Obama, accusing him of a “gross misallocation” of funds for climate change research instead of weather forecasting.",gas,putting,planet
"If you picked up the USA Today last week, you may have noticed that international auto manufacturer Volvo has announced plans to build a new plant in South Carolina. This fall, the company will bring its very first facility to North America. South Carolina has become a leader in the emerging auto manufacturing economy, and they're to be lauded for their success in attracting jobs to their state, including BMW and Boeing.  The article, though, and the larger phenomenon beg the question: why South Carolina? Is there anything magical about the Palmetto State when compared to regional job competitors Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, or even Mississippi?   Over the last few decades, the massive growth in the economies (and populations) in some Southern states has been termed ""The New South,"" and the growth of large investments states are making in luring auto manufacturers has led to another moniker: Detroit South.  Alabama has Mercedes-Benz (DDIAF), Honda (HMC), and Hyundai (HYMTF), while Tennessee has Nissan (NSANY), Volkswagen (VLKAY) and General Motors (GM).  Kentucky boasts large plants for Ford (F), Chevrolet, and Toyota (TM).  Georgia has lured Kia (KIMTF), and now South Carolina adds to its BMW (BMW.F) cred with Volvo (VOLVY). My home state, Mississippi, was able to land both Nissan and Toyota under the two previous governors (full disclosure: I was one of them).  These are huge economic development projects that promote a sense of pride and accomplishment from citizens who enjoy working good-paying jobs for these corporations in their back yards.   When auto manufacturers built new plants in the South, their leaders examined several factors to determine which potential site offered the most benefit to the company.  Many of the states mentioned above have similarities in geography, politics and demographics.  So how did they decide? The answer is simple if you look at the USA Today article.  Volvo named several reasons why they chose South Carolina: they were impressed by a well-trained labor force and aggressive education efforts for research and development by state universities, as well as the affordable cost of living, and proximity to international ports.  Also worth noting is the state's transportation and distribution infrastructure that already exists thanks to Boeing (BA) and BMW.  Many of these factors can be - and have been - replicated across the South, but one stands out that puts South Carolina and a handful of other states in contrast with most of the region: a well-trained labor force.  When states invest in education and workforce training, it is an investment that pays dividends over time.  South Carolina spends over $11,000 a year on K-12 students compared to a state like Mississippi, which is closer to $9,000. A $2,000 difference per pupil doesn't sound like much, but over the course of 13 years, this increased investment of around 20% per student on education can have a significant impact on a child's life and his or her future career. South Carolina also invests in early childhood education by offering Pre-K - an area where many other Southern states lag woefully behind. Economic development success stories abound throughout the Southeast. States from Virginia to Florida and North Carolina to Arkansas have seen an economic renaissance.  But the pockets of stagnation demonstrate the importance of education in the workforce. West Virginia ranked 47th in educational attainment and is one of the few states in the Southeast that has lost out on the trend of Detroit's southern migration.  Not coincidentally, West Virginia also ranks last in workforce participation. Louisiana was on the forefront of southern auto manufacturing when General Motors opened a manufacturing plant in Shreveport in 1981. After decades of low educational attainment - largely a product of low education funding - that GM plant survived the auto crisis of 2008, only to be closed in 2012. Early investments in education have life-long impacts well beyond an extra thousand bucks per year for primary and secondary education. According to researchers, ""The foundations of brain architecture, and subsequent lifelong developmental potential, are laid down in a child's early years.""  Early educational experiences are the fundamentals upon which success in later schooling and employment depend.  Instead of throwing tens of thousands of dollars per person to retrain adults to be a productive workforce, they could be spending pennies on the dollar to educate them while they are young and send them down the road to later educational successes - and higher earning potential. Each of these states have the electric power capacity manufacturers covet.  Mississippi has rail for transporting and waterways for shipping.  Louisiana boasts two of the largest ports in the world, while West Virginia's highways and rail systems were a passion of the late-Sen. Robert Byrd - who invested billions on the state's infrastructure.  All three have an abundance of land for development, and state incentive packages to compete with their neighbors. In sum, these states have just about everything, structurally speaking, that manufacturers look for in a new location, except for that one thing they look for most: a well-trained labor force. This is the real investment that moves states like Mississippi and others forward, and without it, we will continue to lag behind the rest of the country in good-paying jobs.",who,are,yards
"This past weekend, the “anti-diversity” manifesto from a Google software engineer leaked. Naturally, it’s prompted a storm of angry responses from the feminist movement in Silicon Valley. I have a lot of thoughts about the manifesto but I would like to address just two for the sake of time. TLDR to the author of the manifesto: I respectfully disagree with some of your points — but I also agree with others. Point 0: I was biologically designed to be an engineer. Contrary to your belief that the lack of women in tech is due to biology, I was actually biologically designed to be an engineer. My father has a PhD in mathematics. My mother was an accountant (and simultaneously the best stay-at-home mom, ever). Her sister also has a PhD in mathematics — as does her husband. And my other aunt and uncle both have PhD’s in Computer Science. I’m not listing my family’s credentials because I think they validate mine — but if you are going to argue that the “distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes,” I’d like to point out that I am genetically predisposed to be better at math and other computational sciences than the average person. And it turns out that no matter how hard I tried not to be a mathematician (sorry, dad), I still ended up doing computer science, with a speciality in embedded systems. In fact, my career is at the crossroads of two of the most male-dominated fields: software engineering and electrical engineering. I’ve written code that runs on the Tesla Model X and I’m still the youngest engineer at my startup, where I write firmware for in-ear computers. If I wasn’t biologically built to do this, then who is? Now, you could easily argue that I am statistically not the norm. And you would be right. So here’s a brief lesson in statistics: I won’t get into the multitude of studies that show that some of the assumptions you make about women are false, but let’s assume for the sake of this argument that those claims about the “average” woman are correct. Statistically speaking, you are describing about 68 percent of that demographic. That leaves 32 percent that are different from that stereotype. So even on some planet far, far away where your assumptions are correct, you would still be alienating 32 percent of the population. For someone who touts classical liberalism as your ideological framework, your logic doesn’t seem to be rooted in reason. Point 1: We are on the same page. I agree with one of the main tenets of your manifesto. Google should create an environment where you feel safe to openly discuss these opinions and beliefs. It’s the only way you can grow intellectually. If you feel like you’re stuck in an ideological echo chamber, then you should absolutely call that out. As a child of immigrants raised in the deep south, I empathize with you on this point. Also , as a soft objectivist, I agree that the smallest minority on earth is the individual. If individualism is one of your core values, then you of all people should be a champion for people like me who are being actively discriminated against for being just that — individuals. Not women. Not feminists. Not anything that’s part of a tribe. Individuals. See, we are on the same page here — you just don’t know it yet. So here’s what I’m proposing: let’s get coffee and riff on Ludwig von Mises or software design or transhumanism. I don’t want to talk about diversity. I want to show you what diversity looks like. This is a formal invite for an open dialogue — not just for the author of the manifesto — but for anyone who feels like the conversation around diversity and inclusion is a one-way street that has you at the losing end of it. I’m serious. Let’s get coffee. Addendum: A special note to Google. Google’s People Operations work is world-renowned. I look to Google as an example for how to build an innovative, inclusive culture. However, this manifesto sheds light on the fact that Google could do more when it comes to creating an open dialogue with people who come from different ideological backgrounds. I fundamentally disagree with this former Google exec, who claims that he would never assign someone, especially a woman, to work with the author of the manifesto, and then goes on to say he would fire him for expressing these opinions. I think that kind of mentality is the root of the problem. Ostracizing people for expressing their opinions creates isolation — the opposite of inclusion. I believe the solution to the problem actually lies within the burning fires of ideological conflict. One of the things that we’ve found to be successful at my startup is an “Article Club.” Every week, a group of us at work, including our CEO, discuss a recent article. We’ve discussed everything from how brain machine interfaces will lead to the singularity to the ethics of antitrust policies surrounding digital privacy. Naturally, no one ever agrees in those types of discussions, but I leave every meeting with a new framework that shapes the way I analyze the world around me. People at my company come from different backgrounds and sometimes we butt heads. But that’s not only ok ay— it’s necessary. We build a complex hardware product that fits four processors on a PCB that’s the size of a dime. There are a lot of ways to design a product like that and most of them are wrong. If we didn’t have the kind of culture that encouraged people to speak their minds, we wouldn’t have been able to build this product. I take the same approach to diversity challenges as I do to engineering challenges: both necessitate respectful discourse. I genuinely hope Google can find a solution that encourages that type of culture.",diversity,want,you
"Shocked. Fearful. Uncertain. These are all emotions that many of us find ourselves navigating after several churchgoers in Sutherland Springs, Texas were gunned down on an otherwise normal Sunday afternoon. So here we are—yet again.  Yet another group of families that will never be whole again. Yet another community that will carry the permanent weight of loss. Yet another moment when our country is plagued by confusion and fear, wondering when close-knit churches, outdoor concerts and nightclubs in our neighborhoods became as treacherous as war zones halfway across the world. Whether our families were directly impacted or not, we are all mourning.  So how do we deal with the reality of violence and the inevitable grief in the aftermath of violence? Here are five things that you can do today. Talk It Out Tragedies often leave us struggling to find the words to explain to our children and, even ourselves, why something so tragic, so seemingly senseless, had to happen—again. It may feel easier to shy away from hard topics like these, but resist the urge. Talk to your children. Make them feel safe. And reach out to people that you love just to remind each other that you’re there. You’ll find that communication is comforting. Take Action  If you have the means to volunteer or donate to support those directly impacted by a tragedy, do it. There is so much to be done for families and communities. Financial support for children who have lost parents and husbands and wives who lost spouses. Meals for those who need to spend days at hospitals with critically-injured loved ones. Counseling for survivors. Search for national and local organizations that may have a need for your much-needed donations of time and money. Pray   Rely on your faith. It is very common to question God when devastation happens. Stand on your belief system for peace, strength and hope for those who must endure the loss for a lifetime. Pray for those families, the community and those on the front lines as grief and trauma affects them too. We must pray for their wisdom as they respond, make decisions and save lives. Emotional and Mental Wellness Anxiety, fear and worry are often the immediate responses to a mass shooting, and our mental and emotional wellness is impacted in a number of ways. The surviving victims who must relive the vicious attacks over and over, the churchgoers across the country who are now terrified to go into their respective places of worship and anyone, anywhere in the world, who is watching the devastation on the news and wondering if there is anywhere to really be safe. If your emotions feel too heavy to carry, first, be honest about it. Then, find a counselor or grief therapist to help, and journal your feelings if that helps. Love yourself enough to release your emotional burdens.   Take a Break  It is good to be informed and aware of what is going on in the world however limit your exposure to the news when necessary. Take a moment to lift your spirits .Strive to have balance, with the consistent tragedies that are happening around the world. Pictures, Videos and images are powerful and you want to be mindful of contributing to any stressors that can aid any distress. Grieve    Remember that grief is a process. You cannot go around grief but through it. There is no set time frame to grieve a loss or particular set of stages one muct go through. Grief is unique. Everyone is different and everyone grieves differently.   Stay vigilant If you find yourself in a threatening situation, as soon as you notice something strange is happening, feel uncomfortable or see a gun once finding a safe place use technology to increase awareness and to alert others. Send a text message, and copy and paste the same message to as many people as possible as well as on social media if you have time. It can be as simple as, “Need Help Call 911”, “Call Police, I’m at church, Terrorist attack” or “Call Police, School Shooter. 911” to give a warning to others. Once hidden or having distance away, if going live is an option, this may show family, friends and officals where to find you. Use media and messaging to reach out as soon as you can. Having access to your phone may not always be an option however in some instances,  use social media as a safety strategy to help yourself and others.

"The clatter of dishes, the murmur of diners, the sizzle of meat in the pan ― “Sweetbitter,” the new Starz adaptation of Stephanie Danler’s novel of the same name, is like a sensory bath immersing the viewer in a restaurant’s humming kitchen. It almost feels like you’re lurking by the kitchen doors in a real Manhattan eatery. That’s because, in many ways, you are. To capture the hectic atmosphere of a restaurant kitchen and the muted glamour of the dining room, the show’s creators decided not to cut any corners: They built a working restaurant as the set ― kitchen, dining room and all. “People were cooking food in that kitchen, and we were carrying it hot in our hands to ― sometimes, when it’s a one-shot ― to diners sitting in the room,” Tom Sturridge, who plays a bartender on the show, told HuffPost. “We couldn’t fake it.” The show premiered on Sunday, kicking off a six-episode season that feels tantalizingly brief, more like an amuse-bouche than an entrée. Like the book, it follows a young woman, Tess (Ella Purnell), who moves to New York City with little money and no particular plan and gets a job at an upscale restaurant in Manhattan. She develops a fascination with a hot, brooding bartender named Jake (Sturridge) and with an elegant sommelier, Simone (Caitlin FitzGerald), who teaches her about fine wine and food. The book is deeply informed by Danler’s time working at the Union Square Café in her 20s, and she brought that same granular knowledge of restaurant work to the making of the show. Every detail had to be right. “Steph was very particular” about everything from wine pairings to place settings, said Evan Jonigkeit, who plays a back waiter named Will. Before filming even began, the cast participated in a two-week-long boot camp, where they learned foundational skills like the three-plate carry (a challenging move Tess struggles with during one episode) and the one-handed ferrying of trays filled with glasses. Danler hired the woman who trained her at Union Square Café to instruct the show’s cast. Some of the cast had the advantage of already having worked in restaurants, like Jonigkeit. “He was a showoff,” laughed Purnell, who admitted to having trouble with the three-plate carry. “He liked to flourish those plates.” With its heady combination of sex, drugs and fine dining, the book was destined to be adapted to the screen. The realism of the show’s portrayal of the restaurant world goes well beyond the culinary details, to thorny issues like how sex, race and class manifest in the kitchen. The result is both seductively aspirational and shockingly gritty.  “I wanted people to be intoxicated but scared the way that you are when you’re experimenting with a substance for the first time,” Danler said of the adaptation. Some aspects may feel even more vivid in an era of increased consciousness around sexual harassment and sex in the workplace. During the first season, Tess, a trainee back waiter in her probationary period, hooks up with more than one of the waitstaff; she also learns that Howard, the manager, has been sleeping with one of his employees. The sketchy and eyebrow-raising moments bubble up but aren’t dwelled upon in the show: There are no after-school specials. “The show feels deeply feminist to me,” FitzGerald said, citing its authentic depiction of an imperfect, “complicated” professional world. Like the book, the show depicts “every single kind of sexual politics in the workplace, from consensual flirtation to drunken regrettable sex to microaggressions of misogyny to outright abuse of power,” Danler told HuffPost. “We just are writing about a restaurant that proves why [the Me Too] movement needed to happen to begin with.” The sensual delights of the show aren’t just sexual, of course ― they’re gustatory. Perhaps just as important as the nitty-gritty details, Danler brought her genuine passion for food and wine to the production, becoming a sort of guru gourmand to her cast. “[Danler] to me is like Simone to Tess,” Purnell told HuffPost. “I’m quite obsessed with Steph.” Simone, an elegant sommelier and server, acts as the wide-eyed new girl’s mentor. She offers her little lessons on appreciating fine food and drink, like how to roll a pricey Riesling around her tongue, tasting the sweet and sour notes. “Now your tongue is coded,” she tells Tess in one episode, after explaining where the taste buds for sweet, sour, salty, and bitter notes are located.  Danler “has taught all of us about wine,” said Eden Epstein, who plays a waitress named Ariel. “We go out to dinner with her, and it’s sumptuous and delicious.” FitzGerald also remembers going wine-tasting with Danler. Not that she’s acquired a mastery on par with that of her character, who during the first episode identifies a wine down to its vintage year after tasting just a sip. “I would say my palate is still thankfully unrefined to a degree,” she joked. (Having a taste for the finer things, after all, can be expensive.) For the actors who had worked in restaurants before, the comprehensive verisimilitude of the show created a woozy sense of familiarity. Epstein started on “Sweetbitter” shortly after leaving a job at Café Orlin in New York’s East Village ― and was bemused to find that, as part of her costume, she’d be wearing a fresh new pair of the same Dansko clogs she worn for years as a waitress.  FitzGerald, on the other hand, recalled leaving boot camp one day feeling inexplicably anxious. “I realized it was because I was having all these sense memories to when I was waiting tables,” she said. “So it felt entirely authentic to me.” For some, the authenticity brought up particularly hurtful memories. Jasmine Mathews, who plays Heather, the sole black server, told HuffPost that her role on “Sweetbitter” mirrored her own experience as the only black server in restaurants during three years of waiting tables. “The racism I experienced was profound,” she said. As a result, she said, she “didn’t have to dig” to relate to her character’s situation.  Daniyar, who plays a back waiter named Sasha, struggled to find work waiting tables when he first moved to the United States due to his lack of fluency in English. His character, also a Russian immigrant, faces a similarly uphill battle to become a server at the restaurant, despite being a skilled waiter. “It’s so painful to look back [at] those days when you felt uncomfortable, when people were mean to you,” he said, recalling the time he spent taking orders at a pizzeria.  “I’m a gay Russian man, completely different than Tess,” he said. But when he read Sweetbitter, he thought, “I experienced exactly the same.” And of course, Tess is the one viewers are encouraged to relate to ― the book is drawn from Danler’s own experience as a naive young (white) woman. In its honesty, “Sweetbitter” escapes the trap of lingering over and romanticizing the winsome heroine’s every misfortune. Whenever Tess herself falls into self-righteousness or self-pity, she’s sharply pulled up by the reality around her: Everyone she works with has their own sorrows and struggles and, yes, joys.  In one scene, she helps an undocumented kitchen worker, Santos, cash his paycheck ― unwittingly pissing off another employee, who had been serving as the bank go-between and skimming some off the top for a while. Her co-workers’ lives didn’t begin when she arrived. She’s just the newest entrant into a buzzing social and professional ecosystem.  So why not focus more directly on characters like Sasha, Heather and Santos? If given the chance, said Danler and showrunner Stuart Zicherman, they will. “We just were just scratching the surface of it,” said Zicherman of the show’s glancing explorations of immigration, race and identity. “We just wanted to tickle it because we really do want to tell these stories.”  In another season, he said, they might do an episode that follows Sasha home and explores his personal life, or an episode devoted to Santos, a character we’ve barely met thus far. “The whole first season is from Tess’ perspective,” said Purnell. “If there were to be another one, we would see it the other way. Follow hundreds of different storylines. The tree will grow, with branches.”  In Season 1, “Sweetbitter” has introduced us to a world of glittering exteriors, but only begun to hint at the complexity of a fine restaurant’s inner machinery. It will take digging deep into the perspectives of all those varied characters to break through.",realism,goes,kitchen
"There is good evidence that the Christian faith in the United States of America is in the process of change and decay. There is a great hymn “Abide With Me” which says “Change and Decay in all around I see, O Thou who changest not abide with me.” That has to be the hope of those who are “spiritual but not religious.” The evidence is that the main line, old line Christian denominations, continue to lose members. Death and desertion are taking their toll. The average in most congregations has to be over 50. The number of “nones” continues to grow among the young generations. Lots of young families just have other things they are doing on Sunday. Even the Southern Baptist denomination notices a lack of growth in their membership. The version of the Christian faith that does seem to still have some vitality is the evangelical religious right of the non-denomination type. The prosperity gospel which tells them that God will give them fortune and fame if they are faithful. There is a version of righteousness that wants to dictate morality to the rest of the world that seems to be appealing to some. This version of the Christian faith appears to me to be a major part of why the Christian faith is fading. There is a meanness in that faith. There is a lack of inclusiveness in that faith. The dictatorial morality would drive a lot of people away from their fellowship. The Christian fraud that would prohibit the building of mosque, the Christian fraud that would refuse to allow certain biological types to join in marriage, the Christian fraud that would prevent a woman from having the power to chose but then have the meanness to refuse welfare for the help with the demanded birth, drives lots of people away from that group. The effort to impose their morality on a multi-cultural society simple turns people off. The really sad thing is that the Christian faith of the first century was admired and flocked to because of its compassion and love and inclusiveness. Gentiles and Jews were welcomed. The public opinion was that Christians were unique by the way they loved each other and people. The early church was made up of the poor and the despised. They had great power of faith and love because they did not have political or economic power. In the midst of a very diverse and multi-religious environment, the early Christian believers were much more attractive. A scholarly study of the times of revival for the Christian faith reached this conclusion. There are 10% of the people who are the movers and shakers of society. There are another 15-20% of people who make feel like they know and can contact the shakers. The rest, the remaining 70% are excluded. They have too much work, too little power, too little education, too little hope and too little energy to be participants in the political and economic decisions. All revivals in the history of the Christian faith have begun with the people in the 70%. In the USA the religious right and the waning main line churches have enjoyed being a part of the upper 30%. The end is in sight for that 30% power and prestige.",effort,turns,people
"Wayne Brady is thrilled to star in the Chicago production of “Hamilton” ― not only because, well, gosh, it’s “Hamilton,” but also because his stint comes at a key time in this country. Just last week, The Huffington Post reported that President Donald Trump’s administration might shut down the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. That means funding for national arts and humanities could decline, or worse yet, all but disappear. Brady, who currently portrays Aaron Burr in the musical, says with Trump in the White House, it’s more important than ever to support arts programming and initiatives, in addition to plenty of other important causes and rights that could be at risk. “It’s happened and it’s happening,” Brady told The Huffington Post. “And it’s going to happen for four more years. And the reality of it is no matter where you fall — if you are pro-Trump or anti-Trump, he is the president. And what are we gonna do?” “I think we need pieces of art like this to keep that fire burning so you just don’t fall into a slope, like, ‘Whatever, it’s four years,’” he continued. “No, during these four years, what are you going to fight for? Fight for the arts. Fight for LGBT rights. Fight for the rights of every minority who gets kicked in the ass with every one of Trump’s cabinet members being placed [in office].” Brady is no stranger to theater, having previously starred on Broadway in “Chicago” and “Kinky Boots.” So, it’s not surprising that the all-around entertainer would make a plea like this. “Go out, support the arts, [support] the things that he [Trump] is killing … By doing ‘Hamilton’ not only am I supporting arts, but I’m in art,” he said. “I’m a trumpeter for the rights of all of us, especially being a black man in this country.”  Of course, one could argue that “Hamilton” ― with its diverse cast and its historical storyline ― resonates even more now with what’s happening in current national politics. But Brady says his interest in “Hamilton” first piqued in 2015 when Lin-Manuel Miranda launched the now Tony Award-winning musical. “Ever since this began ― pre–Donald Trump circus ― it’s resonated with what it means to be an American … Like the line, ‘Immigrants, we get the job done.’ My folks are from the Virgin Islands,” Brady said, “just like [Alexander] Hamilton. It’s inspirational to know that this little chain of islands can produce such greatness.”  Brady stars in “Hamilton” at Chicago’s PrivateBank Theatre through April 9.   ",that,says,risk
"Italian filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci said over the weekend that fellow director Ridley Scott “should be ashamed” for replacing Kevin Spacey in “All the Money in the World,” according to The Hollywood Reporter. Bertolucci also said Scott’s move made him want to cast the disgraced actor, who faces multiple accusations of sexual misconduct. After the allegations surfaced — including actor Anthony Rapp’s claim that Spacey made advances on him when he was 14 — Scott replaced Spacey with Christopher Plummer in reshoots even though the production had wrapped. For his portrayal of J. Paul Getty in the movie, Plummer, 88, became the oldest man to receive an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. Bertolucci, 77, didn’t applaud the cast change. Deadline reported that during a screening of his restored 1972 film “Last Tango in Paris” at the Bari International Film Festival in Italy, he said that when he learned of the move, he contacted Scott’s frequent editor Pietro Scalia “to tell Scott that he should be ashamed” for caving to industry pressure. “And then I immediately wanted to make a film with Spacey,” Bertolucci said, according to IndieWire. At the same time, Bertolucci declared that he fully supports the Me Too movement. Asked about his remarks, a representative for the 80-year-old Scott, who directed “Thelma & Louise,” emailed, “no comment.”  Bertolucci recently faced criticism for a resurfaced video in which he said he filmed a rape scene involving butter with actress Maria Schneider for “Last Tango in Paris” without her consent. Co-star Marlon Brando, whose character sodomizes her in the scene, was also reportedly in on the plan. “Do not believe on social media when they say it was rape. The butter scene was pure simulation,” Bertolucci said at Bari.",he,reported,pressure
" Haegue Yang, Courtesy the artist. At Haegue Yang's exhibition at the Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art in Seoul, ""Shooting the Elephant 象 Thinking the Elephant,"" the visitor will encounter installations and sculptures composed of bright brass bells, electric fans, light bulbs, and Venetian blinds, all involved in a dance of movement, light, texture, and sound. At the start of the exhibition, visitors are invited to don garlands of bells, wearable sculptures the artist calls Sonicwears (2013/2015). In one installation, different scents are emitted periodically into the air. Based on these works alone, one could be forgiven for thinking that Yang's work is primarily concerned with the senses: sight, sound, smell, and touch. But this is just one layer of Yang's work, a surface reading, and while no less true, of course, and no less satisfying, a deeper plunge into the work and its references and dialogues reveals a vast ocean of meaning underneath.  Haegue Yang, Shooting the Elephant 象 Thinking the Elephant, installation view. Courtesy Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art. ""Shooting the Elephant 象 Thinking the Elephant,"" on view until May 10, is Haegue Yang's first solo exhibition in her native country of South Korea in five years. Based in Berlin, Yang is perhaps best known for her installations comprised of arrangements of Venetian blinds--a sculptural motif she introduced in a work entitled Series of Vulnerable Arrangements - Blind Room at the São Paulo Bienal in 2006, and continued to use in installations at the Venice Biennale (where she represented South Korea in 2009), dOCUMENTA (13), and numerous other commissions for major art institutions like Haus der Kunst and the Walker Art Center. Venetian blinds--with their binary properties of folding/unfolding, and transparency/privacy--provide a rich visual and sculptural framework, as well as an apt metaphor, for many of the themes Yang is interested in exploring, including issues of barriers, borders, and dispersion.

Courtesy Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art and Greene Naftali, New York. An astute observer of Yang's work in this exhibition will note the overwhelming prevalence of everyday materials--metal stands mounted on casters, like one might encounter in office furniture or clothing racks, umbrellas, artificial plants, cell phone charms, light bulbs, kitchenware, envelopes, chairs and tables--and note how each element reaches for cultural referents to individuality or community life. A group of light sculptures entitled Seoul Guts (2010) loiters in a corner of The Leeum's expansive gallery, each one an intuitive assemblage of everyday materials draped across a mobile garment rack, standing at about the height of an average person; like a person, each sculpture betrays its individual eccentricities, carries itself in a particular way, and seems to hold on to these personal affects as extensions of themselves. VIP's Union (2001/2015), on the other hand, is comprised of borrowed furniture, serving as an artwork and a rest area for visitors to the museum; the oddly matched tables and chairs, lent by local residents and workers of Seoul, form loose groups and alliances within the space, visually approximating the concept of a community.  Haegue Yang, VIP's Union, 2001/2015. Courtesy the artist. Citadella (2011), an installation composed of 186 Venetian blinds suspended in a labyrinthine arrangement of corridors and rooms, invites comparisons to a village or town, albeit a rather mysterious and dark one. It's here that visitors are misted with scents (artificially composed and branded with comfortable, natural names: Mountain Mist, Ocean, Fresh Cut Grass, Rainforest, etc.), while moving spotlights send roving shadows through the slats of the blinds. A video essay projected within the installation, Doubles and Halves - Events with Nameless Neighbors (2009)--documenting poor residents of Ahyun-dong, Seoul, where the artist lived for a time, and homeless people staying in the Biennale park of Venice in the off-season--provides ghost-like inhabitants for the Venetian-blind passageways.  Haegue Yang, Cittadella, 2011. Courtesy of Kukje Gallery, Seoul. Yang's grandest sculptural gestures in The Leeum's Jean Nouvel-designed space are manifested in three towering straw edifices, modeled after a Mayan pyramid, the Indonesian ruin of Borobudur, and the Russian Islamic mosque Lala Tulpan. Collectively titled The Intermediates (2015), a body of work devised specifically for this exhibition, the sculptures pose in an in-between state, between scale model and real building, between the ephemeral and the everlasting, between the natural and the artificial. The figure statues placed between the structures resemble raffia-wrapped shamans--intermediaries between the human and the spirit world, between civilization and nature. The material of straw was chosen because of its ""universality""--in nearly every culture, no matter its geographic location or time period, straw appears as a familiar folk material--but here the straw is all artificial, made of a filmy, flaxen-colored plastic, thwarting any kind of nostalgic sentiment for a shared, primitive past.  Haegue Yang, The Intermediate - Lion Dance on One Leg (left), 2015; The Intermediate - After Borobudur (right), 2015. Courtesy the artist. Lest one imagines Yang's work casts its eyes only on the ancient past and our everyday present, references to art history also come into sight. At the entrance of the museum, suspended high above the viewer, a new work, a modular Venetian-blind structure, invokes Sol Lewitt by reproducing one of his iconic sculptures of repeating cubic forms, enlarged and hung upside down. And Boxing Ballet (2013/2015) replicates the historic, geometric costumes of the Triadic Ballet by Bauhaus painter, sculptor, and choreographer Oskar Schlemmer, their distinctive forms covered by gold bells.  Haegue Yang, Sol LeWitt Upside Down - Structure with Three Towers, Expanded 23 Times, 2015. Courtesy the artist. But where is the eponymous elephant? Nowhere in Yang's exhibition will you find any visual indicator of the great grey beast. Yang's elephant, rather, is literary, drawn from two written works: ""Shooting an Elephant,"" an essay by George Orwell, and The Roots of Heaven (Les Racines du Ciel), a novel by Romain Gary. In both stories, the elephant serves as a metaphor for nature, and humans find themselves in confrontation with it. Both stories, notably, are entwined in the ugly circumstances of colonialism. This virtual ""elephant in the room"" points to another, very important, undercurrent of Yang's work: her ""interest in how colonial history affects and transforms us.""  Haegue Yang, Boxing Ballet, 2013/2015. Courtesy the artist. Yang's installations and sculptures, in their formal qualities, their materials, and their cultural references, echo the vast human sensorium, intellect, and capacity to create. Whether or not the visitor can catch all the references and underlying meanings to the works, however, is not necessarily of importance to the artist. In a recent interview in Ocula, the artist explains, ""My driving interests and motivations are often concrete, but my artistic language is one of abstraction. Abstraction is, for me, a way of thinking and working through collective and individual narratives across different histories, generations and locations. They coincide and overlap, becoming comprehensible on a personal level in linguistically unexplainable ways."" Understanding Yang's work and its myriad references and allusions, then, is not the crucial factor--it's the experience that truly matters. In the end, Yang's work is primarily concerned with expressing what it means to be human, the nuances of which are infinitely varied and discrete.  Haegue Yang, Cittadella, 2011.

"Kanye West’s shock tour continued Tuesday with an extremely candid interview at TMZ.  The rapper revealed to the newsroom that he was addicted to opioids and underwent liposuction in 2016 just before his mental breakdown.  “Two days before going to the hospital, I was on opioids. I was addicted to opioids,” he said in a video clip provided of the interview.  “I had plastic surgery because I was trying to look good for y’all,” West said, speaking to the TMZ staffers.  “I got liposuction because I didn’t want y’all to call me fat like y’all called Rob [Kardashian] at the wedding and made him fly home before me and Kim got married. I didn’t want y’all to call me fat so I got liposuction, right?” the rapper said. West’s liposuction admission is somewhat startling because his mother, Donda West, died shortly after undergoing a tummy tuck, breast reduction and liposuction in 2007.  After getting his procedure done, West said, he began taking opioids ― two of them a day ― and started driving to work while on them. He also said he used them on tour.  “And then my boy … and I’d always ask my boy, you know, ‘We on tour give me some weed blah, blah, blah,’ so he had to go get me the opioids,” the rapper said. “And there was talks amongst my camp like Ye’s popping pills, so when he handed them to me he said, ’You know this is used to kill genius,’ so I didn’t take it. Two days later, I’m in the hospital.”  West continued talking to the staffers, saying, “I was taking two pills a day at the time. When I left the hospital, how many pills do you think I was given? Seven!” the rapper said, raising his voice. “I went from taking two pills to taking seven. So the reason that I dropped those tweets and everything is because I was drugged the fuck out.”  In the same interview, West also told TMZ about his love for President Donald Trump and said that slavery was a “choice,” before sportswriter and podcast host Van Lathan shut the rapper down. “When you hear about slavery for 400 years ... for 400 years? That sounds like a choice,” West said. “Like, you was there for 400 years and it’s all of y’all? It’s like we’re mentally in prison. I like the word ‘prison’ because slavery goes too direct to the idea of blacks. It’s like slavery, Holocaust. Holocaust, Jews. Slavery is blacks. So, prison is something that unites us as one race. Blacks and whites being one race. We’re the human race,” he added. Kanye with the worst take yet ""You hear about slavery for 400 years. 400 years?! That sounds like a choice."" pic.twitter.com/jJwtByDuyH West later tweeted about his TMZ interview Tuesday evening and appeared to clarify some of his comments. Below are just a few of the tweets:  the universe has a plan. I knew that TMZ would be awesome. the reason why I brought up the 400 years point is because we can't be mentally imprisoned for another 400 years. We need free thought now.

"The holiday shopping season officially kicks off on Black Friday, and so begins that annual hunt for the perfect present, at the best price -- and with the fewest poisons. Store shelves, as consumers have been warned, can be filled with everything from lead-contaminated jewelry and toys, to hormone-disrupting perfumes and lotions. Just in the last month, watchdog groups reported finding potentially toxic levels of phthalates in Spongebob Squarepants vinyl rain ponchos and flame retardants in Toys R Us furniture.  And let's not forget the neurotoxic lead and other chemicals that leach from some fake plastic Christmas trees. Despite growing recognition of toxic dangers that may lurk in consumer products, avoiding these chemicals is another story. Advocates continue to lament weak and outdated federal regulation of toxic chemicals, even though they cheer incremental gains, such as California's announcement last week that furniture manufacturers will no longer be required to fill their foam with flame retardants starting in January. The controversial chemicals are the subject of an award-winning Chicago Tribune series and a documentary, ""Toxic Hot Seat,"" which premiered Monday on HBO. (In light of this news, people with furniture on their holiday shopping lists may want to consider gifting an IOU.)   ""Right now, the dangers are invisible, unlabeled, and a consumer has no basis for making a reasonable and health-protected choice,"" said John Wargo, an environmental health expert at Yale University. ""The onus is on the consumer, who needs to do research product by product,"" he added. ""People don't have time for that and often opt for buying whatever is available."" Some environmental groups are now attempting to make navigating around toxic chemicals easier for concerned shoppers, with a fleet of new consumer guides and mobile apps. A website launched in September, SafeMarkets.org, provides information, tips and resources, such as HealthyStuff.org's database of more than 5,000 tested consumer products. The new site from the Workgroup for Safe Markets, a collaboration of environmental groups, links to other sites, including a new nontoxic shopping guide published by Women's Voices for the Earth and Greenpeace's electronics buying guide.  An increasing number of tools are also available for shoppers on the go. Mobile product-rating apps from the Good Guide and the nonprofit Environmental Working Group allow users to simply scan a barcode. The latter, launched in mid-November, offers iPhone and Android versions of its Skin Deep database, which contains data on about 80,000 cosmetic and personal care products.  ""A lot of people are surprised when they start scanning,"" said Heather White, executive director of the Environmental Working Group. The average American uses 10 to 12 personal care products a day, totaling some 126 different ingredients.  Among the most critical ingredients to avoid due to their hormone-mimicking, cancer-causing, antibiotic-resistance-promoting or development-disturbing properties, according to White, are parabens, formaldehyde, triclosan, polyethylene, phthalates and ""fragrance."" Fragrance formulas are protected as ""trade secrets,"" so their ingredients are rarely disclosed. White noted that the additives often include phthalates. Research published in November added an increased risk of preterm birth to the list of phthalates' potential health hazards.  ""Lip gloss, mascara, perfume. They are popular stocking stuffers,"" White added. ""But there are some serious concerns being raised each day."" An app very similar to Environmental Working Group's is available for mobile phones called Think Dirty. Launched in October, its database includes close to 14,000 products -- primarily ""best sellers,"" according to founder and CEO Lily Tse. A comparison of the two apps by The Huffington Post showed significant differences between scores on the same products. Edge sensitive skin shave gel, for example, rated 4 out of 10 on Environmental Working Group's app, and 10 out of 10 on Tse's. Higher values mean greater toxicities, according to both scales. Tse suggested the discrepancy reflects differing philosophies on toxic chemical exposures.  ""For myself and many others with chemical sensitivity, it's important to stay away if a certain chemical is present, regardless of how much of it is there,"" said Tse. In this case, the presence of PEG-90M, triethanolamine and fragrance put the shave gel in the red.  Tse's advice for the holidays: Minimize fragrance use to protect yourself and others around you who may be chemically sensitive. ""You don't need to overload to show holiday spirit,"" she said. Perhaps no sight or smell represents the holiday spirit more than a Christmas tree. But the season staple isn't without chemical dangers, from pesticides at tree farms to lead and phthalates found in fake plastic versions and on the lights traditionally strung across branches. Yale's Wargo said he will likely be on the hunt for a Christmas tree this holiday weekend. ""I can't bring myself to buy a fake tree. We go to a tree farm every year,"" he said, choosing one that runs sustainably, without pesticides.  Still, Wargo's family falls short of avoiding chemical dangers. He recalled shopping for an extension cord the other day and seeing the ubiquitous warning label for lead. He said he uses old Christmas lights that are also likely contaminated. Mike Schade of the nonprofit Center for Health, Environment and Justice, who helped create the SafeMarkets.org website, emphasized the health hazards associated with PVC, also know as vinyl, used widely in fake Christmas trees, lights and in products wrapped and put under trees. He called PVC the ""poison plastic."" ""From production to use, to disposal, it releases harmful chemicals that are building up in our bodies and are linked to chronic health problems on rise,"" Schade said, listing links to cancer, learning disabilities and obesity, among other conditions. He noted that heat from lights can encourage chemical additives to leach out. Phthalates and lead are among chemicals that have been commonly added to PVC to soften and stabilize the plastic. While some companies have eliminated those chemicals, scientists are finding that organotins and other replacement additives may be toxic, too. ""We don't want to be a grinch,"" Schade said. ""We just recommend consumers avoid purchasing trees, toys or infant products made of PVC, even if they are labeled lead or phthalate-free."" A potential red flag are items imported from China, added Schade. Several such products have been found in recent years to be contaminated with lead or elevated phthalates.  ""But just because it's made in the U.S., doesn't mean it's necessarily safe,"" Schade said. ""Our chemical safety system is broken."" Even the patches in place to help protect consumers, advocates warned, are far from foolproof. While laws restrict certain chemicals from products aimed at younger children, for example, Penelope Jagessar Chaffer warned that parents also need to be cautious about what they bring into the home for older members of their family. Play jewelry gifted to a teen girl, for example, may find its way into the hands and mouth of a more vulnerable little sister or brother. Jagessar Chaffer is the director of the film ""Toxic Baby,"" which will be released next year as an innovative iPad app with additional footage, an interactive map of toxic sites across the country and an encyclopedia of information on toxic chemicals. One of the awards for pledging to her soon-to-launch Kickstarter crowdsourcing campaign will be a toxic audit -- available for Christmas or New Year's.  ""People do tend to buy a lot from Black Friday onward,"" said Jagessar Chaffer. ""I can help them navigate what presents to get, what they bring into their home."" She added that if people plan to purchase big-ticket items during after-Christmas sales, she can also help them manage toxicity levels or even decide if now is the time to buy an air filter or HEPA vacuum.  It's this rise and dispersal of information that experts and advocates said they believe is the key to solving our toxic chemical woes. Wargo likened it to the evolution of organic food. That was caused, he said, by ""widescale recognition among consumers that pesticides are potentially dangerous."" ""As more people are educated, our hope is that they'll take action to move the market,"" said Environmental Working Group's White. ""As the market changes, we hope the political climate changes -- giving more hope for revising our outdated law.""  ""We can't shop our way out of this problem,"" White added.",Research,added,hazards
"The Miami Heat plan to unveil new patches they will wear in honor of the victims of last week’s deadly shooting in Parkland, Florida. The NBA team plans to unveil the new patches, which are still being designed, on Friday, according to WPLG Local 10 News. The Heat intend to wear the patches for the remainder of the season. Last week, a 19-year-old gunman allegedly stormed into his former school, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, and opened fire, killing 17 people with an assault-style rifle and leaving many others injured.  Starting Friday and for the remainder of the season, the Miami Heat will be wearing a patch on their jerseys to honor victims of the Stoneman Douglas HS tragedy.  The design is still being worked on. Since then, a surge of protests have taken place across the state and country, with many being led by students from Stoneman Douglas. They have called out the NRA and demanded stronger gun reform legislation.  On March 24, many survivors of the shooting, along with others upset by the nation’s lenient gun control laws, plan to take to the streets in a march on Washington, D.C., and around the nation. Also on Wednesday, Major League Baseball unveiled Stoneman Douglas hats that will be given to all 30 teams for players to wear in honor of the victims. The hat design is a replica of those worn by the high school’s baseball team. The Miami Heat did not immediately return a request for comment. ",They,called,legislation
"This boils down to a choice, a fundamental choice and the choice is this: Do you take a trillion dollars and help the poor and vulnerable and the working class in this country and their health care, subsidized by the federal government, or do you take the trillions of dollars and return it to the wealthy in the country? That’s really the fundamental choice here. I heard Matthew Dowd say that on “This Week with George Stephanopoulos” this past Sunday. I met Dowd recently. He is a former George W. Bush advisor, and told me he is a Catholic from my hometown of Detroit. He is right. These are indeed about basic choices that are not just political, but moral. It’s time to make some choices. While a vote on the Senate health care bill has been delayed, the proposed legislation is still very much alive. And people of faith should be especially troubled by this serious life issue: Twenty-two million Americans would lose their health insurance under the bill, and 15 million will lose the Medicaid their health depends upon. While the bill was drafted — behind closed doors with a small group of Republican men — to fulfill the Republican campaign promise of “repealing Obamacare,” it goes far beyond that. The most important takeaway is this: The Senate bill, like the House bill, is a Trojan horse that uses the cover of repealing and replacing Obamacare to do two fundamental things: Medicaid is an entitlement program that was passed during Lyndon B. Johnson’s administration in 1965 — five decades ago. Today, it pays for health care services for several of society’s most vulnerable groups: poor people, disabled people, children, and elderly Americans in nursing homes. Here are some of the key numbers. Medicaid covers:  It’s jointly funded by the federal government and the states. For the last five decades, it has been funded as an entitlement like Social Security and Medicare, meaning as long as people qualify for the program, the federal and state governments will pay whatever it costs to treat those who qualify. That now will all change if the Republican health care bill passes both houses of Congress. Federal spending on Medicaid will be $772 billion lower under this plan over the next decade than it would be under the Affordable Care Act, which, combined with other cuts, would go to finance more than half a trillion dollars in tax cuts. By one new estimate the tax cuts that the 400 highest-income taxpayers in the United States would receive in the House version would be roughly equivalent to the cost of maintaining the ACA’s expansion to Medicaid over that same time period in Nevada, West Virginia, Arkansas, and Alaska combined. Think about that: Republican senators are extremely close to passing legislation that would strip away funding for health insurance from some of society’s most vulnerable people, and transfer those funds to the richest people in this country. We are at a moment when our society faces a fundamental moral choice. Right now, enough Republican senators oppose the Senate bill to delay the vote, so they’ll instead try to pass it before the long August recess. We have more time — just a little more time — to lift our voices in opposition this bill and in defense of the poor, the sick, the disabled, children, and the elderly who will bear the cost of this bill should it become law. Senators need to hear your voices. Faith leaders across the theological and political spectrum have made their voices clear about the unacceptable attack on Medicaid in the House and Senate bills. When we as people of faith reach out, we can make a strong religious case for why the consequences of this bill are morally unacceptable to us. Most of these senators who are considering this bill claim to be people of faith themselves — and it is to their faith that we should appeal. Many of these senators are Catholic — like Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), and Pat Toomey (R-Penn.). The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has spoken strongly against this bill, both before the CBO score came out and since its release: Other senators identify with various strands of Protestant faith, people like Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Shelly Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.). A large group of Christian denominations — including the Presbyterian Church U.S.A., the United Methodist Church General Board of Church and Society, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America — signed a letter expressing strong opposition to the Medicaid cuts that are at the heart of this bill: Sharon Watkins, who serves as the chair of the National Council of Churches and head of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) denomination, gave the biblical justification for opposing the current House and Senate bills: Many senators identify specifically with the evangelical faith. Galen Carey of the National Association of Evangelicals spoke last week with the Circle of Protection, stressing the responsibility of government to the most vulnerable among us: Lt. Col. Ron Busroe from The Salvation Army also made a strong statement at the gathering about budget priorities: Over this congressional recess when senators are home and the critical weeks they are back in session during July, we have the opportunity and responsibility to speak up and speak out as people of faith, to other people of faith, including our political representatives of faith. I had the chance to say this to one Republican senator who is an evangelical Christian and believes he represents many other evangelicals. I asked him to imagine a cable news story that reported senators, on both sides of the aisle, had decided they would together protect the poorest and most vulnerable among us — putting their faith above their politics or their parties. He agreed how powerful that would be. It’s that story that I will be speaking, praying, and hoping for. Jim Wallis is president of Sojourners.

"President Donald Trump has picked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s brother-in-law — a man with apparently no government experience and unclear qualifications — to lead a Department of Labor agency responsible for current and future pensions of about 1.5 million people. Ethics experts questioned the choice, with one suggesting the nomination was granted on a “who you know rather than what you know” basis. The White House announced Monday that Gordon Hartogensis had been tapped to head the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. He was described as “an investor and technology sector leader with experience managing financial equities, bonds, private placements, and software development.” The announcement failed to list a current job for the nominee, and did not mention that Hartogensis is the brother-in-law of McConnell and his wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. Hartogensis is married to Chao’s sister, Grace Chao.  Amazing. Trump just nominated Mitch McConnell & Elaine Chao’s brother-in-law to lead the nation’s pension agency. The White House announcement doesn’t even list a current job for him & WH won’t answer questions. Below, his announcement vs. a typical one >> https://t.co/58Vu6GzLwC pic.twitter.com/LL5zsexfuF According to his LinkedIn page, Hartogensis has managed his family’s trust for seven years. He previously served as the CEO and co-founder of software company Auric Technology, his profile says.  Hartogensis, according to The Washington Post, has no apparent experience in public service and his understanding of PBGC’s mission is unclear. The PBGC, which helps to sustain payments on single-employer and multi-employer pension plans when pension funds fail, is currently facing a widening, multibillion-dollar deficit. According to Bloomberg, the agency’s multi-employer program, which backs pensions operated jointly by employers and unions, is expected to become insolvent by 2025.   “The White House’s process for naming and vetting candidates is flawed,” Scott Amey of the Project on Government Oversight told the Post on Tuesday in reaction to Hartogensis’ nomination. “This seems to be another example of who you know rather than what you know.” An unnamed White House official pushed back against the suggestion that Hartogensis was anything but qualified, telling CNBC that his experience as an investment manager “makes him uniquely qualified to run the PBGC.” “Since 2013, PBGC’s deficit has doubled, and he will use his strong business skills to put the PBGC back on a firm financial footing,” said the official. Hartogensis’ nomination requires confirmation by the Senate. If confirmed, he will replace Tom Reeder, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama in October 2015. Prior to leading the PBGC, Reeder, an attorney specializing in national employee benefits, served for many years as benefits tax counsel in the Treasury Department. He also served as benefits counsel for the Senate Finance Committee and health care counsel for the Internal Revenue Service. ",you,seems,what
"My grandmother used to speak in adages, parables, metaphors, similes and symbols. Now I call her proclivity for language, literature and meaning-making “wisdom-speak.” Then, I thought she was being corny. She knew her wisdom-speak was meant to teach me enough until I am ready to know more.  Her adages came from bible verses, poetry lines, and quotes from novels, cultural remembrances and living life as an African American woman in the USA, born in 1887. Folks like Langston Hughes, Booker T. Washington, Sojourner Truth, Pearl Bailey, Jesus, and Sarah Vaughn were regularly invoked.  Wisdom-speak is colorful, witty language — easy to recall and recite, with a depth of multiple meanings. Wisdom-speak is part of everyday conversation. It is a pithy quote or well-placed refrain woven into a conversation like salt on fried fish. It is accompanied by a “hmmm” or tongue click, a foot pat, a shoulder shrug or an eye roll. Wisdom-speak is a body, mind and spirit lesson. Grandmother Vyola would say, “All that is is not visible.” As a child, I thought she meant that there is more to creation than what can be witnessed with the naked eye. If knowing is only about what is directly in front of us, then we miss so very much of all that is. Learning to see the invisible is the task of knowing. Learning the ways of the wind and the saints, angels, ancestors, cherubim and seraphim; the dream world and the day dreaming world; the ways of prayer and meditation are the learning of the invisible.  Then as a young adult, I decided Grandma was talking about identity politics and the politics of domination. The genderless politics of patriarchy, with its racist undertones and dictates, considers much of “all that is” to be too much for Black women, many Black children and most Black men. The truncation of imagination engineered by systems of domination and control renders the capacity of many people as inferior thus negating all that is. Poverty drastically limits opportunities for in-depth exploration. So, when we meet persons who have carved out an education in the wake of social depravity, we should be in awe. As a young adult — straining to see like Vyola sees — I came to understand good teaching meant finding ways of seeing the manifestations of oppression in my own classrooms, church, society and world. And when I encountered Alice Walker, I figured Grandmother Vyola was talking about what Dr. Walker was talking about. Grandmother Vyola is resonant with novelist, poet Alice Walker’s four-part definition of a “Womanist” from In Search of Our Mothers’ Gardens: Womanist Prose, 1983. The first part of the definition reads in part: “….Wanting to know more and in greater depth than is considered ‘good’ for one.” It seems as though Vyola and Alice were cut from the same cloth.  In the last few days I have turned my attention exclusively toward preparation for school. I have my head down as I put finishing touches on my syllabi, design learning activities, schedule guest colleagues, locate films, and order art supplies. My mode is one of efficiency and my mood is closed off. I am, in my planning, working from an attitude of indubitability. I have clarity about what I will teach, how I will teach and what my students will learn.  While immersed in my preparations, Grandma whispered in my ear. Grandmother Vyola says that patent planning is not good for me or my students. She advises that the better way is to be more open-ended — like Jesus’ parables. Allow the students’ voice(s) to affect most aspects of the course design, not just the convenient parts. Consider that you cannot see all there is to see so leave room for your own learning while you teach. Most of all, anticipate that which is revealed will be marvelous, and know it is unplannable but can be readied for. Grandma whispered, “Get Ready!” I have learned to pause when Grandma speaks. I take a second look at my plans and see that I have relied, a bit, on stale redundancy and a few too many current conventions. I recognize that when I start telling myself I know what will happen, what can happen in my own classroom, I am in danger of not allowing for surprise, the unexpected, or the un-expectable activity of Spirit. My grandmothers Vyola and Alice remind me that my certainty is likely a trap. If I plan for only what I know, only what I can see, only for what I can do, then I am not being womanish enough, not acknowledging all that is in the world. With this wisdom, I have begun to incorporate more ways of acknowledging the hegemonic forces hidden in our midst. I have adjusted and added ways that invoke the freedoms of learning for my students — freedoms like their own questioning, curiosity and concerns being integrated into the full length of the course.   I’ve made changes in the syllabus and school has started. I am less certain of my plans and better for it. A version of this post first appeared August 23, 2016 on the Wabash Center website, “Stories From the Front (of the Classroom).”",I,started,syllabus
"WASHINGTON ― From the day he launched his presidential campaign, Donald Trump has made it pretty clear what he wants America to look like. He doesn’t want Mexico’s “bad people,” immigrants from countries he did or did not describe as “shithole nations,” or refugees he says are a “Trojan horse” seeking to do Americans harm.   And he’s made some progress in carrying out that vision. Trump has moved to terminate temporary protections for more than a million people, effectively telling a population the size of Rhode Island to either leave the country or face deportation. He’s looking to make it harder for asylum-seekers to find refuge in the U.S. And Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested more than 140,000 immigrants last fiscal year, while building up a force that will aim to detain tens of thousands more.  Trump’s latest efforts to curb immigration came on Friday, when the Department of Homeland Security announced it will end temporary protected status, or TPS, for immigrants from Honduras. That means 57,000 Hondurans who found refuge in the U.S. after Hurricane Mitch wrecked their country in 1998 will have to leave or find another legal status by 2020.  The move didn’t come as a surprise. In the past year, the Trump administration has done the same for about 200,000 TPS holders from El Salvador, 46,000 from Haiti, 9,000 from Nepal, 2,500 from Nicaragua and 1,000 from Sudan, and for 4,000 Liberians who were in the U.S. on another type of temporary visa. The administration has effectively decimated TPS, announcing plans to terminate its protections for about 98 percent of current recipients, based on the argument that conditions in their native countries have improved.  Trump also put the futures of some 690,000 undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children in jeopardy when he terminated the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program last fall. The president argued he was forced to end the DACA program because it was unconstitutional and said lawmakers should instead create a legal solution for these Dreamers, as they’re known. But those efforts failed ― in part when Trump demanded major concessions in exchange ― and Dreamers remain in a precarious position. They’re currently safe because court rulings have kept DACA running in part, but that could change, and they could yet again risk losing protections that have let them live and work without fear.  That’s more than a million people in total who have been living and working legally in the U.S. who, thanks to Trump, now face an uncertain future, one in which they may be driven out of the workforce, ripped away from their families and sent back to countries ― some of them dangerous ― that they haven’t seen in years. If they stay without authorization, TPS and DACA recipients could be caught up in a deportation system that is increasingly sweeping up people without criminal records. The Trump administration has said repeatedly that no one is exempt from enforcement and that it won’t look the other way if it finds another undocumented immigrant while looking for one of its targets. About 17 percent of the people deported from the interior of the country last year were noncriminals, a massive jump from the year before, when people without criminal convictions made up 8 percent of the removals from the interior.  As the Trump administration works to expel immigrants from the U.S., it is working to make it harder for new immigrants to enter the country.  During the presidential campaign, Trump said that he wanted to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the country. He didn’t do that, exactly, but did order a string of travel bans that targeted immigrants from several Muslim-majority nations. Although courts blocked large parts of the bans, other vetting measures have contributed to dramatically lower immigration levels from those countries. The president singled out Syrian refugees and tried in his first travel ban to indefinitely shut down resettlement of Syrians into the U.S. That, too, was blocked, but Syrian refugee admission numbers are minuscule. Only 11 Syrian refugees came to the U.S. from January to the end of March.  Refugee admissions in general have dropped dramatically, all while the world is facing the largest refugee crisis since World War II, with many people displaced by wars that the U.S. plays a role in. In Trump’s first year in office, the U.S. admitted 53,700 refugees, down from 85,000 the year before and less than half of the number set for the year by former President Barack Obama before he left office.  This fiscal year, the numbers are even more stark. The U.S. admitted only 10,500 refugees in the first six months, which means it’s unlikely to even reach the ceiling of 45,000 set for the year ― which was already 10,000 less than the previous year, and 40,000 less than the one before that.  He would exclude more immigrants if he could. “They’re not sending their finest,” he said Friday of migrants apprehended at the border. “That I can tell you. We’re getting some real beauties in here.”  Trump wants to end the diversity visa lottery, which allows many people from African countries to move to the U.S., and to limit family-based migration, which he derisively refers to as “chain migration.” He is also seeking policy changes that would allow the government to detain and deport more people who seek asylum at the border, rather than releasing them into the U.S. while their cases are being heard.  In sum, the trend is to restrict immigration. “The Trump administration has been very consistent. Wherever it has discretion about a group of people or a program, it tends to err on the more restrictive side,” said Randy Capps of the nonpartisan think tank Migration Policy Institute. To immigration activists, Trump’s goals are pretty obvious. “The jig was up after his comments about shithole countries,” said Greisa Martinez Rosas, a Dreamer with DACA status and executive director of the advocacy group United We Dream. “There’s no mincing of his words, and that’s why we’re not mincing ours. He’s not only anti-immigrant, but he’s a threat to people of color in this country.”  But it’s unclear whether that’s what Americans actually want. Forty-one percent of Americans approve of Trump’s handling of immigration, versus 52 percent who do not, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released in April. There’s widespread support among voters for giving legal status to Dreamers who benefit from DACA, although so far it hasn’t translated to any action from Congress.  “I don’t think a Trump rally represents the majority of Americans on the question of immigration,” said Ali Noorani, executive director of the advocacy group National Immigration Forum. “Yes, people have serious questions about the issue but I’m not sure they like the way Trump is answering those questions.” In addition, Noorani says, now that Trump is following through on campaign promises on immigration, many people experience direct effects on their businesses and communities and it changes their opinion. And there’s only so much Trump can do. The demographic trends of the country would be nearly impossible to stop, especially without major changes to legal immigration that would require congressional action. The Senate has rejected the president’s immigration policy platform, which would have included legal protections for DACA-eligible immigrants but also restricted legal immigration pathways and made it easier to reject people who request asylum.  Terminating DACA and TPS wouldn’t guarantee all of those individuals would leave the country, either. Even without legal protections, both Dreamers and TPS holders might stay in the U.S. because they have built lives here, or because they believe their native country is too dangerous, even if Homeland Security doesn’t. “This is our home,” Martinez Rosas said. “We’re going to fight as much as possible to stay here.” ",We,getting,beauties
"The news that Fiat-Chrysler is the latest auto-maker caught having massively – and probably illegally – exceeded allowable emission levels for its diesels cars raises a major question:  will this crisis shake Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne’s long standing bet against history, in particular against the replacement of the internal combustion engine by the electric drive train? Marchionne stands almost alone in the auto industry in denying the electric future – but now that he too faces an existential crisis over diesel cheating, how much longer can he – or his shareholders – cling to the combustion past? Chrysler, we now know, installed soft-ware designed to deceive emission testing procedures on 100,000 US Dodge Ram and Jeep Cherokee diesels from 2014-2016. It also apparently pulled similar manipulations in Europe. The company has agreed to recall and fix the vehicles, but denies it broke the law – standard operating procedure for auto companies when first caught exceeding pollution limits. Fiat stands accused of having installed similar emission “cheat” devices on much larger numbers of cars it sold in Europe – it’s not yet clear how widespread the issue is, but this feels very much like the early stages of what could be a major scandal. The European Union has initiated legal action against Italy for failing to adequately enforce EU standards for auto emissions testing on cars made by Fiat. And the University of the Ruhr reports that Fiat installed cheat devices on the Fiat 500X, a compact diesel widely sold in Europe. The US violations were clearly part of the company’s strategy to use somewhat more efficient diesels to meet increasingly stringent US fuel efficiency and carbon emission rules while clinging to a vehicle mix very stuffed full of  SUV’s and almost entirely devoid of the zero emission electric vehicles which other auto makers are relying on to average out with their big cars. (Chrysler has consistently shown the worst fuel economy performance of any US auto manufacturer.) Marchionne has historically derided the future of the electric vehicle, at one point urging customers not to buy Fiat’s EV 500 because “I lose $10,000 making every one.”  He is also the major auto executive least interested in producing standards sedans for ordinary customers, cancelling many of Chrysler’s biggest selling sedans and emphasizing SUV’s even more heavily. Without a strong car line, and with no meaningful EV presence, Marchionne really had no choice but to rely on diesels to cut fuel consumption – regardless of the inability of small diesels in particular to meet pollution requirements. Now he, like Volkswagen, is nakedly exposed as having allowed his company to sell vehicles whose emissions kill its customer and their neighbors – a new study this week calculated that the excess emissions from diesels that fail to meet pollution standards already kills 38,000 people a year globally. Now the burden from non-compliant Fiats and Chrysler's will be added to that total.
  The diesel scandal forced VW to make a major shift away from diesels and towards electric drive trains. Will Marchionne follow? After all, the other six of the big seven auto manufacturers are each far ahead of Chrysler in their investment in the electric future. But Marchionne has said that Fiat’s next likely model of electric car won’t arrive until after he has retired; he worries that allowing electrification to get a firm hold in the auto market will open the industry up to new competitors; and the SUV heavy product line he deploys doesn’t offer easy opportunities for early electrification.
  But if he stays his electro-sceptic course, Marchionne is betting even more heavily against what appear to be the historic trends. The two fastest growing auto markets in the world, China and India, have national governments sending strong signals that they plan to phase out market access for the internal combustion engine altogether, perhaps as soon as 2030, as does the biggest market within the US, California. A recent Financial Times story reported that Torotrak, an engineering company which a year ago was lining up contracts with auto makers to improve the efficiency of their internal combustion engines, is now being cut off from contracts because the companies have decided, “the shift to electric vehicles is accelerating and we have only limited R&D money to invest and we are going to put all of it into the electric car revolution.” The head of Shell Oil, one of the ultimate losers in an electrified transport sector, warns that “the energy transition is global. It must be embraced. It is unstoppable.” And it means, he spells out, electric vehicles. “The world needs to make a massive shift towards consuming energy as electricity.” While short-term the scandal is bad news for Fiat Chrysler, its shareholders and its workers, it may give the company one last time to catch up with history – and recognize that electrification is the future of the auto.",makers,were,cars
"This is a very lightly edited transcript from a December meeting between New York Times editorial page editor James Bennet and a number of Times employees. For more, read our story about the meeting. James Bennet: So the op-ed page was created to do a bunch of different things. But it was partly because this other paper was going out of business, and the feeling — in this very New York-centric moment, The New York Times obviously was an entirely print-centric world — was, there’s nobody to keep us honest anymore. You know, we’ll take our positions and there’s nobody arguing the other side. And so the Times very deliberately went out to create a space in our own universe where there would be people taking the other side and where we would, again, be able to cover — and you can see this in the initial statement for the op-ed page — we engage with the culture, engage with a wide range of subjects. And that’s remained the goal of the page and the ecology of the opinion report over time. But what you’ve seen is the kind of regression to the mean, I think, that takes place. And in many ways we became more and more homogenous as the years went by. I mean, all the work was excellent. But I think a degree of sameness set in and to the point where it now — to grievously overstate the case, the idea of debate is, you have one guy for the Brookings Institution and one guy from the Council of Foreign Relations arguing in the page.  And we’ve conducted a number of — there have been a number of really important innovations in recent years, and I point to Op-Docs as really a central one. We can talk about that if you guys are interested. But in a lot of ways the world of opinion journalism has been, as you all know, undergoing a revolution over the course of the last 10 or 15 years. The Times hasn’t fully participated in it. So, what we’re trying to do now, and the sort of project we’re engaged in, is essentially to try — you can think of it as trying to diversify ourselves in four dimensions at the same time, or along four axes. The first is our team itself. So again, the columnists are the most visible representation of this. Each of them are excellent in their own ways and are fantastic as an array. They don’t necessarily represent our aspirations for our audience, let alone our ambition to capture the full range of — one can never capture the full range — but a wider range of the debate that’s out there. This is true of the department as a whole, and we are working towards diversifying our team.  We’re trying to diversify the ways we tell stories, and that’s about breaking out of the boxes that really still constrain us in the print paper, and the notion that what we do is editorials of 500 words and columns of 800 words and op-eds of maybe 900 words. It’s hard to overstate the degree to which that framework constrains us still ― although we’re beginning to push past it and think about other ways of opinionizing against the news. Longer, more deeply reported pieces, incorporating or leading with graphics and visual forms of opinion. And we’ve created a small video unit that’s doing, now, opinion journalism for us, led by Adam Ellick. So that’s story form, second category. Third category is subject matter — another way that we’ve kind of regressed to a mean, I think. Our default game in opinion is politics and global affairs. And that tends to dominate what we do. We’re going to be putting a much more deliberate focus on subject area and kind of diversifying our range of opinion to more deliberately engage with the world of technology, business and economics, and the culture. We can talk more about that if you want. And then the last component for it is ideological range, where I think both on the editorial line and our columnists and a lot of our op-eds were conducting a debate that was often between the 40-yard lines. And this was evident in the last campaign, where — the last presidential campaign, now I am talking about politics again — where, you know, there wasn’t really an advocate for the Bernie Sanders view of the world formally in our pages. And we’ve had fewer voices to the right for quite some time. Now, of all of this work, it’s that last thing I mentioned that’s getting the most attention and the most concern, and the most blowback. But what I’m trying to explain is, it is one element in everything we’re trying to do.  We’ve gotten a couple more — and I’m very grateful for — some investment in the company for a few more slots that’s helping us do this work. But it’s a fairly ambitious reset of the entire operation largely within our existing footprint, and it’s really hard on our people. I mean, you’re going through a lot of turbulence right now. And Tyson can testify to that. I think on the other side of that is a lot of excitement and fun and a real adventure as we kind of get people sorted and get a clear understanding of everything we’re up to, what the ambitions are, and can begin experimenting in a big way. But right now we’re in the thick of it. Sorry, I talked a lot longer than I meant to. That’s the overall — did I leave anything out?  NYT employee: Can I ask you a question? Can you talk about some of the things that you’re really most proud of, or some of the biggest things you feel like you’ve been able to do since you’ve been here? Even if maybe they’re the most challenging at the same time. Bennet: I wouldn’t say there’s anything I’m particularly proud of. I’m really grateful for the way that my colleagues have kind of risen to the occasion here. I mean, again, it’s been hard, because everybody’s job is changing, and our people just all lost their offices. I mean, talk about a first-class problem, but it is a problem. If you’re a columnist at The New York Times, part of what goes with that is you have an office. And one day, you get it taken away — and editorial board members, too. We still have members of the editorial board who lament the offices that we had on 43rd Street, which were sort of, I don’t know, baronial — fires in the [inaudible] and dogs on the floor, and somebody — anyway. I think there’s some work we’ve been doing lately, there’s been some pieces — our graphics team is super strong. It’s two people, basically, right now. But I can point you to some examples of specific pieces, like the big piece about the opening up of this last Alaskan wilderness that we were able to do in a really — we just didn’t have the ability to tell a story that way just a few months ago. And it was really dynamic and powerful. And we’re doing more of that kind of work more regularly. I’m super happy with the work that Michelle Goldberg is doing. She’s a columnist for us, and Lindy West, who’s another new — she’s a weekly voice that we’ve added. And when I imagine a counterfactual, which is, again, I don’t know if you guys have had time to read any of this stuff, I know we’re all super busy. But we’ve got a bunch more very strong — going through this Harvey Weinstein moment without them, we would have done some really good work, but when I try to imagine what that would have been like, it feels like our report would have been really impoverished. So in a way, both these things are sort of proof of concept to me of how much more exciting it’s going to be when we represent a wider range. I feel the same way about Bret’s work for us. I know that there was a lot of — and I experienced it — a lot of criticism and concern about him. And you guys may disagree or there may be people who do, but I just think he’s an exceptional writer and thinker. I don’t agree with him a lot of the time. But I like to read him, so. And one thing that’s hard here, by the way, is that among the things we’re asking of people is — and I’ve had this experience before elsewhere — is, it’s a really hard thing to ask people who disagree with each other to work with each other. You know? And particularly with opinion journalism, these are people who are paid to have very, very strong convictions, and to believe that they’re right.  And then you want to put them together and say, “OK now we want to treat each other civilly and be good colleagues.” And that can be a difficult thing. But again, people are, I think — and, Tyson, correct me if I’m wrong — they’re making it work. We’ve had some explosions, but culturally it’s real, it’s actually a challenge internally. And if you ask me what I’m proud of, I’m proud of the way people have — I was not proud of some of the moments along the way. But in general, I think people handled that with the grace and dignity we would expect from people at The New York Times. NYT employee: I’m keeping an eye on Slack in case there are questions, but I guess what I’ll ask you is that — so you alluded earlier to a lot of, sort of, sameness, you know, among the opinions, like, across the board in media previously. How do you feel like the Times is currently — in your opinion section, that you’re running — how is it differentiating itself from, say, other publications? Bennet: This is where we’re trying to get. If you, um... I think, in general, what we’ve seen is that there are not very many places that have the ambition of putting people with very different points of view into conversation with each other. That may be because it’s a bad idea. I think it’s also because it’s hard to do that. And other publications simply don’t have the same sense of purpose around this that The New York Times has. Particularly the digital upstarts that have come along. The startups, generally, and serious players over the course of the last 15 or 20 years tend to have a point of view on the world and drive that point of view through everything that they’re doing. In the print world, it’s the approach that The Economist has taken, and arguably, it’s kind of what The New Yorker is, in the print world. And if you imagine two axes — and this is Tyson’s visual representation of this — where you put digital and print on two of the extremes and a single point of view and many voices on the other, and you sort publications that way, what you find is that one quadrant is almost entirely empty, which is digital and lots of points of view. One exception to that is media, which is open to everybody and obviously not a curated space. When we think about the competitive landscape, if there’s one publication I would say is maybe ahead of us here is The Washington Post, which scares me, and they’re moving into that space. And there’s a lot of risk here for us. I mean, this is where we need to go to be consistent with — and I think there’s an intuition and a faith that we’re not reaching a lot of readers who might otherwise appreciate Times journalism, partly because they feel like they don’t recognize themselves in our opinion report. That said, we could piss a lot of people off, you know, doing this work. And we don’t have very good measures of the risk or the reward. But I mean, I’m sorry, again, I’m talking way too much. I guess, to sort of answer your question, it feels like a very — the reason we’re driving towards this position is, it is both true to what... it’s authentic. It’s what we’re supposed to do. The third reason actually is true. It’s true to who we’re supposed to be. And it feels very differentiated. Nobody else is doing it.  The third reason I would say is, I just think it — the world needs this from us right now. You know it is, it is cutting against, and I don’t mean to sound pious, but it really is true that this is a crude and dangerously polarized time. And this is where it’s journalistically true to the ambitions of the Times, to approach opinion in this way. The notion that anybody has a monopoly on what the right answers are is just a dangerous kind of form of hubris that too many of us are really falling prey to right now. And you look what’s happening in the world, the sort of crackup of ideologies, of political parties. Neither party really makes sense, I don’t think, right now, in the U.S., ideologically, and there are big questions about trade, for example, that have been reopened. And to simply assert that we know what the right answers are is not good for the democracy. So I think trying to show that it’s possible, both to have strong convictions and an open mind to other people’s egos, is a valuable contribution that we can make. NYT employee: So there are questions in Slack, but I don’t want to monopolize. So it’s kind of variations on the same question, so I’m just going to pick one. So, media literacy is a big problem. We see and understand the differences between the op-ed and editorial, but how do you communicate to readers and critics, and keep from sending mixed signals to the world? Bennet: I think we do a really bad job of this right now. I think, a) I think those categories — these are the sorts of categories that make sense to us and don’t make any sense to other people. Like, what is an op-ed? I’d kind of like to stop using that word, even internally, but we’re stuck with it. What is an editorial? We have been talking too long now, even in the time I’ve been here, about doing a better job of communicating this to readers. And we’re still not actually doing it very well. Partly, it requires product solutions that have so far eluded our grasp. But I think every piece that goes out to us needs to be very clearly labeled. Not just labeled “opinion,” which right there we have a problem, particularly in social. But we’ve gotten a little better there. But then, it needs to carry a description of what it is. That’s particularly true of editorials, but also other pieces of opinion. And right now, if you, I mean, you know, more than 80 percent of our readers encounter one piece of opinion from The New York Times a month, and that is their only exposure to Times opinion. And if that is a piece by Charles Blow or a piece by Bret Stephens or a piece by Erik Prince, you will form your opinion of who we are based on that one encounter with that one ambassador of our content. And this is... I mean, everybody has this problem: Somehow we have to do a better job at the atomic level of the individual piece of communicating a version of what it just took me 15 minutes to explain to you guys. So I’d welcome any suggestions on how to do that. One of the areas — I mean, small thing, but where I envy the Post right now — and I don’t know how good or effective it is — but they’ve built a little bit of [artificial intelligence] into their... and I don’t know what level. But they are now able to automate serving up not just one argument, but the counterargument with it. So the related links are right there. Whether anybody uses those links or not, it’s a nice statement about the brand and the ambition ― that we’re giving you this point of view, and here’s somebody who disagrees with it in one package, should you choose to go there. That’s the kind of thing, you know, we should be doing, I think. NYT employee: One of the questions on here is around the advocacy that you described. Can you talk a little bit about that? Bennet: This was related to the tax bill, which we’ve been editorializing against. And the voice of the editorial board went onto Twitter to do direct advocacy on it, urging holdout senators who agreed with a number of the positions that we’ve taken on what it would do to the deficit, and how it was shifting the burden of taxation, and the specific issues it didn’t deal with. They each had a different specific issue to stand their ground. It was the kind of experiment that I’ve been encouraging our people to do. And I’m still not sure we’ve learned from it. It had — and, Tyson, you weigh in here, you have a better sense. It had, it had a very big impact. It got a lot of people talking. It pissed off our colleagues in the Washington bureau hugely, because it felt to everybody like a more direct form of advocacy than we traditionally do. In reality, I’ve yet to — and maybe one of you can do this — I’ve yet to get the explanation for why that’s the case. The principled explanation for why this was more direct. Like, we editorialized for this specific election in defeat of a given candidate. We editorialize and say “You should go throw this bum out of office.” That, to me, is as direct a form of advocacy as we could possibly do. Saying “Go call the senator and urge them to stick to their principles” feels like a much less direct form of advocacy. Yet it didn’t... I mean, I can argue logically that it’s a much — I think I’m right. But it felt — and I think it felt that way because it’s just different than anything we’ve done before. It was therefore shocking people and upsetting. But I’m still scratching around to try to figure out where the violation of principle is here.  Tyson Evans, senior editor, opinion products and strategy: I think that was key. Part of the problem in evaluating it is we don’t really have anything to compare it to, because we haven’t done anything similar, so it’s hard to know what size of impact it was supposed to have. I think in the spirit of this moment where we’re trying to say, the form of an editorial is so purely a print construct over the last century, that we’re asking, who are these editorials for? And what action are we trying cause by writing them? And what’s the value of the institution taking a position on something in a moment where it’s just a lot easier for this industry to do something when they feel compelled to do it. When they read a well-written, persuasive argument. Those are the facts on the ground and I think we’re still wrestling with what to do with it, and what’s the capital we have, how many times a year. The Guardian kind of plowed the way forward with this a couple years ago with their “Keep it in the ground” campaign, which was very, very driven over the course of one or two years, I think. [inaudible] It was a really concentrated effort of advocacy and trying to mobilize the citizenship to divest and persuade their legislative groups. So I don’t know, I think we’re early, and we’d love input on what’s the right way to do it, what are the right moments. Bennet: There are definitely some tactical things that we would do differently if we do this again. And we were able to have an impact. I mean, we did jam the switchboards on Capitol Hill, which is a more tangible outcome than we often get when we editorialize, so. And then we got some pushback from some readers, and some from our colleagues. And from individual senators, who were really pissed. [Sen.] Susan Collins [R-Maine] was just — but, you know. NYT employee: I mean, maybe to build on this point ― you started by talking about creating a place for civil debate. There is something about this that says, “But we’re also going to go and take some proactive actions beyond civil debate and push one side of the agenda.” And how do you think about the editorial page within that debate?  Bennet: Well, part of the goal of having more debate is, again, the, you know, basically making the editorial line a little more relevant in some ways. Because if we’re all agreeing with each other, what’s the point of having editorials? I think the first-order question is, what’s the point of having editorials? And here’s what I think, is that it saves us from more of the real moral hazards in the opinion environment in which we want to say, we want to convene lots of voices from lots of points of view. I would worry and personally be concerned about saying we’re indifferent to what the right answer is, right? We don’t just want to let a thousand flowers bloom, let a thousand schools of thought contend, and we’ll just provide the platform. In which there is one version of this, in which [inaudible], I think the conversation will continue about whether that’s actually the right outcome. What the editorials allow us to do, is to say on matters of real consequence, where for one reason or another, this institution has felt a kind of historic connection, the Times is going to come down. And God knows, we argued against women’s suffrage on the editorial page of The New York Times, so we should be humble every time we write one of these about whether we’re actually right. But on big questions, you know, climate change — I think this tax bill actually qualifies. I didn’t mention this, but one of the things we’re trying to do is — and we have done, actually — is lower the key. You know, the last — since time immemorial now, it’s three editorials a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. We’re reducing the cadence, so there are fewer of them. And then this is something David has pressed me for for a long time, is, so what are the issues that The New York Times should be engaging with? [Note to readers: We’re not sure who “David” is.] I mean, I think there’s... the three fundamental, you know, values that guide the editorial on is — and I’m still wrestling with all of these questions, and I’ve not done a good enough job of distilling any of this — but we’re concerned about honesty, fairness and progress. Right? And those things can actually be thought of as usefully in tension with each other. For example, take particularly progress and fairness. I mean, I think we are pro-capitalism. The New York Times is in favor of capitalism because it has been the greatest engine of, it’s been the greatest anti-poverty program and engine of progress that we’ve seen. But The New York Times is very concerned with fairness. We’ve been concerned with the essential equality of human beings from the get-go, and with minority rights and individual rights from the get-go. And in thinking about, for example, the tax bill in this and that, you know, we actually like the idea of reducing corporate rates. We’re not for taxation for purposes of taxation, but we are very concerned about fairness and equitable distribution. And it’s sort of wrestling with the, with the tensions there is, I think, how we come out where we do. But, you know, there’s a hierarchy of specific concerns. Honesty speaks to, again, to my mind, it speaks to the free exercise of a sound conscience and our preoccupation with First Amendment rights, and the ability for people to always be able to speak their minds and advocate positions that they believe in. That’s kind of at the top of our hierarchy of concerns. NYT employee: Just reading off the Slack channel, I’m going to abstract it out a little, but when you have differing opinions, how do you first of all vet and make sure that facts are right? But maybe even going a step further, how do you make sure that people aren’t misrepresenting facts? Maybe if you could even tie that into how you even think about the voices you invite in, to kind of judge whether they’re really going to take a fair take on [inaudible]. Bennet: You know we do, I mean at a very basic level, we fact-check our work. So, there is a kind of layer there of having a — but the harder question is representation of fact. And that’s where we’re really, you know, are instilling rules of the road and kind of values for how we approach argumentation and hiring for people. And you know, the first-order value is intellectual honesty. And that means — and God knows we don’t succeed at this every day — but the goal is, you’re supposed to take on the hard arguments on the other side, not the easy arguments. Not the straw men, but the actual substantive, kind of toughest arguments and acknowledge when the other side has a point. No ad hominem attacks. There’s a sort of series of things that we expect of our people and we’re hiring, to my mind — the two columnists who have been brought on board since I’ve been here have been Bret and Michelle so far, and both of them totally clear the bar, in my view, of being people who have both conviction — strong points of view — and very open minds. I give our conservatives, in general, particular credit because they have to live this every day in a way liberals don’t, because they’re working in an environment where they are constantly having to grapple [with] people with very, very different points of view. It really is in the hiring, of picking people that have these different [inaudible]. But the seduction of straw-man arguing is quite powerful and something. And it’s a danger on the editorial side, too, that we face a lot. Particularly when you’re operating within an echo chamber. NYT employee: So, kind of building on that, there’s sort of a question related, which is, like, in a world where a lot of people are sort of interested [in] reading the thing that they agree with, how do you balance the desire to have opposing viewpoints versus, you know, people gravitating to certain kinds of coverage? So yeah, just, how do you think about that? Bennet: I’m really concerned about this for opinion journalism generally, because right now in the last couple of years, with your — particularly now, though, the rewards for saying the same thing over and over again, and providing that kind of affirmation, are huge. And the punishments for stepping out of line and saying something — I’m talking about the individual writer, now — saying, hey, actually you know, the Democrats have a point about X or the Republicans have a point about Y, depending on their point of view, you just get killed for that in social media.  Then the effect of this, and I think you can see it happening, is that writers are becoming less interesting. You know, I can say this particularly as someone who is looking forward to new opinion writers. And you want supple minds and people who are a little bit unpredictable, and you’re not reading the same piece over and over again. It’s getting harder to find people like that. And it is partly a function of the media environment. We need super-strong, tough people, for one thing, to weather that environment and stay true to the ambitions that we have for the work we want done. NYT employee: I’m going to read, specifically, just cause I want your reaction to it, which is, how do you have a civil debate when one side isn’t interested in being civil or factual? Bennet: I think there are a lot of people out there, on both sides actually, who aren’t that interested in — and I’ll be accused of both-siderism, I’m only saying that because I’ve experienced it — who aren’t particularly interested in being civil or factual. And that’s true. And I actually understand that feeling myself some days, when I don’t feel like I want to be terribly civil or factual because I’m so angry about it. Um, read the question again, it was —  NYT employee: Let me ask it this way. [inaudible] How do you think about, like, is there one side that isn’t — this specific thing is, one side isn’t interested in being civil or factual, and how do you think about that? Or not. Bennet: I think that that’s true, and I lament it. I just don’t want to give into that ourselves. And I also think there are a lot of people out there who are susceptible to feeling that way, who aren’t necessarily going to feel that way if they are presented with an alternative. And this is where I think if — it’s not like we’re going to win all those people over and bring them onto our platform necessarily. But I do think if we show that we take — let’s talk about it from the point of view of the left and think about conservatives. Most of our readers [inaudible] are liberal. I think if we show we take conservatives seriously and we take ideas seriously there, we get a lot more moderates paying attention to what The New York Times has to say. I think we lose the moderates completely if we just show that we think the conservatives are just, that there’s no point in even engaging their ideas or to debate with them. That’s not the same thing as saying, you know, I don’t think we’re going to reform everybody in the world.  NYT employee: It’s a follow-up to something kind of earlier. You identified that you’re having trouble finding new voices, and that a lot of the problems you’ve identified seem to be that we just don’t have people representing certain positions. During the election you had no strong advocate for [Sen.] Bernie Sanders [I-Vt.], or any of those positions. And so I guess, in the more recent months, in your attempts to find those voices, where have you been looking, what types of people have you been looking for, and how are you trying to get a more diverse group of people regularly writing in the op-ed section? Bennet: I think we need, and you know, I’m sorry if I’m going to talk in code a little bit here, but I’m not talking about ideology necessarily. I’m talking about identity, as well. What columnists do, you know,p again, highly intellectually honest, highly entertaining, highly interesting writers who have a lot to say — hard to find those people from the get-go. What a columnist is is a trusted voice in your ear that helps you process, kind of, the world in real time, right? Through a particular lens. And there are a number of lenses we’re missing right now, I think. And a lot of those are, it’s gender and it’s identity, you know, as well as ideology. So where am I looking? I’m asking, I’m asking you guys. You know, send me names, please. You know, if there are people that you’re reading that you think belong in The New York Times. You know, please. I always, when I was at The Atlantic, I always kept a list of Atlantic writers who didn’t work for The Atlantic, just who felt like — I was at The Atlantic magazine before I came back to the Times, and there was a particular kind of, not that dissimilar from the kind of people we’re looking for now, with voice. And I could see them on other platforms and they just didn’t know that they were Atlantic people yet, but they were. And I don’t have as good a list now as I did then. It might be my own failing. Earlier I blamed the environment for that. But I’m taking nominations.   I’ve been... if I could, this is what I would be spending 90 percent of my time on. Because hiring in general, and I’m sure you guys feel this, too, is the most important thing that we do. Like, that’s the most important editing we do, is picking the people. After that, you know, you ideally cut them loose to do their thing. In reality, I’m spending a small percentage of my time on this. So I would love help. So please send your nominations my way. NYT employee: So question for you. Do you consider women’s rights, trans rights, people of color’s rights, to be liberal stances? Bennet: Um, I consider them to be classically liberal stances, as I understand liberalism classically. Which is to say, very concerned with the rights of the individual. The sort of John Stuart Mill sense of the world. You know, in a sort of American modern ideological framework, I would say they are also understood to be liberal. But I guess that’s not necessarily the way I would — I mean, these are human rights and deeply connected, I think, to our understanding of human value, which, again, I think is core to the editorial convictions of The New York Times. The essential equality of human beings. NYT employee: Maybe, can I just do a follow-up on that one? How would you think about, like, when you think about encouraging open debate, something like trans rights versus climate change where, you know — are there certain things where you said, like, there’s really not a debate? Bennet: Oh yeah, there are certain things I would think of as settled law. And I think the fact of climate change is one of them. That is the science of climate change, that it’s happening and that humans are driving it. What to do about it, how to address it, I think that’s a big debate that, in general, we should be participating in more actively than we are, right? Yeah, there are issues like, “Nazism: good or bad?” is not a debate I imagine The New York Times necessarily convening. It’s just, like, I think there are issues that are settled law. Although, apparently now slavery is an issue again in the Alabama Senate race, as of today. There’s people making a case for that. Well, [Roy] Moore was asked — I only saw it — I guess he was asked when the last time America was great was, and that was when it was great.  NYT employee: So just to follow up on this, there was a thread in Slack on this. You know, with climate change, can people have opinions about it? You know, like with trans rights, can people have opinions about it? Or is The New York Times’ perspective, “No no no, the debate that we want to encourage is not whether there should be trans rights or whether there is climate change but the implications for society about it.” Or how do you think about it? Bennet: I think we should have discussions about what the implications are for society. I’m not sure I understand the question exactly. NYT employee: The question is — we’re talking about the debate, what matters are settled that shouldn’t even be debated, versus what the debate actually is. I think, you know, climate change is a good example. So they said that you have a voice in the opinion pages who maybe has a different perspective about what to do with climate change. You’d say, “It’s not that Bret Stephens opposes or doesn’t think climate change is happening,” right? Or is he representing that other perspective? How do you think about where the debate begins versus the debate having been settled? Bennet: We — let me answer this generically first, and then come back specifically to Bret and climate change. We have, this is, this is the hard and interesting debate we have all the time, which is, what are the boundaries for debate in Times opinion. There are no hard and fast rules here. And it’s our privilege and burden as editors to define those boundaries, and we will get it wrong, right? There will be times we’ll publish a piece that feels, “Wow, that’s really a little bit out of bounds.” I would expect that to happen sometimes. I’d be much [more] worried about the environment in which we never crossed that boundary than one in which every now and then we do. So, that’s going to happen, I think. And that said, we have faced this over and over again. For example, we published a piece — well, I just gave away the punchline — but we had a big argument over a piece by a settler. And you know, pick your issue. For some people it’s climate change, for some people it’s trans rights, for others it’s a two-state solution and the fate of the Palestinians. In this case, it was the settler saying, look, the two-state solution is dead and [it’s] time to face reality, and here’s some alternative paths for what the future would look like. And we had a real debate about whether this piece was crossing a line, because was it denying personhood to the Palestinians? Was it an act of, kind of, hate speech in a sense? I felt strongly that we should publish the piece and we did, as did others. Because this particular viewpoint is hugely consequential. It actually is creating reality on the ground. To pretend that somehow we would be — either to think that we were legitimating that point of view by having it in our pages or to tell ourselves that we were somehow changing the reality by not allowing it into our pages seems to me to be deluded a little bit. And our readers need to hear it, like, unmediated, I think. They need to confront these arguments. And we published that piece, and we faced that.  We talk a lot about the Richard Spencer test, you know: Would we publish Richard Spencer in the pages of The New York Times? The answer to that is no — oh, well, the piece we’d publish from him is “Why I Got Everything Wrong, by Richard Spencer,” if he was owning up to it. I mean, as you could imagine, there’s conditions. But the reasons we wouldn’t right now are largely because the guy is — he represents a particularly poisonous point of view. And that isn’t having those kinds of consequences. You know, it’s not a, it’s not a giant movement. We’ve published [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, you know, and should we not allow Vladimir Putin into our pages? It’s hard to say. It’s hard to say that that would be doing a service to our readers. But as you can see, I mean, I struggle to articulate what those boundaries are. It’s one of the hard things. You guys have to eventually render judgment, you know. And there’s a degree of subjectivity inevitably that creeps into all of these sorts of decisions, and it’s particularly true in the opinion environment. I do — and I mean, it is a real struggle, and I do want to emphasize the thought that I worry a lot more about how, again, over time, you play it safe, you play it safe, you play it safe, and you wind up where, I think, we were. And I think you become a lot less interesting and a lot less of a constructive source of force in this society if you are not willing to take some chances.  NYT employee: So [inaudible] if you publish one thing in this one perspective, how do you think about providing the balance or making sure that when you’re putting something out there — do you think about that? Or ... Bennet: Um, I do. I don’t think we do a great job of that, as much as, you know, we want to have this kind of cacophonous opinion report with a lot of different points of view represented. I think it’s hard to do it and have it be compellingly journalistic. If it’s kind of over-engineered, that is, we’ll only publish this point of view when we have a point of view on the other side. And we’ll present everything as a debate — well, actually there are four or five corners to this debate, and we’ve got to wait until we have all the pieces, and then we — people don’t consume journalism that way, and it doesn’t feel very vital. I think it needs to be a running debate, that we need to be more deliberate over time about representing all these points of view. And then again, it’s a product question, too, like once we have them all, we need to be able to present them as a kind of constellation. But even in the editorial piece of it, and this is part of what the reorganization of our team is about, we’re not doing — we’re getting better at that. And look, you guys, I mean, debates are — there are always many, many points of view. And you can’t — my view is that it’s just one side and the other side, but... more voices is going to help us with that. NYT employee: Do we have time for one more question? [inaudible] Bennet: What do you guys think we’re doing wrong? Or what would you change?  NYT employee: I think something that the staff would probably say is that, on the web, it can be difficult — and this is something that A.G. said when we did the Q&A with him — is that, on the web, it can be difficult to differentiate opinion pieces versus news pieces when they’re, like, right next to each other. That just generally, I think, continues to be a confusing point for a lot of people. Bennet: Yeah, yeah, I agree. We’re trying to make a bunch of changes, improve the labeling. We’re actually going to change — I mean these are, some of these are the sorts of cues we’ve used in the past that we tell ourselves matter but don’t really matter to the readers. I think we are going to wind up with a bolder kind of differentiated typographical treatment for our opinion pieces. But there are some basic things we should be doing, like when it’s an opinion piece, the bio of the writer should be at the top of the piece, so you know kind of some sense of who this is and what point of view they’re advocating. You know, that this is the president of Russia. You know, right now it can look like just a New York Times staff writer, and there are design and product solutions here that I hope we’re going to have in place in the first quarter next year. But honestly, I thought we’d have them in the first quarter of this year, so I can’t — um, things take a long time to work their way through the processes here. But I do agree. I worry about that a lot. I know I really don’t like our opinion work to be contaminated by the news side.",we,been,that

"BlackBerry marked the end of an era Tuesday by announcing it would discontinue its Classic smartphone. The news marks another chapter in the Ontario-based company's ongoing shift toward making software and services, rather than mobile handsets, a core part of the business. In a Tuesday blog post, BlackBerry COO and General Manager for Devices Ralph Pini acknowledged that ""sometimes it can be very tough to let go.""  ""The Classic has long surpassed the average lifespan for a smartphone in today’s market,” Pini said. “We are ready for change so we can give our customers something better.” BlackBerry devices like the Classic have long been the smartphone of choice for business executives and world leaders for their security and full keyboard. The Classic, just one of three remaining phones in BlackBerry's stable that has a full QWERTY keyboard, was released in 2014 with high expectations.  As the smartphone landscape became dominated by touchscreen-only devices, the Classic was aimed at snapping up traditional keyboard fans.  Before the market domination by the touchscreen-only Android and iPhone, BlackBerry phones stood out with their proprietary instant messaging application and full QWERTY keyboard; flip phone and bar phone users at the time were left sending clunky text messages with T9 typing.  Yet even amid the high expectations for the Classic, BlackBerry's prospects as a phone manufacturer were already in trouble. At its peak in 2011, the company shipped 52.3 million devices, according to Reuters; Apple, meanwhile, sold 72 million iPhones that same year.  Six months after the launch of the Classic, BlackBerry's overall market share of mobile phones was just 0.3 percent, according to market research analyst IDC. ""If they’re going to base their turnaround on anything, it’s probably not going to be on devices,” said Will Stofega, an analyst with IDC.  BlackBerry's signature security features were part of its undoing and ultimately undermined their device sales, according to Andrew McDonnell, vice president of security for the information technology and security firm AsTech Consulting. Secure information on BlackBerrys could be accessed with an encryption key, McDonnell explained. ""That means once the key is out in the wild, it could be used over and over again for anyone who has it. And the key can’t be redesigned."" McDonnell said that kind of built-in ""permanent back door"" caused concern among users, particularly given situations like the FBI's recent attempts to compel Apple to break into the iPhones belonging to the San Bernadino shooters.  Around 2010, governments in countries like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Russia wanted the ability to monitor BlackBerry data in their countries, purportedly for national security purposes. To gain a foothold in foreign markets that had banned their products, BlackBerry (then known as Research In Motion) ultimately acquiesced and gave encryption keys to several foreign governments.  ""The fact there was essentially a back door, from a security perspective, was doomed to be unusable in the long term,” McDonnell said. ""BlackBerry could help governments or anyone else eavesdrop."" And while security was a selling point to users who traded in sensitive information, it's practically a non-issue to average smartphone users who would rather have access to the latest apps than encryption service, Stofega said.  ""The average [smartphone] user tends to think security is putting a passcode on their screen lock,"" Stofega said. “People don’t really think about it until the worst thing happens."" Meanwhile, BlackBerry's shrinking market share offered little incentive for developers to make new apps -- or even adapt popular ones like Snapchat -- to the BlackBerry platform.  ""Developers are swayed by markets. They want the biggest exposure for their applications,"" Stofega said. These days, he added, Android and iOS are the biggest games in town by a wide margin. ""If BlackBerry is going to make a comeback, it’s going to be on software and services and the ability to leverage some of the stuff they had from the old days."" ",McDonnell,said,term
"From Mother Nature Network's Laura Moss: A new study reveals that climate change might not threaten pikas as much as scientists once thought.

Past research has shown that rising temperatures drive the animals to higher elevations or wipe them out completely, but University of Utah biologists discovered that roly-poly pikas in one area have found a unique way to adapt.

The pikas living in rockslides near sea level in Oregon survive hot temperatures by eating more moss than any other mammal.
""To our knowledge, this study represents the highest degree of voluntary moss consumption reported for a mammalian herbivore in the wild,"" states the paper, which appears in the February 2014 issue of Journal of Mammalogy. Pikas are very sensitive to heat, and the tiny critters can die if they spend more than two hours above 78 degrees Fahrenheit.

""They basically are shaped like spheres, which is optimal for conserving heat,"" said biology doctoral student Jo Varner in a news release. ""They have a thick fur coat and a high metabolic rate, which means they generate a lot of heat. The thick fur coat traps it, and so does their spherical shape.""

Researchers observed 220 hours of pika behavior and were surprised to find that the animals were eating so much moss.

""By consuming mosses that grow on the rockslides where they live, the pikas are released from foraging outside the safety and shady heat buffer of the rocks,"" said Varner. By staying so close to home, the creatures are less likely to overheat or to fall victim to predators. ""Few herbivores consume moss because it's so nutritionally deficient. The pikas in our study actually set a new record for moss in a mammal's diet: 60 percent.""

""Some fiber is good, but this is almost all fiber,"" said Denise Dearing, senior author of the study. ""Mosses are 80 percent fiber. It's a bit like eating paper.""

Researchers also found that pikas in this population build smaller food caches to survive the winter than pikas that live at higher elevations. Living at a lower elevation with warmer temperatures gives the animals access to what the biologists describe as a ""year-round salad bar.""",pikas,set,diet
"In what’s been characterized as the most progressive remarks ever uttered by a modern pontiff about homosexuality, Pope Francis reportedly told a gay man during a recent conversation at the Vatican that “God made you like that and he loves you like that.” Juan Carlos Cruz, a survivor of clerical sexual abuse, said Francis made the comments to him when they met for a private discussion last month to discuss the sex abuse and cover-up scandal involving Catholic priests in Cruz’s native Chile. “He told me, ‘Juan Carlos, the fact that you’re gay doesn’t matter. God made you like that, and he loves you like that, and I don’t care,’” Cruz told Spanish newspaper El Pais, recalling his two-and-half-hour conversation with the pontiff.  Cruz, who was abused as a child by the Rev. Fernando Karadima, Chile’s most notorious pedophile priest, told the paper that his sexual orientation came up during the discussion because he has been targeted for being gay after speaking out about his abuse. “They had told [Francis] that I was practically a pervert. I explained that I’m not the reincarnation of San Luis Gonzaga, but I am not a bad person, I try to not harm anyone,” Cruz told El Pais. Francis responded, Cruz said, by telling him, “The pope loves you [as you are], you have to be happy with who you are.” I spoke for more than two and a half hours alone with Pope Francis. He listened to me with great respect, affection and closeness, like a father. We talked about many subjects. Today I have more hope in the future of our church... Even though the task is enormous. A representative at the Vatican declined to confirm or deny the pontiff’s remarks, telling The Los Angeles Times, “We don’t normally comment on the pope’s private conversations.” Francis has spoken with compassion about homosexuality, though his comments have not led to any real change in the church’s longstanding position on homosexuality.  “If someone is gay and is searching for the Lord and has good will, then who am I to judge him?” Francis famously said in 2013. Later that year, he suggested in an interview that God does not “reject and condemn” gay people.  The LA Times described Francis’ reported comments to Cruz as expressing a possibly “new level of acceptance of homosexuality” for the Catholic Church. “This is a big deal, I cannot remember the pope making a comment about gay people being born that way,” the Rev. James Martin, an American priest who has advocated for bridging the divide between the church and the LGBTQ community, told the Times this week. “Pope Francis has repeated what all reputable biologists and psychologists say — you don’t choose your sexual orientation. And that is a great comfort to many gay and lesbian Catholics who have been told by priests that they have chosen their orientation and are therefore guilty,” Martin continued. Observers have warned against hyping the pontiff’s comments, however, as they were uttered in private and don’t represent a shift in church teaching. The Catholic Church’s catechism, which summarizes the church’s doctrinal positions, states that homosexuality’s “psychological genesis remains largely unexplained.” Homosexual acts are described as depraved and “contrary to natural law.” “Under no circumstances can they be approved,” the catechism reads. Still, experts said Francis’ reported comments suggested that church attitudes toward the LGBTQ community are shifting. “It goes beyond ‘who am I to judge?’ to ‘you are loved by God,’” Christopher Lamb, the Vatican correspondent for the Catholic newspaper Tablet, told The Guardian. “I don’t think he has changed church teaching but he’s demonstrating an affirmation of gay Catholics, something that has been missing over the years in Rome.” Additional reporting by HuffPost reporter Carol Kuruvilla.",Cruz,explained,Pais
"The U.S. Department of Agriculture is pushing forward with a proposed rule that would forego line-speed limits in hog processing plants, a move that could endanger the well-being of workers and consumers, activists say. The proposal is part of the USDA’s effort to “modernize” the swine industry, the organization announced earlier this month. These plants, which already work at feverish speeds of up to 1,106 hogs per hour, would likely use the change as an opportunity to further increase the pace of production.  In addition to increasing line speeds, the proposal would allow employees to take over some of the oversight duties that USDA inspectors currently handle on the kill lines. The way it works now, USDA inspectors are expected to examine every animal that comes down the line, and are tasked with identifying diseased hogs and visible fecal matter. Under the proposed rule, plant employees would take over that job before the carcasses reach federal inspectors. The move could potentially help the hog industry’s bottom line. But faster speeds could also put consumers at risk, since inspectors may not be able to examine each carcass adequately for diseases and other issues. Increasing the rate of speed lines could present more risks for plant workers who already face a slew of hazards at the industry’s current pace, including amputations and musculoskeletal injuries, such as carpal tunnel syndrome.  But the USDA maintains that it’s not its responsibility to ensure worker safety ― that’s up to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, said Carmen Rottenberg, deputy administrator at the Food Safety and Inspection Service at USDA. The proposal is “a gift to the industry,” said Tony Corbo, senior lobbyist with Washington-based advocacy group Food & Water Watch. “The industry has been pushing to deregulate inspection all the way back to the Reagan administration.” Corbo added that while the proposed rule fits in with the Trump administration’s “deregulatory talk,” the concept actually precedes the current presidency.  During the Obama administration, the USDA approved a similar plan for poultry plants in 2014. But after getting bombarded with pushback from activists and the media, the government organization decided to prohibit plants from ramping up the speeds on slaughter lines.  Rottenberg told HuffPost that the revised protocol would increase efficiency and free up USDA inspectors to perform other tasks around the hog plants. The organization pointed to the “success” of a pilot program that started in the late 1990s, which allowed five hog plants to operate as their own designated speeds. “For large-volume establishments, this new swine inspection system does make better use of the agency’s resources while also removing unnecessary regulatory obstacles to industry,” said Rottenberg.  But a 2013 report from the Office of the Inspector General harshly criticized the USDA for its lack of oversight of pork slaughterhouses in general, and took issue with the five plants involved in the pilot program in particular. The report concluded that between 2008 and 2011, three of the 10 plants with the most citations for food safety and animal welfare violations were part of the USDA pilot program. Those plants, which had 50 percent more citations than the plant with next highest number, continue to run at the same speeds.  Workers’ advocates also say that faster line speeds will make an already dangerous job even more dangerous. Serious injuries ― those that require work restrictions or days off from work ― are more than three times higher in meat packing than other U.S. industries, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. While protecting workers is not within the USDA’s regulatory purview, activists say that workers at slaughterhouses – who are often refugees and immigrants that are reluctant to speak up about hazardous conditions ― rely on USDA’s rules to keep them safe. “Food safety regulations have acted as a de facto throttle on line speeds, and has consequently protected workers,” said Nicole Civita, a lawyer, professor, food ethicist and director of the Food Recovery Project. Before moving forward with the proposed rule, the USDA will accept comments from the public for 60 days, through mid-March. Earlier this week, the USDA rejected a petition from the National Chicken Council requesting that poultry processing plants be allowed to do away with line speed maximums.  Activists say there’s no difference between the poultry and hog industries: If the USDA rejected the idea of increasing line speed for chickens, they should also reject it for hogs for the same reasons.  “Do people really want to eat meat that has not been properly processed? What if they find toenails in their hot dogs, or if hogs were diseased and haven’t been caught because the lines are moving so fast?” Corbo said. “Operating at these excessive line speeds without having adequate inspection will put more product into commerce [and] on people’s tables that are unsafe and not wholesome to eat.”",move,help,line
"As lunch was winding down Wednesday in the Los Angeles Times cafeteria, Bruce Upbin, one of several newly hired but as-yet-unannounced assistant managing editors, sat alone at a table speaking a little too loudly into his headphone mic. Upbin was a mystery to much of the newspaper’s staff, which had just voted to unionize the week before. He was one of several similarly unannounced middle-manager types who had come aboard in recent weeks. Although he and the others were listed in the Times’ human resources software as having editorial titles, they were reporting to Rob Angel, the Times’ chief business development officer. These new L.A. managers had also been working on the second floor, despite the newsroom being on the third. And, of course, there was the bizarre fact that they had yet to be introduced to any of the actual newsroom staff of about 400.  One L.A. Times employee, who spoke to HuffPost on the condition of anonymity, overheard Upbin say they were creating a national newsroom outside of the union, to service all of Tronc’s markets. Tronc, formerly Tribune Publishing, is the owner of the L.A. Times, along with other newspapers in 10 markets across the country. Upbin also mentioned that he had a total of five people to hire. This was the closest thing Times employees have gotten in weeks to a real answer about what the company is up to — and it was a confirmation of some of their worst fears.  The new management team is apparently being framed as part of a “reorganization,” according to Harvard’s Nieman Lab. Since being hired in October, L.A. Times Editor-in-Chief Lewis D’Vorkin has quietly brought on a number of editors from around the country. In addition to Upbin, who had worked with D’Vorkin at Forbes, he hired former Fox Sports executive Steve Miller as an assistant managing editor for digital; Louise Story, a renowned former New York Times reporter, as managing editor; The Washington Post’s Sylvester Monroe as an assistant managing editor; and Will Tacy of Good Media as an editor.  Hello @sylvestermonroe @louisestory @bupbin @tacyw ! Those of us in the @LATimes newsroom would love to hear what you all are doing here! With the exception of Miller, none of these new managers has been announced to the public or even to the staff itself. And the only reason anyone knows any of this is thanks to the company’s internal HR software, which has proved to be one of the only windows into management’s thinking. HuffPost spoke with 12 current and former Times employees, all of whom asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution. They described an atmosphere of intense secrecy, distrust and anxiety as they try to get to the bottom of a story they’re living instead of reporting: What exactly does Tronc have in store for them? “The newsroom has basically become a large-scale intelligence operation to figure out what the fuck our managers are up to,” one current employee explained. And though the newsroom did discover bits and pieces, Upbin helped tie the whole thing together. Staffers fear that Tronc is building a shadow national newsroom — non-union, of course — that would duplicate not only parts of the L.A. Times union staff but that of other Tronc properties as well, making the union employees expendable. And, although Tronc and L.A. Times senior management — which includes D’Vorkin, Times President Mickie Rosen and CEO and Publisher Ross Levinsohn, who is currently on a leave of absence following allegations of sexual harassment — have refused to offer any clarity about what this might mean, much less acknowledge the existence of a new national operation, you can only stonewall a roomful of reporters for so long before they start digging on their own. D’Vorkin and the newly hired managers did not initially respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment. On Jan. 29, after this story was first published, Louise Story told HuffPost, “I had agreed to work at Tronc and at The Los Angeles Times in very high-level managerial roles. But, as a result of recent significant changes in those roles, I decided not to work there in any capacity. I’m sorry that I won’t get to join the scores of great journalists who work there.” Part of what makes these new hires’ roles so difficult to pin down for staffers, though, is a curious little trait shared by all of Tronc’s new managerial hires (and at least a few non-managerial ones): They’ve all actually been hired under a different company than the one employing every other editorial employee on staff. Though union L.A. Times staffers are all employed under Los Angeles Times Communications LLC, according to the same internal HR system that revealed the existence of these hires in the first place, these mysterious new employees have been hired under a Tronc company that was renamed Los Angeles Times Network LLC in November, as reported earlier Friday by Nieman Lab’s Ken Doctor. If you look on the California Secretary of State’s website, you’ll find the name change filing below. The new L.A. Times entity first came to the attention of newsroom employees when they saw an “LA Network” referenced in a Tronc job listing.  Employees realized this was likely the “network” mysteriously referenced in a slide from a presentation Levinsohn gave on Jan. 18, the same day sexual harassment allegations against him came out. This presentation was ostensibly about an upcoming network of unpaid contributors, along the lines of the one D’Vorkin implemented at Forbes. According to both a former employee and a current staffer, Levinsohn wasn’t explaining the full picture. In addition to this free contributor network, Tronc is apparently planning to create a series of specialized teams, called verticals, that will exist entirely within this new L.A. Times Network, which is being referred to internally as NewCo and which exists as part of the business side — not editorial, as one would expect from a news operation. Each of the new managers is supposedly presiding over a different vertical, multiple employees told HuffPost. For instance, Monroe will head up a vertical covering race issues, Upbin will be overseeing the tech vertical, and Story, who is in New York, will take on an investigative vertical. The work created under these verticals, both from professional and non-professional contributors, will then be distributed across not only the L.A. Times but also Tronc newspapers nationally. Complicating this is the fact that many of these non-union verticals already exist under the actual L.A. Times editorial operation, which strives to maintain a strict separation from any business interests. (The paper has a history of trampling the line between business and editorial.) Some employees worry this is a precursor to layoffs for the union staffers, whom Tronc seems to be actively making redundant. Another possibility is that Tronc will focus on building up a non-union workforce under NewCo and kill the union through attrition. On Jan. 19, the newsroom voted overwhelmingly to unionize, 248 to 44, with the NewsGuild. Given the turmoil in recent days, the union sent a note to members informing them of their so-called Weingarten right to be accompanied by a union representative in any meeting with management in which discipline seems possible. After workers vote to unionize, a company generally has to keep the status quo in place as the parties bargain toward a contract, meaning that, legally speaking, it would be tough for the company to fire a bunch of newsroom staffers and give their work to new non-union workers. The NewsGuild declined to comment, but the standard union move here would be to demand information from the company on any new hires and where they fit in with the current organization. As one staffer put it, “Our strategy right now as a union is to find out everything we can and to raise our voices without fear of individual repercussions.” Whatever its intentions, management is taking no steps to assuage staffers’ concerns.  At a recent meeting that D’Vorkin held with a group of reporters and editors, one employee asked what Levinsohn’s Jan. 18 presentation meant for Times staffers. D’Vorkin didn’t have an answer, according to a current employee and a former employee. “I didn’t see Ross’s presentation” was all he would allow. Staffers pressed him, explaining that that’s not what they’d asked — they had asked what was going to happen to them. “I didn’t see Ross’s presentation,” he said again.  “The Los Angeles Times is like a Soviet circus right now,” said one current employee. “Propaganda. Dancing bears. Mercurial leaders who say weird shit. People who disappear. It sucks, because we have a good team here.” The company may not have officially explained what this hazy border between the Times and the business side of Tronc actually means, but its effects are already causing trouble for the paper’s increasingly anxious staff.  Last week, Dan Strauss, senior vice president and general manager for entertainment and lifestyle, met with a group of entertainment section editors. Strauss, who works at the Times under the Tronc business side, introduced several of the editors to Christina Schoellkopf, who is listed internally as a senior social media manager and who Strauss said would be running the entertainment social channels on a day-to-day basis. Schoellkopf, however, had been hired under NewCo, meaning she was technically a business employee and reported directly to a business manager.  When an editorial staffer raised an objection to someone from the business side running accounts that were supposed to represent the news outlet, according to an employee, Strauss said simply: “We’re all on the same team. We all work for the L.A. Times.” When the employee noted again that the two sides were supposed to be separate, Strauss said that they would take the conversation “offline” and discuss it later. They did not discuss it later. In an email addressed to D’Vorkin and Miller that eventually got forwarded around the newsroom, Jessica Roy, the audience engagement editor, plainly laid out the reasons for her and her team’s discomfort: Lewis and Steve- I wanted to raise some concerns I had based on my meeting this morning with Dan Strauss and the entertainment editors. Dan informed us that he has hired Christina Schoellkopf as a senior social media manager, and that she would be assuming responsibility for all entertainment editorial social media accounts. I have serious concerns about an employee who was vetted, hired by and reports to the business side of the Los Angeles Times making editorial decisions and assuming publishing control of our brand on social media. Such an arrangement is unprecedented in this newsroom ― and is not the standard practice in most newsrooms. Our audience has an expectation that these accounts are independent from the business side in the same way print readers expect that editors choose the stories on the front page. What we post on social media and how it is framed is an extension of the journalism that we do here at The Times, and it should come from our editorial side. Over the past few years, my team has guided best practices and style across all social media channels, including Entertainment. When we trained the WebEnt producers to do this, we went over things like photo permissions (which photos we legally can and can’t tweet, for instance), the L.A. Times voice on social media, our policy for corrections on social media, and general best practices. Furthermore, journalists in the newsroom adhere to certain guidelines and standards.  We carefully craft social media messages to maintain both the objectivity of our work and the trust of our readership. I am deeply concerned this violates the separation between editorial and business.  At the least, this infringes on the structures that ensure our editorial independence. I wanted to raise this issue with both of you to get your perspectives. -Jessica Roy Co-signed by the entire audience engagement team D’Vorkin replied thanking her and assuring the team that there would be “more discussions to come.” When, exactly, D’Vorkin intends to hold those discussions remains unclear.  The secrecy surrounding both the editorial staff’s future and NewCo hires in general has begun to take its toll on the staff. “They’re creating these supposed management jobs, and they’re not opening any of them to the people currently on staff,” said a current employee. “So no matter how many Pulitzers you’ve won, what your reputation is, [newsroom employees] have not been given the opportunity to apply for any of these jobs. D’Vorkin won’t even answer questions about them.” Though he has so far refused to answer any questions, D’Vorkin has been plenty busy asking them. According to multiple current and former employees, D’Vorkin is still livid about an article that appeared in The New York Times in November. That paper had obtained a recording of a meeting in which D’Vorkin forbade Los Angeles Times staffers from recirculating their own recent investigation into Disney’s business ties with the city of Anaheim. A couple of months later, NPR obtained a recording of a second meeting, in which D’Vorkin berated his staff for the first leak: “At its core, it was unethical. And frankly, I think it showed a degree that whoever was involved was morally bankrupt.” Now, according to several employees, D’Vorkin is determined to find the leaker in his midst, and Tronc is supporting the cause by sending human resources executive Dyana Burke to L.A. to assist the investigation. According to one former employee, “They had to bring her in because there are no HR people left at the L.A. Times.” Cindy Ballard, Tronc’s former chief HR officer, resigned in December. Ballard, in the words of one former employee, was “the architect of the masthead purges” in August, in which the editor-publisher, a managing editor, a deputy managing editor and an assistant managing editor were axed. D’Vorkin is also getting proactive about leaks, multiple staffers worry. They expressed concerns that Tronc was monitoring company phones and computers — and apparently they have reason to be worried. One former staffer noted that “people are being hauled before D’Vorkin and Burke to explain why, for example, they had an 11-minute conversation with Sydney Ember of The New York Times on a particular date.” Staffers have been using encrypted messaging apps, such as WhatsApp, to speak with one another, with some going so far as to buy actual burner phones to discuss their own newspaper.  “It strains belief that the editor-in-chief of a major newspaper, with all the other issues and challenges confronting the LAT, is conducting a leak investigation of his own staff,” a former employee told HuffPost. “That’s the kind of thing the FBI and NSA do to persecute journalists. To see an editor do it is dumbfounding, and sickening.” Multiple staffers said that this investigation is what led to business editor Kimi Yoshino’s removal from the building on Wednesday. Management hasn’t explained why Yoshino was escorted off the premises and suspended for two days. But a former employee and a current employee both pointed to the Disney story that caused D’Vorkin so much grief, which Yoshino edited. The staff of the Business section just sent the following letter to @latimes Editor in Chief Lewis D’Vorkin. I want to add that @kyoshino is the best boss I’ve ever had - smart, kind, compassionate and fair. Hope she’s back in the newsroom soon. pic.twitter.com/F8UcuUe9UN That Yoshino edited the Disney investigation is particularly significant considering that multiple current and former employees commented on D’Vorkin’s particularly rough treatment of Yoshino, with one describing his behavior toward her as “harshly critical” and “caustic.” Yoshino declined to comment.  A recent profile of D’Vorkin in the Columbia Journalism Review, titled “LA Journalism’s ‘Prince of Darkness,’” noted that “even those who speak positively about him acknowledge he can be difficult, threatening, and, in the words of one writer who worked with D’Vorkin for more than four years and actually likes him, ‘without journalistic ethic.’” Though D’Vorkin has been in his position for only a few months, he’s made sure to leave a mark, with one employee noting that “he’s at war with the entire staff. It’s incredible.” Still, though the current editorial staff has fluctuated somewhere between misery and terror, the recent landslide union victory has offered some consolation. “People have zero confidence in top management,” said one current employee. “Nobody believes a word that comes out of Lewis’ mouth. They’re pushing a business plan from 10 years ago. And yet people are banding together, and we are still doing what we’ve done since 1881, which is putting out the goddamn paper every day.”  UPDATE: Jan. 27 — The Los Angeles Times Guild organizing committee has released a statement demanding that Tronc’s management team explain its plans for their future and reminding Tronc of the Guild’s rights as employees, saying, “As journalists, we demand transparency from the people we cover. As employees of the Los Angeles Times, we demand the same of the executives who run our company.” You can read the Guild’s statement in full here.  This story has been updated to include comment from Louise Story. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article said that executive Dan Strauss met with the newspaper’s audience engagement team. He met with a group of Times entertainment editors.

"I recently had the privilege of talking story with Lukela from Ekolu and Micah G while they were on their ""Strictly for the Lovers"" Tour. Once again, my good friends over at Da 808 Music Entertainment, came through with another great island reggae show for our region.   I had been listening to Ekolu for a little over a decade now and it was truly awesome to hear the stories behind the band, their music, and the love they have for their family and fans!  Micah G is an up and coming artist from Honolulu yet he's not stranger to the music industry with a strong lineage to beginnings of Hawaiian reggae music. Both Lukela and Micah were rich in passion and although they've proven their status as mainstays in the island reggae scene, remain humble and thankful for the gifts and blessings they've received thus far. Hang out for awhile then download their music on iTunes (Ekolu : Micah G).  You won't be sorry! All Photos Credit to:  Brad Puet  Brad Puet: Aloha ya'll!  Welcome Lukela from Ekolu and Micah G!  Currently on tour through the mainland coming from Maui and Oahu!  Guys if you would, please introduce yourselves to the readers of Huffington Post!

Lukela: My name is Lukela. I'm from Ekolu and from the island of Maui.  I'm Hawaiian.  I mean with that I am Hawaiian, Tahitian, and Chinese.

Micah: I'm Micah G and I'm from Honolulu.  I'm Hawaiian, Chinese, and Portuguese.  I'm thankful to Ekolu for the opportunity to go on tour.

L:  It's crazy, I love Micah's music.  We hang out and play music all night and so we thought let's go on tour. So here we are, Strictly for the Lovers!

BP: So let's start with Ekolu, what does it mean?

L: Ekolu means ""3"" in Hawaiian.  Currently we do have eight in the band.  When we first started Ekolu back in high school, there was only the three of us.  We played mostly acoustic Hawaiian music. The name stuck with us throughout the years.

BP: So that was like 1994-1995, so in some aspects you can consider yourselves ""pioneers"" right?

L: Well I don't know about that.  I'll let you say that but I don't know if I can say that for us.

M: I can consider them that kine. They are pioneers for me.

BP: I'm sure you have stories of your journey of being in the music scene and industry for the years you've been a part. Can you tell us about the starting times of Ekolu up through now?

L: So yea, the band started off in high school.  We entered the 1995 ""Brown Bags"" and lost to ballerina dancers.  Pretty much from there we kept close with everybody we met along the way. Me, Makapu, and Akoni (who is no longer in the band) kept practicing as a trio band, again why we call ourselves Ekolu. From there we added keyboards, then drums, and now we have horns. Then we added another guitar player.  It's weird to talk about this now because what is like 20 years ago now?!? That's crazy. Professionally we've been together for 16 years. That was when we put out our first album in 1999.  That album had ""Down in the Valley"" and ""Stuck On You"" and all that stuff.

BP: Can you tell us how it felt when you guys started seeing success in your music?

L: Honestly it just felt like normal.  It's just how we are. We're really laid back. Like ""Ok cool our song is playing on the radio"" ""Ok cool we're playing here"" but that was back then.  Nowadays I'm much more appreciative and thankful. Like back then, we were young.  We didn't know the impact.  But now, for me, I feel like all the new artists, I see them working so hard for what we have.  It makes me appreciate that I have ""that.""

BP: So to keep pushing your music out, what keeps you motivated and inspired?

L: My wife, Dar, is the backbone of everything for me. I don't know if people know, but like before, I was like 541 lbs. So she helped me and supported me and I lost a lot of weight.  She was there for the hard times. I stay motivated and inspired because of her.  My songs are about her.

BP: So who writes the songs for Ekolu?

L:  I pretty much write all the songs. Usually on all the albums, Makapu writes one, Akoni writes one and then I handle the rest pretty much. Again for me, most of the songs are inspired by my wife.  Also these songs are influenced from God, living in Maui, and all that stuff.  The message of our music is pretty much love.  All of that God, Maui, my wife - all of that for me is love.  I think I can say the same for the other band members also.  They have their own inspirations but in my contributions it's God, Maui, and my wife. It's all about love.  Love for our land, love for God, and love for my wife. To my wife: I appreciate you.  I more than appreciate you.  You already know I love you.  You do so much for this band. Thank you.

BP: How have you seen the direction of island/ poly music change since you guys started 20 years ago?

M:  A lot of bands come and go.

L: The whole idea of selling CDs have dwindled.  Like before you could sell 5000 CDs in a month and now everyone waits for YouTube and then grab it off there.  Like this new time, has its good and has its bad.  Like iTunes is good yea.  You record and put it straight onto iTunes.  Before you do the studio then you got to find a distributor and go through all that hassle.  Now you can reach your audience much faster. Of course the bad with the technology is that people can just steal it off YouTube or download it somewhere. So for us artists, we gotta find a way to still be with our fans.  Before we use to sell albums like crazy you know.  Now we keep doing the work by things like gigging.  Doing gigs helps with things financially and connecting to the fans. Ekolu has been it so long, we have a pretty good track record. The people who are going to show up tonight they want to hear our older stuff.  Even if we have new stuff, we know they want to hear stuff like ""Stuck On You"" or ""Down In The Valley"" or ""Shores of Waiehu."" They want to hear the classics. It feels good.  I'm grateful for our fans.

BP: What are your musical influences?

L: I started listening to Hawaiian music. So it was bands like Makaha Sons, Kapena, and for reggae - ASWAD.  Along with that of course comes Steel Pulse and even the newer ones like Morgan Heritage.

BP: Describe for us the sound of island music.

L: Island music is easier to take in.  It's more ""feel good."" It just feels good simple.  That's probably due to our culture in the islands.  We laid back and just want to feel good.

BP:How do you see yourself and Ekolu in five years?

L:  I see myself making an album of just Hawaiian music.  I kinda went backwards.  I started out doing Hawaiian music but never put out an album.  Ekolu has a total of eight albums out.  Before I do another album with Ekolu I think I'm going to try to put out a Hawaiian album. All my aunties, all my uncles they're all getting old.  What I grew up on is their music, their Hawaiian music.  They want me to do an album that is just Hawaiian music.

BP: So explain to us what is traditional Hawaiian music.

L:  Hawaiian music is in Hawaiian language.  It speaks about our land. It speaks about love.

BP:So what is your favorite moment of being in Ekolu?

L:  The first memory that comes up for me is doing a show in Japan.  Being in a foreign land and having folks who don't speak English but singing my songs with me and the band is my favorite moment.  It's crazy to think that even though we probably can't communicate well outside of song, that through music we connect.  Our music back then was banging and the way it is now its even more so.  Oahu music scene is so good and there are so many more good things to come out of the islands but Oahu especially.

BP:  That's a great segue to Micah as he's from the island of Oahu. Honolulu to be exact. Micah, how'd you start in music?

M: I started from a young age.  My first time in the studio recording something professional was when I was about 15-16 years old.  My brother - Calub, cousin, and I came out with an album under Next Generation.  They are now a part of The Green. Calub was our lead singer and at that time he was just 13.  We've been doing this kinda long time. We started real young.

BP: So when ya'll started who helped ya'll understand what you were getting into?

M: My uncle was one of the founders of the band, Mana' o Company. He was a huge influence in what we did then and do today. Kapena and Ekolu were also a huge influence in pursuing our music careers too. I know that they are very influential in me wanting to pursue my passion in music. Right now I'm solo.  I was in the band Next Generation. I decided to go my own way because I wanted to try my own things you know. Outside of island music, I'm very influenced by Luthor Vandross, Stevie Wonder.  Those kine music yea. I play lovers rock reggae. Lovers Rock is a lot more pop-py type reggae music.  Its usually love driven, a lot of love songs.  Ekolu is a huge lovers rock band.  Some of the mainstream lovers rock bands are Beres Hammond, ASWAD.

BP:  What is your inspiration behind writing your music?

M:  I try to be as original as I can.  A lot of my songs are about how I feel.  Things I'm going through.  It's based on some of the things that are going on in my life.  That's what influences my songs and my music.  Hawaiian reggae has that island style to it.  It's easier on the ears and a lot more pop-py like I said.  Hawaii of course is a big inspiration.

BP: How do you see your music?  Ekolu's music?

M:  I love reggae music.  I believe that some bands are either more island than reggae or more reggae than island.  I feel Ekolu is a good balance of both and its what inspires me to be more balanced. I don't want to be more than the other.  Lukela, what do you think?

L: So in 2004, we did an album that was titled, ""Ekolu Music.""  We called it that because we didn't feel that our music was just reggae or it was just island. Our music is Ekolu music.

M:  I definitely agree with that.  It's Ekolu music.

L:  In fact, long story short, our fourth album was supposed to be called, ""Reggae, Reggae Music."" Well this guy at our label told us that our music is not reggae music.  Your music is its own music.  Your music is Ekolu music. So since then, that's how we came up with Ekolu music.  It's our music. Its spread yea.  I hear our music, I hear Hawaiian music spread past just our islands.  I hear it in Japan.  I hear it Guam.  You can just tell in the subtle licks where the sound is from or been influenced by Hawaiian music.

BP:  Why do you think there is such a rich, soulful music coming out of Hawaii?

L & M: It's cultural.

L: For us, we were brought up in it.  Micah's uncle is from Mana' o Company, my uncles are from the 1960's.  There was Hawaiian traditional music around us all the time.  We just grow up with it and it continues on too.  My nephews are learning and playing the music now.

M: I think music is part of any culture.  It's a part of Hawaiian culture HUGE.  It's stronger I feel like.  It's really hard to tell you ""what"" it is.  I can try to explain it to you how it keeps perpetuating itself.  You see me and Lukela is really close.  Our families are really close. For instance, when they are in Honolulu, they come over to my family, to our house.  It doesn't need to be a party but of course it can be.  There is a formula to it.  You ask yourself, ""Where you gon eat? What you gon play?"" You have to have good food and good music to any family house or party you go to.  Otherwise if you don't have both and you're missing one, you're party goes down. It's not just our house or our family, it's all houses and all families in Hawaii.  This is the formula.

BP: My last question for you guys is this:  How do you see God play out in island music and specifically in your music?

L:  For me its so crazy. One of our managers from before, they didn't want us to put church songs in our albums. So before I did Ekolu, I had another album called ""Valley Boys."" On that album I started putting the last song as a church song.  From there on out on every Ekolu album, the last song is a church song. It's my way, our way of giving back you know. It's my ""thank you"" to God and honoring Him. I have so much people from prison coming to me and telling me that the last song helps them.  It's that type of giving back.  I'm thankful to God for blessing me. It's my way of saying thank you for giving me this gift.  It's a crazy gift.

M:  God is a huge part in my life.  My grandma is a pastor.  My wife and I live according to what is right according to Him.  I'm blessed by Him and never want to take it for granted and living out this gift. Follow Ekolu:  Ekolu Live Website : Facebook : Twitter  Follow Micah G: Twitter : Instagram",sound,tell,music
"Art is often a solitary pursuit but, sometimes, even the most reclusive artists must seek out the help and services of others. Artists who make graphic prints or sculpture editions usually look to print studios or foundries to provide the expensive equipment and technical know-how. They are brought together by the desire to create works of art, but this is also a business relationship that needs to be negotiated carefully. The decision on which foundry or print studio to use is complicated by issues of location, price, the right fit of services and the media available. No less important is the quality of the work, turnaround time and a foundry's or studio's ability to keep promises made to artists, and this can be ascertained by asking others who have worked with them in the past. Both fine art foundries and studios have one or more people on staff whose job is to work directly with artists, communicating their direction and changes to staff; these people should be accessible, helpful, organized and enthusiastic. This relationship is likely to make the difference between a positive and negative experience. Print Studios.
The relationship with a print studio begins with a conversation, concerning what the artist wants to do and the various services that the studio can offer to turn a concept into an edition. The physical size of the print, the size (including proofs) and subject matter of the edition, the manner of printing, the length of time allotted to produce the edition, the number of proofs that the printer keeps, the number of colors and the type of paper to be used are the basis of the estimate that the studio provides. However, revisions, additions and alterations during the process are likely to increase the fees. Assuming some level of revisions, the written estimate will usually note some leeway of 10 percent, above which the studio will ask for approval from the artist. Fees may be based on an hourly rate or for the entire project, with payment made at the end, usually within 30 days of completion, although payments also may be scheduled. (Print studios working with an artist for the first time usually request the individual to submit a credit application and provide half of the estimated cost upfront with the rest payable at completion; subsequent jobs with that artist will be completely at the end.) Rush orders and requests to work overtime or on weekends will increase fees by as much as double, and mistakes (the artist didn't catch an error on a proof) or delays attributable to the artist are not the responsibility of the print studio. It is not uncommon for studios to tack on interest charges -- for instance, one-and-a-half percent per month or an annualized 18 percent -- for late payments. Things happen. The artist may not like the work that the studio staff is doing, or there may be a reason that the entire project has to be cancelled. Rejection or cancellation prior to the completion of an edition usually entails a kill fee of 50 percent; if the edition is completed, the artist will be expected to pay the full agreed-upon amount. Any agreement with the print studio should indicate that the artist is the creator of the edition (and owns all copyrights) and retains artistic control, who owns the printing plates (it should be the artist after full payment has been made), whether or not the plates are to be cancelled (that is, defaced, for which the artist should receive a cancellation proof), and that the printer only has been given a one-time right to produce an edition. Tiki Studios in Big Pine, California, stipulates in its contract that it ""always reserves the right to reproduce or use any work created by us for the Client in any reasonable way for our own marketing and self-promotional needs."" Many print studios include a similar clause. As copyright owner, the artist would want to include that his or her artwork cannot be used for promotional purposes without express authorization or payment. Foundries.
Ideas that start as an inspiration often end with a dollars and cents reckoning. The cost of producing a single object or an edition is determined based in part on what the foundry is asked to do -- make molds, build a supporting structure, cast the piece, patinate, create a base, install the finished work, transport and store the molds and completed artwork, insure the molds, complete work by a certain date, contract outside engineers and other sources of expertise -- but the first thing that sculptors should ask for is a quote. Probably included in that estimate is the cost range of a change order, because alterations in the design or fabrication are made during the process. Since material and labor costs fluctuate, the quote should have a lifespan of 90 days.  A payment schedule should be established as well. Typically, this would be in two or three stages, such as 50 percent initial deposit with the remainder paid at completion or 30 percent down payment with another 30 percent at some midpoint approval stage and the rest paid at the completion. Other agreements may spread out payments evenly over a period of months. Whatever the deal, the plan needs to be agreed-upon and work for both artist and foundry. Distance may limit the ability of sculptors to take an active part in the fabrication of their artwork, but artists generally need to approve the wax for investment (making sure there are no air holes and that seams are repaired and concealed, for instance), as well as the metal prior to patination and the patina. The work is all about creating a work of art, but some foundries are reluctant to have the sculptor around a lot, adding a ""shop"" charge to the overall bill. Artists should know in advance the degree to which a foundry welcomes their presence. At times, the molds become a source of contention, because artists complete their editions over a period of years, requiring the foundry to store (taking up considerable space) and insure (determining their value is difficult and they do deteriorate over time) them during the interim. The question of who owns the molds should be established at the outset (the artist, who must pay for them), as well as the issue of who is responsible for keeping them (storage and insurance charges may be part of the final bill). It is a lot to ask that a foundry keep a mold indefinitely.",artist,catch,studio
"Patrick Morrisey is President Donald Trump’s new man in West Virginia. The Mountain State Republican won a heated primary on Tuesday, defeating U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins and Don Blankenship, the former coal baron who mounted an insurgent campaign for the nomination after emerging from a year in prison following his conviction for conspiring to violate mine safety laws. Morrisey, who has served as the state’s attorney general since 2013, picked up support early in the race from the party establishment. In a victory speech, Morrisey said that “for too long the Washington elites have looked down on West Virginia and our values.” “Our victory will ensure that West Virginia rises again,” he said.  Thank you West Virginia. Now it’s onto defeating Liberal Joe Manchin in November.  #wvsen https://t.co/IlFqJZIoBC pic.twitter.com/5CfZL74nTT In the days ahead of the vote, with internal polls showing Blankenship surging, the establishment mounted a last-minute effort to make sure he didn’t become the nominee. Blankenship was the chief executive of Massey Energy when the company’s Upper Big Branch mine exploded in 2010, killing 29 miners. President Donald Trump took to Twitter on Monday to urge voters in West Virginia to reject the former coal executive, saying Blankenship “can’t win the General Election” in November. To the great people of West Virginia we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference. Problem is, Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can’t win the General Election in your State...No way! Remember Alabama. Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey! Responding to Trump’s tweet, Blankenship predicted on Monday that he would not only win the primary but that he would “beat Joe Manchin even without the support of the establishment.”  Instead, Morrisey will face two-term incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin, the president’s most dependable Democrat in the Senate, who cruised to an easy victory Tuesday over progressive primary challenger Paula Jean Swearengin to secure the Democratic nomination. Despite voting in favor of the White House’s agenda 61 percent of the time, the president has targeted Manchin, the lone Democratic senator in a state Trump won by 42 percentage points in 2016 and remains extremely popular.  Trump first waded into the race last month at a roundtable event on taxes in White Sulphur Springs. Standing beside Morrisey and Jenkins, he called on voters to oust Manchin. Blankenship did not receive an invitation. “We have to get more Republicans in office,” Trump said. “You’re going to have a chance to get a senator that’s going to vote our program. That’s going to help you in so many ways.” Blankenship tried to paint Jenkins and Morrisey as establishment pawns, while mainstream Republican groups poured money into the race in hopes of keeping Blankenship off the ticket. Upper Big Branch had made Blankenship the face of greed and recklessness for many West Virginians. A group with ties to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell aired anti-Blankenship advertisements, and McConnell prodded Trump to get involved and weigh in on behalf of Jenkins and Morrisey. Blankenship had dubbed McConnell “Cocaine Mitch” and created a firestorm when he referred to the Kentucky senator’s father-in-law as a “Chinaperson” and later defended his use of the racist term.  McConnell’s political team trolled Blankenship late Tuesday, posting a graphic of the senator in a cloud of cocaine with the words, “Thanks for playing, Don.”  Thanks for playing, @DonBlankenship. #WVSen pic.twitter.com/TV1ETgQdmu If Morrisey wins on Nov. 6, it would mark a milestone in the president’s takeover of what was once known as the bluest state in America. The state’s other senator, Shelley Capito, is a Republican who worked closely with the White House on rolling back environmental regulations to bolster coal. Last August, Gov. Jim Justice, a billionaire coal executive, announced his decision to switch parties and become a Republican at a rally with Trump. All three of the state’s U.S. representatives are Republicans. The GOP commands majorities in the state Senate and House of Delegates, and it controls five of six offices of the executive branch. But Morrisey faces a formidable opponent in Manchin. The 36-year veteran of West Virginia politics has served as governor and secretary of state and enjoys the advantage of incumbency and the biggest war chest in the race. Manchin handily defeated his primary opponent, progressive activist Paula Jean Swearengin, on Tuesday and raised nearly $6 million by last month. That’s far ahead of Morrisey’s $1.9 million. Vice President Mike Pence was among those who congratulated Morrisey on his victory. “The great people of [West Virginia] need a senator who supports the #MAGA agenda,” he posted to Twitter.  Congratulations to @MorriseyWV on his victory tonight. @RealDonaldTrump and I look forward to working with him. The great people of WV need a senator who supports the #MAGA agenda.   Dave Jamieson contributed to this report. ",who,is,coal
"Artist David Mesguich is deeply proud of his latest work. “It is projects like this which upset the sense of fatality!” he exclaims. His pride stems from the extraordinary nature of his project: instead of a gallery or museum, Mesguich has been working to beautify one of France’s harshest prisons. Last February, Mesguich worked with prison inmates who were receiving medical and psychological treatment to paint two immense murals against backdrops of gray cement and barbed wire. His goal, he says, was, “to show the prisoners... that beautiful and positive things can still come from inside them.”  Marseilles’ Baumettes prison is one of the most notorious in France. Earlier this year a scandal erupted when inmates posted images of themselves on Facebook posing with money, drugs and weapons. The proliferation of forbidden goods and weapons among prisoners highlighted Baumettes’ critical shortage of staffers.  In 2012, then-French Prison Inspector General Jean-Marie Delarue denounced Baumettes' prison conditions in a damning report, referring to them as “inhuman” and citing severe overcrowding, vermin infestations, building decay and high rates of violence between inmates. For Mesguich, working in this prison was a deeply personal project. “I encountered the prison world very early on, due to a rough upbringing,” he says. “As a young boy, I visited a number of prisons, and, as an adolescent, I knew of Baumettes, where my father was incarcerated. So, since childhood, I have reflected on isolation and separation.”  This reflection led him to the idea of a “monumental” project: two murals, each over six-feet high, painted by six prisoners in the complicated conditions that accompany incarceration.  “It was not simple to put this in place, because the constraints of the prison environment determine the way the work can happen,” Mesguich explained. “For example, I did not have the right to use a ladder to reach the top of the mural when the prisoners and the nurses were with me. And time for work on the mural was limited to two hours for the prisoners. So I came back during off-hours, between noon and two, and continued alone at the site with the ladder. The rest of the time, I waited in a room while the time passed.”

 Working in a prison was a deep calling for Mesguich, who has frequently taken his artwork to the streets. But his work also poses the question of the real benefit this type of project might have for inmates. Sociologist Jean Bérard, a professor at the University of Montreal, has worked on the history of French prison reform. According to him, “It is difficult to respond on behalf of [the prisoners] about what such an initiative can bring to them. But the limits of such initiatives are known: they involve a minority of prisoners, and cannot radically transform the way an institution of imprisonment operates.” For Didier Fassin, sociologist and author of The Shadow Of The World: An Anthropology Of The Penal Condition, the initiative is compelling -- although difficult to assess without commentary from the inmates. “It transforms the prison space, and brightens it, while emphasizing by contrast the ugly and oppressive character of the metal gates, the barbed wire, and the walls,” he says. “This being the case, the question is more general, as is the case with cities. Making murals in a city does not change its reality.” But what is essential for Mesguich is the fact that “these creations bring humanity to a place where it is lacking.” He did not wish for the inmates to serve as the manpower for the realization of his project. What he wanted was for them to participate at his side in the creation of a shared work. And so the murals bear his signature, but also those of the prisoners who worked on them: Marco, Noël, Momo, Jeoffrey and Michel.

"“It took forever and wasn’t always fun to watch…” begins the recap of Saturday’s Yankee-Red Sox game by Mike Axisa of the Yankee fan website, RiverAveBlues. The game he is referring to was Saturday’s 16-inning, nearly six-hour uber-marathon, which along the way featured a scintillating five minute umpire review. Baseball is a pastoral sport in a digital age. There’s actually great appeal in that. But even Springsteen stops the show after three hours. Nobody wants to watch anything for six hours. Not even porn. As a Yankee fan, I adore catcher Gary Sanchez, but in the course of a game he visits the mound more than the dugout. Meanwhile, the batter scratches his thigh and plans his stepping-out-of-the-box strategy. Want to improve “pace of game”? Simply ban pitcher-catcher conferences except at the top of an inning or a pitching change. There’s not a fan in the country who would complain. If pitchers and catchers insist that is not workable, then provide them with ear pieces so they could talk to each other during the game. Broadcast their conversation live. Hey, it’s the 21st century. Privacy is dead, even in baseball. Oh, and about those full infield conferences. We all know there’s no crying in baseball. Well, there are no huddles either. But nooooo, Commissioner Rob Manfred’s genius move to shorten the game was to eliminate pitches thrown for intentional walks. Never mind that many games don’t have intentional walks. Look on the positive side: Going forward, any game with ten intentional walks will now be two minutes shorter. Sweet relief! As any baseball fan knows, it’s not just the length of the games destroying the sport, it’s the start and end times. The seventh game of last year’s World Series started on a Wednesday night, a few minutes after 8, and ended at 12:30. Even without the extra inning of play and 17-minute rain delay, the game would have ended around midnight. (In case you’re wondering, the average length of a 2017 postseason game was nearly three and a half hours.) Conversely, this year’s Super Bowl was played on a Sunday, started at 6:37 and, even with the extended halftime and overtime, was over by 10:30. Night baseball games should start no later than 7. And enough with these mind-numbing extra inning borefests. During the regular season, baseball is 9-innings period. After that, decide the game with a home-run derby. Already, I hear the traditionalists howling. Let them howl. Fans love the home-run derby. In fact, the recent all-star home-run derby was more highly rated on television than the all-star game itself. Give the people what they want, which is shorter games with more drama. While I’m on the subject: No more playing Kate Smith’s revolting rendition of “God Bless America” during the 7th inning stretch at Yankee Stadium, not unless they are going to follow it with Woody Guthrie’s “This Land Is Your Land.” But no, that would add more time to the game. Ban Kate Smith. She was probably on steroids anyway. And speaking of cutting time between innings, relief pitchers should be prohibited from throwing warm-up pitches on the field. That’s what the bullpen is for. Also, there is no reason for a manager to stroll out to the mound to make a pitching change. Make the change from the dugout, get the new guy in there. And commercials: cut one thirty-second spot between innings and, viola, you have just cut at least eight minutes per game. Baseball is the only team sport without a clock, something I used to love. But now I want a pitch clock. Throw the freakin’ ball! To the batter. Not the first baseman! How many pick-off attempts does a man have to watch before you can call him a fan?  As for umpire reviews: The guys in the booth have 90 seconds. If they can’t figure it out by then, the ruling on the field was close enough. I can’t take much more of this. If none of the above works, then drastic times call for drastic measures. Two strikes and you’re out? Three fouls after two strikes and you’re out? Seven inning games? None of this could be ruled out because the six-hour, extra-inning death march can no longer be tolerated. As Captain Picard once said, “The line must be drawn here.” My next move would be to designate fans as fielders. Then, any ball, fair or foul, caught by a fan would be an out. This would not only have the advantage of shortening games, but would encourage exciting competition between fans. For example, Yankee fans at Fenway Park would want to make sure that a homer hit by Aaron Judge was not caught by a Red Sox fan and ruled an out. What a great idea!

"Continuing a blustery media tour to clean up a series of comments he’d made days ago that contradicted his new client, President Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani appeared on Fox News on Saturday night to further clarify his remarks.  Giuliani, hired recently as Trump’s lead attorney for the investigation into Russia meddling in the 2016 presidential election, said in an explosive Wednesday interview with Fox’s Sean Hannity that the president had reimbursed his longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, for the $130,000 hush payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels shortly before the election. The comments contradicted Trump’s assertion last month that he was completely in the dark about the payment. On Friday, Trump undercut Giuliani, saying his attorney had “just started [on the job] yesterday,” and would eventually “get his facts straight.” The former New York City mayor appeared to echo his boss’ sentiments on Saturday. “I’m still learning [the facts] ... I’ve been in the case for two weeks ― virtually one day in comparison to other people,” Giuliani told Fox News host Jeanine Pirro when asked whether he had misspoken when discussing the payment to Daniels. “I’m not an expert on the facts yet. I’m getting there.”  The attorney stressed, however, that there was no way his client violated any campaign finance laws. “Every campaign finance expert, Republican and Democrat, will tell you that if it was for another purpose other than just campaigns, and even if it was for campaign purposes, if it was to save his family, to save embarrassment, it’s not a campaign donation,” Giuliani said. “Even if it was a campaign donation, the president reimbursed it fully with a payment of $35,000 a month that paid for that and other expenses. No need to go beyond that. Case over,” he added. Giuliani had said in a statement Friday that his comments had not reflected “my understanding of the President’s knowledge, but instead, my understanding of these matters.” Also on Friday, Giuliani reiterated in an interview with The Washington Post that the president had re­imbursed Cohen by paying him a monthly retainer of $35,000, but suggested Trump did not know what the money was specifically being used for. “The monthly bill was paying down the expenditures ... it was not a loan,” Giuliani said. “Some of it was for taxes, some of it was for incidental expenses, it covered things that might come up.” Giuliani also told the Post that despite the firestorm over his comments, Trump was not angry with him. “He said he loves me,” Giuliani said.

"The two students killed by a fellow high schooler Tuesday in Benton, Kentucky, weren’t the first victims of such violence this month. So far this week, three shootings have happened at or near schools. At least eight more took place in the first three weeks of 2018. A student bringing a gun onto school property and firing at peers or teachers seems to occur most often, though that’s not always what happens. Two of the shootings this month were later identified as suicides. And in one instance, a 32-year-old man shot at a school bus with a pellet gun. Here’s the complete list of shooting incidents schools have faced so far this year: Jan. 23: Marshall County High School in Benton, Kentucky A 15-year-old boy opened fire inside the school, killing two and injuring 16. Jan. 22: NET Charter High School in New Orleans, Louisiana Someone driving by the school fired on a group of students in the parking lot. Only one boy was injured.  Jan. 22: Italy High School in Italy, Texas A 16-year-old boy shot a 15-year-old girl in the cafeteria. He was arrested and she was airlifted to a hospital, where she was “in good spirits” as of Tuesday. Jan. 20: Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina Following an argument, a 21-year-old Winston-Salem University student was shot and killed during a sorority event at Wake Forest University. Jan. 15: Wiley College in Marshall, Texas Two people in a car exchanged gunfire with a person in a dormitory parking lot. No one was injured, but a bullet was fired into a dorm room with three female students inside. Jan. 10: Coronado Elementary School in Sierra Vista, Arizona A 14-year-old died in a school bathroom from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Jan. 10: Grayson College in Denison, Texas A student confused a training weapon with a real one and fired a bullet through a classroom wall. No students were injured. Jan. 10: California State University in San Bernardino, California At least one shot was fired, shattering one classroom window. No students were injured. Jan. 6: School bus in Forest City, Iowa A 32-year-old man fired a pellet gun at a school bus, shattering one of the windows. No students were injured. Jan. 4: New Start High School in Seattle, Washington Two shots were fired at the school from outside the building. No students were injured.   *** With a tally of almost 300 school shootings since 2013, the country is averaging one school shooting per week, according to a report from gun control advocacy organization Everytown for Gun Safety.  Everytown defines a school shooting as when a “firearm discharges a live round inside a school building or on a school campus or grounds.” Other groups may expand the characterization to include school-like settings, like the aforementioned school bus shooting. In instances where minors shot a gun at school and authorities could determine where the child got the weapon, more than half obtained the gun at home, Everytown said. It’s also fairly common for a school shooting to result from a confrontation or verbal argument that escalates.  Experts have also begun to document the effects that fatal school shootings have on students. “These incidents can affect students’ decision about whether to stay at their school, affect their cognitive skills, and influence their behavior at school,” according to a 2015 study titled “The Effect of High School Shootings on Schools and Student Performance.” Authors Louis-Philippe Beland and Dongwoo Kim found that enrollment in ninth grade drops following a deadly shooting, as do standardized test scores in math and English for up to three years after a shooting.  A quarter of U.S. parents said they fear for their children’s safety while they are at school, according to an August 2017 Gallup survey. Parents’ concern about children’s safety reached a high after the 1999 Columbine shooting and has spiked sporadically in the wake of other major school shootings. Yet some fear the need for gun safety isn’t resonating with a wider American audience. “As we think about the lives affected today, we must not let news of school shootings become the new normal,” said Connie Courtney, a volunteer with the Kentucky chapter of Moms Demand Action, a gun safety advocacy organization. The issue doesn’t seem to be a major concern for the Trump administration, either. President Donald Trump hasn’t directly addressed any of the 10 shootings this year. Last year, he even tweeted out condolences about the wrong mass shooting. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday that the president had been briefed on the Kentucky shooting and offered his “thoughts and prayers.” UPDATE: Feb. 15 ― An earlier version of this story stated that Everytown had counted 18 shootings on campuses this year. Since this story was published, the organization has removed one incident from its list that involved a suicide at a closed school.",what,seems,peers
"On the whole, 2016 was not an easy year for women. America’s president-elect became a president-elect after footage was released of him saying, “I’m automatically attracted to beautiful women — I just start kissing them [...] I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.”  In filmmaking, gender parity developments weren’t as bleak. In January, The New York Times reported an uptick in films directed by women; in 2015, nine percent of top-grossing films had women at the helm, a two percent increase from the previous year. It’s small, but it’s something. No one ever said progress would come in floods, or even a steady stream.  Behind this progress, there’s a fleet of vocal screenwriters, directors, producers and actresses ― some of whom speak up because they’re constantly barraged with gender-related questions, others because parity is a focal point of their work. We talked with several of them this year, ranging from household names like Sally Field to directors toiling away at short filmmaking, hoping to secure feature-length funding.  Below is a sampling of takeaways on how to achieve gender equality in the film industry, culled from some of our favorite 2016 interviews and profiles. “Hugh Grant can get away with it. And ‘High Fidelity,’ I mean, John Cusack’s character is a mess, but you love him. You love him. I feel like, you know, that’s another way that gender equality needs to come in. We need to allow women characters to have all facets. To be flawed, to be wonderful, to be frustrating, to be inspiring. Because we are all those things. Period.” Read more here.   “We’re all connected. We need allies, period. We’re the minority. It’s not something I look at as a weakness, or like we should play victims. It is simply highlighting our collective voices and saying that it’s important to highlight the stories of these nuanced individuals so that when we’re out in the real world and we come across someone that feels familiar, that feels like the character you saw on TV, you think differently on how you treat them. We deserve to have the same opportunities, the same respect as any other person in society.” Read more here. “Not every man who directs a movie about the mafia is himself in the mafia. That means that women might be able to direct films that don’t directly line up with their realm of experience. It’s almost like a quota mentality. I think this goes for women and minorities both. [Movie executives] say, ‘We really want a woman to direct this movie.’ The minute you say that, you mean that we’re all the same. Any woman could direct this movie, and it doesn’t matter which one?” Read more here. “Listen, it’s always been difficult for women. That’s nothing new. You could look at the statistics in ’79 or ’80, when I did ‘Norma Rae.’ It’s always been difficult for women — that is just the way it is. It’s a good thing that people are standing up and hollering now. It isn’t just women now standing up and hollering, and I think if it were just women, we would be silenced again, as usual.” Read more here.  “Most shorts are financed independently so short filmmakers don’t have to ask permission to cast actors of color or older actors. Women directors don’t have to wait for a studio to hire them to get a chance behind the camera.” Read more here. “I probably have the same kind of past as a Julianne Moore or a Sigourney Weaver or any of them, but they far surpassed me in terms of their opportunity. And that’s the difference. Your work and what you invest in your talent doesn’t match the opportunity of the narratives that are out there. So you have to take all that you have and pour it into [playing] the detective in ‘Disturbia.’” Read more here.  “It’s so funny the things you say inside of a sisterhood. ‘Who has one boob that’s bigger than the other? Your ass is fatter.’ There’s all that ping-ponging that’s very prevalent. It’s part of my intimate experience.” Read more here. “There’s been a lot of talk in the last year or two about more roles for women, but I think that it really starts at getting more women in positions to hire women and make movies about women and to cast women in movies. So yes, having more women behind the camera is just as, if not more, important than still continuing to try and make more roles for women in Hollywood, in television and in film. And I’m excited to be a part of that.”  Read more here. “I love genre, in all its forms — Western, horror, noir, sci-fi. That’s my passion. And as a filmgoer I always resisted the idea of “women films” — or “men films,” for that matter. I think it is important to embrace women that don’t subscribe to those clichés. The idea that a woman director has, by definition, less affinity for an action scene than a male one is silly. Kathryn Bigelow can out-direct most of her male colleagues in Hollywood. It’s a matter of vision, talent, stylistic and poetic inclinations. Not gender.” Read more here. “It’s like giving birth to a new prototype of a woman. Of course it’s a fiction character and it’s certainly not someone you would meet walking in the subway, meaning it’s not a completely realistic character. But it’s a very, very special character. Even in fiction, you’ve never seen someone like her.” Read more here. “I wanted to make a film that wasn’t about a superhero, or a physically powerful woman, but just an ordinary woman with a fire inside her. What strength is possible if we can tap into that power?” Read more here. ",I,start,n’t
"Some artists are great at promoting themselves, finding buyers and generating attention to their careers. Hats off to them. For many other artists, however, having a middleman speak on behalf of their work is vital to their careers.  That middleman can be an agent or dealer (or gallery). That person might also be an art consultant. At times, art consultants are gallery owners and even museum curators who advise individuals and companies in the area of decorating or building a collection on the side. Those who are free agents, only serving the interests of their clients, generally don't have galleries and or represent particular artworks or artists; rather, they tend to work from their offices or homes, maintaining information (bios, slides, press clippings) on a variety of different artists whose work may be of interest to particular clients. Most focus exclusively on contemporary art -- works created by living artists -- while others will hunt through all styles and periods, depending upon the interests and budgets of their clients. ""Our criteria for selection revolves around our clients' tastes,"" said Josetta Sbeglia, an art consultant in St. Louis, Missouri. ""We hope we like it, too.""
These clients are a mix of private collectors, corporations, law firms and health care facilities. ""The healthcare industry is growing, and hospitals see the value of art and creating spaces that are more pleasant,"" said Talley Fischer, a sculptor in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, who has been commissioned to create large installations for a variety of health care facilities through art consultants hired by these institutions, who usually are brought in to help these institutions find artworks when in the process of building new or renovating existing spaces. Fischer noted that she promotes herself directly to art consultants.  Many companies prefer using outside consultants -- finding expertise through people who are members of the Association of Professional Art Advisors (www.artadvisors.org), for instance, although quite a few advisors who are not APAA members or work as gallery owners also offer their assistance to private and corporate clients - to hiring their own in-house curators as a cost-savings move. These companies look to acquire artwork, because ""art in offices enriches the lives of the people who work there,"" said Laura Solomon, an art advisor in New York City, who not only helps her clients purchase artwork, but will take charge of framing or installing pieces in the offices, rotating existing artworks around the offices from the collection and even putting together special exhibitions from it.  Consultants learn of artists in a variety of ways: They attend exhibitions at galleries, as well as at art fairs and juried competitions; they receive recommendations from other artists; they go to open studio events; and they are contacted directly by the artists, through the postal service, telephone or e-mail. Some consultants encourage artists sending them material, while others do not -- it makes sense to inquire by telephone or letter what, if anything, a particular consultant is interested in seeing before mailing a portfolio. Lorinda Ash, a New York City art dealer and consultant, said that ""I get phone calls, FAXes and emails from artists all the time, but that's not how I ever become interested in an artist. I find artists through going to galleries.""  On the other hand, Jennifer Wood-Patrick, an art consultant at the firm of Art Advisory Boston in Massachusetts, welcomes receiving material from artists but noted that ""we have a limited amount of time for telephone conversations and sorting through packages sent by artists."" She prefers emails from artists that describe who they are and include images.  ""Tom is very busy, so I try not to bother him with things he won't be interested in."" The Tom in question is Tom James, executive chairman of Raymond James Financial, an investment and wealth management company, and he and his wife Mary select all of the artwork - 2,400 pieces and growing - that adorn the one million square feet of office space at its St. Petersburg, Florida headquarters. The person trying not to bother him too much is Emily Kapes, curator of the art collection, who identifies the type of artwork (80 percent two-dimensional and the rest sculptural works in bronze, glass and stone) that often represent images of the American West and wildlife. She receives telephone calls, postal mail and email from artists and galleries around the country, all offering their artwork for purchase. ""I can filter out the artists that usually wouldn't be collected,"" she said, ""and, otherwise, pass things along to Tom. Tom is known for supporting living artists.""  Emily Nixon, a Chicago-based art advisor, too, receives numerous communications from artists, but she tends to rely less on submissions from people she has never heard of (""I find that artists may not know what corporations want, and many are unfamiliar with contracts and pricing,"" she said) and more through visiting art gallery exhibitions, art fairs, auctions and receiving recommendations from people (artists, dealers, auctioneers) with whom she has had a long-time association. The artists who are of greatest interest to her ""should be in a gallery and have had numerous sales."" It doesn't hurt if these artists have sold work in the past to other corporations, although that is less significant than the fact that they are represented in a gallery.",that,is,West
"GG's Brain:  Why did I let them talk me into this?  I wanted to watch my Lawrence Welk videos tonight!  Are we even in the right place?  Why do they have all these plants sitting around everywhere?  Is this a classroom or a fern bar?

Teacher:I'm honored to be teaching your first-graders.  I see many extended family members here tonight and that's wonderful.  Nothing benefits our children more than inter-generational involvement in the education process.

GG's Brain:  How can that little girl be a teacher? Kids teaching kids--is that the new thing now?  She doesn't look old enough to order a whisky sour. And what's with the giant ponytail?  They should have a grooming code, is what they need.  Put that hair into a real tight bun.  Strict.  Stern.  Show the kids you mean business.   

Teacher: Here is where the children keep their journals. I encourage all my students to spend twenty to thirty minutes working on their journals each day.  It's really exciting to see them describing their ideas and experiences, and find their own unique voices.

GG's Brain:  Journals?!  What in the name of Mother Jones does a first-grader have to put in a journal?  They've only been alive for six years, and they couldn't even talk for half that time!  Good lord, the only folks who need to keep a journal are the ones doing something worth reading about--like Lewis and Clark.  Look at these pages!  Letters all crooked, words misspelled. We had to sit still and make the letters fit between the lines!   I don't see a chalkboard around here, either.  Oh no--is my itch starting to act up again?

Teacher: This fall, we're going to be studying a lot about water.  The hydrologic cycle is a crucial part of our everyday world. I've ordered a big plastic structure, it's hard to describe.  Kind of a series of tubes and channels, so we can run water through it and see how it behaves under different conditions, measure flow rates, and think up different kinds of experiments.

GG's Brain:  WATER?!  You're gonna spend all that time looking at water?  I can tell ya what it does--it runs downhill!  Goes outta the bathtub drain!  No mystery there.  Heaven help us, if ya wanna teach kids about water, tell 'em not to jump in the darn puddles when it's raining.  Tell 'em what it does to a good pair of leather shoes.  Anybody seen what good leather shoes cost nowadays?  And damn this itching anyway!

Teacher:  I teach things in a kind of, for want of a better word, a whole-istic style.  That is, we work on several subjects at once.  It's a process without preconditions.  So when your child is drawing a picture, he or she may be using the picture to learn about geography, or dinosaurs, or whatever we're discussing at that particular moment. 

GG's Brain:  Is she makin' this stuff up?  Holy baloney, I'm looking at a picture here, it's got a house, and a turtle with a giraffe's head, and three wavy lines.  And the title of the picture is 'Arithmetic.'  For cryin' out loud, when we did arithmetic we had to show a few numbers, and a 'plus' sign, or something!  These kids get to show a cow flying an airplane and call it history!  No wonder they can't get good jobs!

Teacher:  By the way, if anyone has questions about the curriculum or my methodology, please feel free to put your hand up.  I'm happy to take questions. GG's Brain:  Here's my chance.  I'll say, ummm, I'll say my neck hurts and I need to go lie down.   Grab a hall pass and head for the nurse's office.  Merciful God, if you're listening, please make sure they have some Bag Balm in the first-aid kit!",it,got,head
"I can’t accept my post-baby body. I just can’t. There, I said it. In a time where female empowerment is running rampant and there is an influx of articles and blog posts about how incredible the female form is (particularly post-partum), I am struggling to accept my body after two babies. I read the words of these strong women who talk about embracing their love handles, saggy boobs and extra padding because it was all part of their journey to have their babies. In theory, I totally get it and they are 100 percent right. I desperately want to feel that way. But if I’m being honest, I’m on the opposite side of the spectrum. I’ve birthed two amazing little humans, and it wreaked havoc on my body. I’m a petite woman, barely reaching 5’1”. I’ve been active my whole life and in shape, even working out through both pregnancies. But when you’re petite, one extra pound looks like five and it feels like 10. Now at the ripe age of 40 and two kids later, I don’t even feel like I am in my own body. I look in the mirror and could cry. Sometimes I actually do. Uncomfortable in my own damn skin. My once perky boobs are “mushy,” as my 9-year-old likes to say. I’m sporting love handles and that pooch that has become a cruel rite of passage after housing humans in your body. Don’t even get me started on my ass and thighs. If there is a spot that has the ability to jiggle, it’s jiggling. People will say to me, “You look AMAZING!” or “You’re tiny!” and I know it’s heartfelt, but I don’t feel it. Those people see me in a different light. They don’t see me naked and vulnerable. My husband tells me regularly that I am beautiful, sexy, and gorgeous but I don’t feel any of those things. Not one bit. All of the compliments in the world do not curtail my full-fledged tantrums while getting dressed. You know what I’m talking about. The moments when NOTHING seems to fit. You rip one shirt off after another and throw them, with force, across your bedroom because you’re so fu*king over it. You throw on Spanx to go to a PTA meeting on a Monday just so your muffin top doesn’t spill over your jeans that already make you feel like you’re wearing a sausage casing. You stare at your closet willing something to appear that will make you feel pretty, but you’re in that weird phase where you are well past maternity clothes and your “regular” clothes just aren’t cutting it. And here’s my biggest concern with all of it. I have two little girls watching my every move. They hear everything even when I think they are sucked into the iPad watching those unbearable videos of little girls unboxing toys. My older daughter said to me the other day, “Mommy, why were you saying your arms are fat and that you hate them?” In my head I’m screaming, half-joking, “Have you seen them?” But all I can think is, holy sh*t I need to get this in check… they’re onto me. Instilling a positive body in my girls is my job. It’s a huge responsibility. My 3rd grader is already coming home talking about peers saying they’re fat and it makes me want to throw up. So I’m stuck in this paradox where I hate my own body and I need to teach my girls self-love and body acceptance. It’s a tough spot. And all I can think is why can’t I be more like the women writing these beautiful pieces about loving their imperfections? Why can’t I just say f*ck it and not care that my jeans are too tight despite the hours I’m clocking with my jogging stroller and watching every calorie I put in my body? I do not lack confidence. Some have called me a firecracker. I have more moxie than most. But I just can’t accept my post-baby body, and it’s messing with me.",I,lack,confidence
"President Donald Trump addressed the National Rifle Association’s annual convention on Friday and profusely thanked Kanye West for doubling his African-American polling numbers. “Kanye West must have some power,” Trump said. “I doubled my African-American poll numbers. We went from 11 to 22 in one week. Thank you, Kanye, thank you.” Trump went on to say that he initially thought the increase “must be a mistake” and that even “the pollsters thought that was a mistake.” Pres. Trump claims he doubled his support among African-Americans in past week.""Kanye West must have some power...Thank you, Kanye."" https://t.co/YlVHW6ff42 pic.twitter.com/WgN0eUj5uv The polling numbers Trump was referring to were likely from a Reuters/Ipsos poll that asked respondents, “Do you approve or disapprove about the way Donald Trump is handling his job as President?” Filtered for black male respondents, the poll does show Trump’s approval increasing from about 11 to about 22 percent. For black people overall, the increase was from about 9 to about 17 percent. It’s worth noting that polls by YouGov/Economist and SurveyMonkey did not reveal much of a shift in black Americans’ opinions of Trump between April 19 and May 1. Many on social media couldn’t help but comment on Trump’s remarks. Donald Trump thanks Kanye West again during his #NRAConvention speech while misrepresenting his approval rating with black voters. Now is a good time to mention that Trump still hasn't thanked Waffle House hero James Shaw Jr. pic.twitter.com/Sk4nQ4FALU At the NRA, Trump said, Kanye West must have some power. I doubled my African American poll numbers"" So, Trump is insinuating that Kanye West is right to say slavery was a choice? Are you kidding me?#NRAConvention President Trump now thanking Kanye West for his support.What a time to be alive. So far in his NRA speechTrump has praised: Paul Manafort, Kanye West, Diamond and Silk, a bunch of TX politiciansand dissed: the media, Obama, John Kerry and John McCain ""President Donald Trump thanks Kanye West on stage at the NRA convention"" we live in a nightmare Mad Lib Trump speaking to the NRA and thanking Kanye for helping his poll numbers is truly the 9th circle of hell. Trump’s praise for West at the convention isn’t particularly surprising. He’s been effusive about the rapper since West’s tweetstorm last week in which he lauded the president and shared a snapshot of a MAGA hat. Trump thanked West at the time with a quote-tweet, and also tweeted about the “Famous” singer two days later, crediting West with performing “a great service” to the black community. You don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I don't agree with everything anyone does. That's what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought. Thank you Kanye, very cool! https://t.co/vRIC87M21X Kanye West has performed a great service to the Black Community - Big things are happening and eyes are being opened for the first time in Decades - Legacy Stuff! Thank you also to Chance and Dr. Darrell Scott, they really get it (lowest Black & Hispanic unemployment in history). Trump has made claims before that black and Hispanic unemployment rates are at or near record lows, but, as NPR fact-checked, “it’s generally a stretch for presidents to take credit for job creation.” West has recently been embroiled in controversy for saying he believed slavery was “a choice.” Just moments after Trump thanked him, he tweeted two missives: “if you’re in the way of your own life you’ll end up in the way of other people’s lives too” and “enjoy the present.”",slavery,doubled,numbers
"The NBC commentator who was skewered by viewers for insensitive remarks he made during the Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Pyeongchang, South Korea, is no longer covering the games, the broadcaster announced on Monday. “Joshua Cooper Ramo has completed his responsibilities for NBC in Pyeongchang, and will have no further role on our air,” an NBC spokesman told Reuters. The network also said Ramo had been hired only for the opening ceremonies of the games.  Ramo, a former journalist who served as an on-air analyst for NBC, infuriated Koreans on Friday when he flippantly commented on the history between Japan and South Korea during the opening ceremony. Spotting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Ramo mused that “every Korean will tell you that Japan is a cultural and technological and economic example, has been so important to their own transformation.” Though Ramo acknowledged that Japan “occupied Korea from 1910 to 1945,” Koreans and others blasted the commentator for glossing over this brutal history, which included the sexual slavery of tens of thousands of Korean women during World War II. To this day, the former occupation continues to strain the relationship between the two nations. Facing intense backlash, including displeasure from the Pyeongchang Organizing Committee and a petition signed by thousands who called Ramo’s comments “deeply hurtful and outrageous,” NBC publicly apologized on Sunday for his remark.  “We apologized quickly both in writing and on television for a remark made by one of our presenters during Friday night’s opening ceremony,” a spokesman said. “We’re very gratified that Pyeongchang’s organizing committee has accepted that apology.” Clarification: Language in this story has been updated to include NBC’s explanation that Ramo had only been hired to cover the Olympic Games’ opening ceremonies.",occupation,continues,nations
" Ethics lawyers and historians have argued that Donald Trump has blurred the line between his public office and private business interests in an unprecedented fashion.    In another sense, it’s part of a much larger social trend.   Commercial entreaties – whether in the form of magazine ads, radio jingles or television spots – have long been a part of modern life. But advertising is now encroaching on public space as never before.   Cities and states now grant businesses the right to put their names and logos on parking meters, bridges, fire hydrants – even lifeguard swimsuits. Public parks intended to offer a respite from the travails of daily life now allow retailers to advertise amidst historical sites and nature preserves. School boards ink deals with all sorts of businesses to help them meet their budgetary needs.  It’s not just public space that is filling up with brand shout-outs. In conducting research for a new book on modern marketing and its regulation, I discovered that a host of once ad-free environments – from the living room to our friendships – are now becoming sites for ads or surveillance technologies designed to make them more effective.   Some might shrug, calling the ad creep an inevitable part of modern life. But there are dangers to this trend, along with legal remedies – if people care enough to actually do something.   New marketing techniques and technologies allow businesses to reach consumers in new ways and venues. One space becoming increasingly critical to market researchers is the home.   Smart technologies – from Microsoft’s Xbox One to Vizio televisions – now come embedded with what could be described as “spying” capabilities. These devices can record activities once considered private, like the movies we decide to watch and even our facial expressions while playing a video game. This information becomes part of a digital profile used by advertisers to get a better portrait of who we are and how we can be convinced to make a purchase.   Meanwhile, every time we sign on to Facebook or search Google on our personal computers or smartphones, we are adding to vast stockpiles of market research. This kind of surveillance is hard to escape. Marketers have moved past cookies: They can now identify individual users from the number of fonts in their browser or the rate at which their particular computer’s battery loses its charge.  Even our brains have become fair game for advertising annexation. A landmark 2004 study asked subjects to take sips of Coke and Pepsi while a machine measured blood flow in their brains. When the brand was a secret, participants expressed a slight preference for Pepsi. But when the brand names were revealed before taking a sip, participants, both verbally and neurologically, revealed a preference for Coke. The study was widely heralded as proof of the ability of advertising to actually change our brain chemistry, to instill emotional markers that can trump objective evaluation of the actual product.  Since then, companies have spent millions to record activity in consumers’ brains to better capture the desires we won’t or can’t articulate. Some major ad campaigns we currently see – from Samsung to Campbell’s soup – reflect the results from this new neuromarketing research.  Our friendships and social networks aren’t immune. Marketers target “micro-influencers” – often people with modest Instagram or Twitter followings – that can be leveraged to sell products or services on social media. While Federal Trade Commission rules require endorsers to acknowledge the compensation they receive in return for giving favorable plugs for a product, enforcement is minimal.      Even those bullish about these new marketing gambits do admit that they can be annoying. Still, a common response to complaints about the growing presence of ads is “What’s the harm?” As the argument goes, being annoyed is a small price to pay for subsidized public infrastructure, free online content and exposure to ads more attuned to our actual interests and needs.  My research shows, however, that there are significant costs to opening up our lives to advertisers. One is a loss of consumer agency. Reliance on brain scans to design more effective commercials strips audiences of their ability to consciously shape the advertising content they see and hear. Market research used to rely on focus groups and surveys, not the unfiltered disclosure of brain activity. The result can be advertising campaigns that celebrate biases or behaviors we would rather keep hidden from view. For example, thanks to data gleaned from brain scans, Frito-Lay launched a series of ads encouraging antisocial practices like intentionally putting Cheetos in another person’s load of white laundry. When directly questioned, sample viewers objected to the ads’ gleeful embrace of vandalism, but MRI readings told a different story.   Another cost comes from how advertising can change an environment’s character.    The civic values meant to be instilled by public schooling now must compete with the materialist messages of the sporting goods stores and clothing retailers that advertise in cafeterias and hallways. The use of micro-influencers on social media could make us less trusting, never knowing if that online friend is really a corporate shill.   And as commercial spying becomes routine, norms change to permit snooping in other parts of our life. Witness the recent use of facial recognition technology by churches to record the attendance rates of their parishioners and the placement of monitoring devices on once-innocuous objects like Barbie dolls and children’s toothbrushes so parents can keep tabs on their children.      So what’s to be done? It isn’t realistic for consumers to abandon Google, to drop off of Facebook, to take their kids out of public school or to stop using public infrastructure. Halfhearted measures – like regulations requiring consumers to opt in to some of these troubling advertising practices – won’t do much to change things either. Studies show that such legislative nudges don’t work, that motivated marketers can get us to opt in if they apply enough pressure.    Instead of defaults, the law needs to create hard and fast rules preventing the entry of advertising and corporate spying into these spaces. This kind of reform doesn’t require a sea change in legal attitudes. The history of advertising regulation in the United States reveals several episodes where lawmakers moved to put an end to objectionable selling strategies fueled by new technologies.    The American right to privacy emerged in the late 19th century as a response to advertisers using the relatively new technology of photography to take pictures of people without their permission, and then using these photos to sell products. Judges objected to this forced blending of the personal with the commercial, with one court equating the practice to enslavement by a “merciless master.” Similar objections caused lawmakers to act against a barrage of scenery-obscuring billboards in the early 20th century and subliminal advertising in the 1950s. Of course, not every new advertising strategy has met with a legal response. But the historical record shows strong precedent for using the law to keep some areas of life off limits from commercial entreaties.  A normalization process can easily occur once advertising enters a new territory. Take pre-film advertising in movie theaters. When it was first introduced in the 1990s, audiences howled at the presence of commercials before the trailers and the actual movie. Lawsuits were filed and new legislation proposed to stop the practice. But over time, the lawsuits and legislation sputtered out. Surveys now suggest that audiences have become ambivalent to the presence of pre-film commercials.  The story of pre-film ads should be a cautionary tale. Without a coordinated effort, this same normalization process will take place in more and more spaces, engulfing them into the vast, existing space of commercial white noise.

"Summer is an ideal time for podcast listening, I think. The weather’s nice, which makes for plenty of opportunities for a long stroll while chugging through your audio playlist. You’ll likely do some traveling, which generally involves hours of dullness as you soar down the highway or through the sky. A favorite show could accompany you as you stretch out on a blanket, sunglasses donned, thinking about how chill life is. All of these podcast-listening opportunities obviously need podcasts to go along with them. If your regular-rotation shows aren’t quite doing it for you, or you just want some new voices in your earbuds, try one — or all! — of these 11 quality shows.  If you already love Aminatou Sow from the popular “Call Your Girlfriend” podcast, add this one to your lineup. “On She Goes” focuses on travel stories and advice for women of color, in order to both empower and serve as a practical resource. Even if travel plans aren’t in your immediate future, the stories Sow highlights will inspire your sense of adventure. Listen on Apple Podcasts or SoundCloud.

Ashley Ahearn ponders that question by going around the U.S. to learn personal stories that come from a changing environment. In the few episodes already released, she covers eco-anxiety, composting one’s body and the ethics of having children in the midst of global warming. A recent review on iTunes called the podcast a blend of “Radiolab” and “Planet Money,” which feels right — an informative show in a sound-rich and powerful audioscape.

"By Rabbi Mark Wildes, with contributions by Michelle Soffen Dedicated to the memory of slain student Second Lieutenant Richard W. Collins III It’s 8:00pm. The world around comes to a sudden halt. Cars break mid highway as phones are put away and conversations paused. A nation unites in complete stillness, and for an entire minute, no sound can be heard for miles but the cry of a siren. This soul penetrating ring is the official start of Yom Hazikaron - Memorial Day in Israel; the national day of remembrance set aside for honoring fallen heroes who died in active duty defending the Jewish homeland, and for the thousands of civilian victims of terror. Throughout the next 24 hours, graves are visited, ceremonies held, and tears shed. By law, all places of entertainment are closed and tv stations mark the solemnity of the day. One channel screens the entire list of names of all those being remembered. 23,544 - The number of Israeli soldiers remembered this past May 1. 3,117 - The number of victims of terror in Israel also remembered this past May 1. 21 Million - the number of cases of beer purchased to wash down the 818 hot dogs consumed per second during “peak hot dog season”, kicked off on Memorial Day in the United States just a few weeks later. This is in memory of the 1.3 Million members of the armed services who lost their lives in conflict, and the  42+ Million veterans who have served the United States during war time.   Barbecues, beer, beef, 2 for 1 sales, marathons, auto racing, and travel - this is what Memorial Day looks like for the average American. It is the unofficial start of the summer season, a day for busting out the white pants, and enjoying a day off work. An Israeli friend of mine visiting the U.S. experienced Memorial Day here for the first time last year. “I was at first horrified,” she explained to me. “I was expecting something similar to what we do in Israel. I couldn’t understand how you are all so happy - drinking, going to the beach, having barbecues, on the day you are remembering the people who sacrificed their lives for you. But then an American friend explained to me that it is not meant to be a solemn day here - that instead of mourning you choose to celebrate the many freedoms the U.S. cherishes; the freedoms that the army fights to protect.” She paused to think, then continued. “It makes sense; you should of course celebrate your wonderful country - but it could never be this way for us on Memorial Day in Israel. I don’t want you to think I am judging you; for us, it is just different. There is not a single person who is not directly affected by the conflicts we face. We all know someone personally in active duty, and we all know someone either in our immediate circles or extended circles who has died because of the conflict. I think until we have security and peace with our neighbors, it will continue to be an extremely sad day for us.” My friend’s remarks got me thinking. How did the U.S. Memorial Day become what it is? How did it start? And have we come so far as a country to merit a day of pure celebration marked with little to no solemnity for the average American? Most Americans know that Memorial Day, despite its festive nature, is about honoring the nation’s war dead. Few Americans, however, and including myself until recently, know the real history of the holiday. For an in depth look at the history and transformation of the day, I highly recommend the book “Race and Reunion”, by David W. Blight, a professor of history and the director of the Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance and Abolition at Yale. For a quicker summary, see the article he wrote for The New York Times in May of 2011, “Forgetting Why We Remember”. The very first Memorial Day commemoration occurred on May 1, 1865. It was the last year of the Civil War, and Charleston, S.C. had been taken over by the Union Troops. When the Confederate Troops fled, they left behind a mass grave of Union Prisoners, hastily buried after being kept in horrific conditions on what had once been the town race track. According to archival evidence discovered by Blight, “after the Confederate evacuation of Charleston black workmen went to the site, reburied the Union dead properly, and built a high fence around the cemetery. They whitewashed the fence and built an archway over an entrance on which they inscribed the words, ‘Martyrs of the Race Course’.” Along with White Abolitionists, the Black people of Charleston, mostly former slaves, staged a procession of 10,000 around the track. “The war was over, and Memorial Day had been founded by African-Americans in a ritual of remembrance and consecration. The war, they had boldly announced, had been about the triumph of their emancipation over a slaveholders’ republic. They were themselves the true patriots,” Blight explains. Many early Memorial Day events on the Union side took on a similar character of both solemn honoring of the Union dead, as well as remembering the importance of the emancipationist cause. Only a short while later, as reconstruction ended in the South and unity became a political necessity, a new Memorial Day took shape. This day honored both the Union and Confederate fallen soldiers, dropping the struggle for equal rights of all Americans and emancipation from the conversation, replacing it with a call for moving forward together as a new nation. In a 2007 op-ed for the New York Times, referencing Blight’s work, Adam Cohen argues the disservice done to our country by forgetting the original meaning of Memorial Day. He explains that “When Woodrow Wilson spoke at Gettysburg on the 50th anniversary of the battle, in a Memorial Day-like ceremony, he avoided the subject of slavery... and declared ‘the quarrel’ between North and South ‘forgotten.’ The ceremony was segregated, and a week later Wilson’s administration created separate white and black bathrooms in the Treasury Department. It would be another 50 years before the nation seriously took up the cause of racial equality again.” Perhaps dropping this aspect of the holiday from the national conversation seriously delayed the Civil Rights Movement. After WWI, the meaning of Memorial Day expanded to become about the fallen in all of our nation’s wars. Over time, the holiday took on a more and more commercial character to become what it is today. Yes, graves are still decorated, government memorial services and parades are still held, but nearly all sense of sanctity and solemnity have been lost. Cohen asserts, “Memorial Day... began with the conviction that to properly honor the war dead, it is necessary to honestly contemplate the cause for which they fought.” This, I believe, is why Israel’s Memorial Day is so starkly different from that of the United States. The narrative of Yom Hazikaron is one that not only honors the fallen, but is connected to the causes for which they died - the 2000 year old struggle for Jewish self determination, security, and peace in their indigenous homeland; for the idea that no blood, including Jewish blood, is cheap; and for the hope that all life on Earth will be treated as precious. The meaning of Yom Hazikaron and the weight it carries is woven into the very fabric of Israeli society; it is in the tossing and turning at night of every mother with a child serving out his/her mandatory conscription in the IDF, in the threat of terrorism that looms regularly, and in the too many friends and loved ones lost on all sides of the conflict. This trauma and hope is what that 8pm siren and the events of the day urge Israelis to come together and contemplate.   Yes, the Jewish People have achieved unprecedented levels of autonomy and dignity with the blessing that is the modern state of Israel. Part of their dream has been realized. For this, Israelis celebrate boldly and proudly on Yom Ha’atzmaut (Israeli Independence Day which comes right after Israeli Memorial Day). Until there is peace, however, the struggle of the Jewish people and their fallen heroes remains unfinished, and Israel’s day in memoriam is a day in mourning. Though there is nothing inherently wrong with honoring the memory of America’s fallen soldiers by celebrating the freedoms we treasure, when we become so far detached from the causes for which they died and the original meaning of the holiday, we do a disservice to the country and ideals we intend to celebrate. Perhaps if on the U.S. Memorial Day we contemplated more directly the causes for which our soldiers have fought and fallen, from the Revolutionary War, through the Civil War, all the way to our current War on Terror - maybe we would realize that while we have cause to celebrate, we also have reason still to mourn. As Memorial Day Weekend in the U.S. approaches, I find myself thinking about the wars we continue to fight as a country both abroad and at home. I am thinking of the victims of the recent attack in Manchester and their families. I am praying for the triumph of all peace-loving people against hatred and radical extremist perversions of Islam. I am also thinking about Richard W. Collins III; the 23 year old black student who had just been commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Army and was soon to train in defending the U.S. against chemical attacks. This amazing young man was cut down in his prime; murdered this past weekend by a 22 year old white student at a bus stop for refusing to move. Though officials say it is too early to claim this a hate crime, it is being investigated as such as the perpetrator was a member of a white supremacist facebook group “Alt-Reich: Nation”, known for espousing hate against Black people. Many are calling the murderer a “home grown terrorist,” and the murder a lynching. Time will tell what his motives were, but without a doubt we are living in an era all too stained by racial inequality, partisan intolerance, and senseless hatred. Are we truly connected to the causes for which our soldiers fought and continue to fight? Do we as a nation have with enough significance and clarity the conversation around the continued struggle for civil rights (the natural extension of emancipation)? Does every American in practice have the equal right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? The answer, unfortunately, is no. Yes, I will be having a beer this Memorial Day. Life is too precious to stop celebrating. However, I will also be taking time with my family to reflect and honor the memory of our soldiers the best way we can: by connecting to their causes and by remembering that their fight is not done. Indeed, we have much to celebrate, but we also have a long ways to go.",murder,calling,murderer
"By Jane Meredith Adams Lacrosse came to Avonna Usher, a 16-year-old junior at Granite Bay High School northeast of Sacramento, the way sports come to many young athletes — at school. The pure pleasure of hurling a 40-yard pass has driven her to attack her learning disability, improve her grades and win a verbal commitment to play lacrosse for the University of Oregon Ducks. But a new study finds that many California schools aren’t reporting their data, as required by a recent state law, to show that girls are getting the same shot at team sports as boys. “Many are just ignoring the law altogether,” said Kim Turner, a senior staff attorney at the nonprofit Legal Aid at Work, which runs the Fair Play for Girls in Sports Project and produced the study. The law, Senate Bill 1349 by Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson, D-Santa Barbara, is a data disclosure statute. It’s meant to force K-12 schools to tell the story, through data, of how they are serving girl athletes, a cohort historically relegated to worn-out fields, undesirable practice schedules and meager sports options compared to boy athletes. Without the data, it’s tough to tell if schools are complying with the 1972 federal Title IX law and the California Education Code, which require equal sports opportunities for girls and boys in federally funded K-12 schools. Title IX applies to athletics in colleges and universities as well. Fewer than half of the high schools surveyed by the Fair Play for Girls in Sports Project have posted their sports participation numbers on their school or district websites, as the law requires them to do every year, the study found. The first deadline was June 30, 2016 for 2015-16 interscholastic sports team participation; data for the 2016-17 school year were to be posted by June 30 of this year. The data that were posted, the study found, indicated a six-point gap between the percentage of girls enrolled in schools and the percentage of school athletes that are girls. “Girls across California are getting far fewer chances than boys to play sports, despite accounting for approximately half of students, and despite studies that show that girls are equally interested in sports in comparison with boys,” the study said. The study surveyed 107 California high schools, randomly selected, and found that 48 percent had posted the required three elements of data: the number of girl and boy team athletes, the number of teams offered to girls and boys, and total enrollment of girls and boys. From that information, parents and students could calculate whether the percentage of girls and boys on sports teams is proportional to their enrollment, as required by Title IX. The Fair Play for Girls in Sports Project has posted an online tool for users to enter school data and calculate whether there is a gap in sports participation rates by gender. The schools that posted data had the same demographics as the schools that did not post data — about 54 percent of students were eligible for free and reduced price meals based on low family income, and about 70 percent of those enrolled were students of color. “Inequities in sports for girls in California — and failure to post data that could shed a light on the issue — seem to cross all racial and socioeconomic lines,” the study said. The study did not list the names of the schools. No research has found that girls are less interested in competitive athletic teams than boys, according to the Women’s Sports Foundation, a nonprofit founded by tennis great Billie Jean King. Obstacles include a lack of teams and, more subtly, the sense that girls’ sports teams don’t matter as much as boys’ teams, according to the foundation. At a forum with new Oakland Unified Superintendent Kyla Johnson-Trammell last month, Jayda Hicks, a 16-year-old Oakland High student who plays first base on the softball team, said school leaders “don’t take the girls’ sports teams seriously.” Jayda added, “We don’t get as much recognition as the boys do.” And school leaders, she said, don’t pay attention to the way slighting the girls’ teams deflates the players. “They don’t notice how that affects us,” she said. “That can affect our daily lives and it can affect our performance in schools.” At Granite Bay High, part of the Roseville Joint Union High School District, Avonna said boys’ teams are held in higher esteem by school staff. Administrators show up to cheer on the male athletes, she said, but the only fans at girls’ lacrosse games are parents of the players. “The only time the principal comes is when we’re in the semi championships, and that’s because it’s required,” she said. Before Title IX passed in 1972, fewer than 300,000 girls played high school sports across the nation. In 2012, more than 3.2 million girls played on high school teams, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations. But girls are still underrepresented in school athletics. Schools have three ways to prove they are serving girl athletes: provide data that show gender representation on teams is proportionate to overall enrollment, prove they are moving toward that goal or prove through a school survey that girls are not interested in playing on a sports team. In California, a court ruling and the data-disclosure law are pressing schools to do more. In 2014, the Ninth Circuit District Court upheld a lower court ruling that the Sweetwater Union High School District had “not fully and effectively accommodated the interests and abilities of female athletes” and was out of compliance with Title IX. Veronica Ollier, a member of the softball team, was the lead plaintiff in a class action suit that charged that the district gave girls’ teams subpar playing fields, facilities, schedules and transportation vehicles compared to the boys’ teams. In addition, the suit charged the district with retaliating against the girls who complained by firing the softball coach. The court agreed with those charges. The new data-disclosure law could provoke additional lawsuits. On the collegiate athletic level, Title IX lawsuits surged after 1994, when colleges were required to publicly disclose sports participation by gender, similar to the requirements of the California law, said Michael Smith, a partner at the Lorenzo Smith law firm that represents many California school districts. Smith declined to be interviewed, but in a video presentation on Senate Bill 1349 he said, “That’s the kind of scenario we could be facing after the full implementation of SB 1349 here in California.” He urged districts: “Let’s look comprehensively at our sports programs and decide whether or not we are providing equity at both the female and the male athletic competition levels.” He added, “Let’s in fact achieve sports equity in all of our California school districts.” Girls who play team sports are more likely to have better grades in school, higher levels of self-confidence and earn more money in future employment than non-athletes, according to the Women’s Sports Foundation. In Granite Bay, Avonna said sports are a way to counteract the cultural put-down of women. “We are already degraded as women,” she said. “It’s usually a guy thing — they go out and play sports. To be a girl and woman and showing the world I can do this, it’s good.” This story originally appeared on EdSource.",girls,played,Associations
"By Douglas Main, LiveScience Staff Writer: The United States hasn't been any stranger to hurricanes in the last eight years. Hurricane Sandy, for example, caused about $50 billion in damage and was responsible for more than 150 U.S. deaths last year, although the storm was technically an extra-tropical cyclone when it hit. But surprisingly, not a single major hurricane, defined as a Category 3 storm or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale —with minimum wind gusts of at least 111 mph (178 km/h) — has directly hit the United States in nearly eight years. That's twice as long as any major hurricane landfall ""drought"" since 1915, and by far the longest on record since data began being collected prior to 1900. As of today (Sept. 12), it's been 2,880 days since Hurricane Wilma, the last major hurricane to strike the United States, made landfall on Oct. 24, 2005. The reasons behind this drought turn out to be a combination of atmospheric wind patterns, how close to the coast hurricanes form and luck. Luck Luck probably plays the biggest role in the lack of major hurricane hits, said Chris Landsea, the science and operations officer at the National Hurricane Center (NHC). As noted, it's not like the last eight years have been quiet. Seven hurricanes, for example, have made landfall in the United States, according to government records. A pair of these, hurricanes Gustav and Ike in September 2008, were Category 2 storms, and the latter nearly became a major hurricane, Landsea told LiveScience. Throughout the Caribbean and Central America, there have been a total of nine major hurricane landfalls since 2005, said Brian McNoldy, a researcher at the University of Miami. (Cuba alone has experienced four major hurricane landfalls in the last eight years, McNoldy added.) [Hurricane Season 2013: Storm Coverage] There are two major factors that help explain this, though, Landsea said. For one, most hurricanes haven't formed close to shore in the last few years. Formation near American soils — as happened in the cases of hurricanes Katrina, Wilma and Rita in 2005 — understandably increases the chance a hurricane will make landfall as a strong cyclone. Second, weather patterns have steered many hurricanes away from the mainland. Over the past few years, for example, there has often been a dip in the jet stream over the East Coast, which has helped steer storms away from shore, Landsea said. ""Most hurricanes that have approached have turned back,"" he said. ""But that's something that's extremely variable, and not predictable."" As to exactly why hurricanes haven't formed near shore and have been steered away from land, Landsea couldn't say. ""I can say the 'what' but not the 'why' — the science on this isn't completely clear,"" he said. ""I'd say it's mostly luck."" [Image Gallery: Hurricane Season 2013] Experts agree Other experts agreed that the drought was mostly a matter of chance and didn't reflect some deep underlying pattern. ""One of the biggest factors is luck,"" McNoldy said. ""It's just a fluke, and good luck,"" said Jason Samenow, a meteorologist with the Washington Post's Capital Weather Gang blog. ""We certainly haven't been in a quiet pattern."" Jeff Weber, a scientist with the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., went further, saying that the ""period of record is too short to make any assumptions based on this statistic."" While this is a long stretch ""without a 'major hurricane' making landfall, there's not enough data to make this statistically significant,"" he added. ""I am in the camp that this is a natural variation and that over time it will average back out."" ""Our time will come again,"" as McNoldy, who lives in hurricane-prone South Florida, put it.

"Don’t mess with librarians.  New York Observer columnist Andre Walker learned that lesson this week when he called for the closure of public libraries, and posted tweets critical of librarians. Nobody goes to libraries anymore. Close the public ones and put the books in schools. https://t.co/Cimy1V81n5 Thousands responded to Walker’s initial tweet, noting the valuable role libraries play in communities. Among the educators and advocates tweeting their responses was Alex “The Angriest Librarian” Halpern:  Hang tight folks, because I am about to drop some necessary knowledge on you. First off, library usage is on the RISE motherfuckers. https://t.co/reWrJj3XCo As conservatives have taken over state and local governments, and the NO MORE TAXES crowd has gotten their way, public space has decreased. That means is that there are a lot fewer free, public gathering places in America anymore. What's one? The motherfucking public library. If you, like this jackalope, think libraries are just warehouses for books, you are sorely and embarrassingly mistaken. Sorely. In addition to meeting a community's need for educational and recreational materials, PARTICULARLY FOR YOUNG FAMILIES... public libraries are evolving to meet the demands of the 21st Century, unlike the neanderthal who sparked this thread. Books? Books make up a RAPIDLY decreasing percentage of a library's budget. You want to check out technology? get a library card. You need internet access because you are one of the WAY TOO MANY underserved and marginalized persons in America? Go to the library. You need a safe place to learn about yourself, LGBT teen? Come to the library. You need to learn English to get a job? Come to the library. You need to close libraries because you have no idea what the fuck they do? Stay the fuck home and shut your mouth. Just kidding, everyone is welcome at the library, even the backwards thinking simpletons who want to cut our budgets. I could go on and on about what libraries do in the 21st century, but I'm too fucking steamed, so if you want to know, ask. More than 100 people responded to Halpern’s tweets, praising his comments and sharing their support for libraries. So, the Angriest Librarian was happy again.  I am heartened by the number of people who love their library. I am now less mad online. A friendly message to all my new followers: go get yourself a fucking library card. But then, Walker doubled down on his initial claim.  I know this makes Librarians angry but shutting libraries and putting the books into schools would be an absolute good. https://t.co/AEy4X0iAAx This fucking guy is still going https://t.co/jDXVnrqX3w Librarians are like French teachers. These jobs exist in order to pay the wages of sad people who can't get proper work. Imagine being this guy https://t.co/sxbShhkARL After receiving a flood of responses, Walker walked back his original comments. Dear #Library users, I surrender! pic.twitter.com/1F0cog6xo0 As for Halpern, he now has thousands of new library-loving followers: Library twitter is lit af this week get on board The 6000 of you who followed me in the last day are going to be very disappointed when I return to tweeting about star wars and baseball",You,need,job
"WASHINGTON ― Top Trump administration officials and a bipartisan group of powerful lawmakers have formed a tacit alliance that could be the best hope for hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims who fled violence and persecution in Myanmar last year. The State Department and the White House have taken striking steps to push Myanmar to punish those responsible for the crackdown. And on Capitol Hill, Democrats and Republicans have rallied behind measures to increase pressure on Myanmar’s leaders. President Donald Trump has been largely silent on the Rohingya so far. But the unlikely collaboration on one of the world’s largest human rights crises could result in one of the few major international accomplishments of his time in office thus far — if Trump decides to personally join the effort, that is, and if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) stops blocking votes on the issue. “We really think this could be a success story for the administration,” said Francisco Bencosme, an advocacy official at the nonprofit group Amnesty International. “There’s been high-level engagement. But at the same time, the buck stops with the president. We haven’t seen President Trump speak out for the Rohingya. Until there’s presidential leadership, we still think there’s room for more.” Myanmar’s military and allied Buddhist militias killed and raped thousands of Rohingya last year after Rohingya militants attacked security outposts in August. Some 700,000 members of the historically demonized ethnic and religious minority group fled from Myanmar’s western Rakhine state to neighboring Bangladesh because of the violence.  Trump aides have been working to help the Rohingya refugees leave the cramped camps, rebuild their burned-down villages and gain the full citizenship rights they have been denied for decades. In October, the administration cut off U.S. assistance for Myanmar military officials involved in operations in Rakhine, and the following month it declared the assault “ethnic cleansing.” Trump placed sanctions on a prominent Myanmar general involved in the offensive in December. And last month, Reuters revealed that a State Department team has been gathering Rohingya allegations of abuse that could be used for further sanctions and international prosecution of Myanmar officials.  “There’s a high level of interest in the administration over this,” Sam Brownback, the U.S. ambassador for international religious freedom, told The Wall Street Journal after visiting the camps in April. On Monday, Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, chastised Myanmar ally China for watering down a U.N. Security Council statement on the issue. At a refugee camp the next day, U.S. Agency for International Development chief Mark Green said the State Department will provide new policy recommendations to the president later this summer. He also announced $44 million more in U.S. humanitarian aid to feed and house the Rohingya, bringing the total to nearly $300 million.  The steps have won the Trump team uncommon praise from Congress, where parallel efforts are in the works. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), a leader on the issue who led lawmakers on a trip to the region last year, said he was encouraged by both the State Department’s use of the “ethnic cleansing” label and the tough language from Haley. “This is a massive case of horrific ethnic cleansing — and, some would say, a genocide,” Merkley told HuffPost. “It was a horrific assault on these defenseless villages and America should be in the forefront of the world’s action.” Merkley has sponsored a Senate resolution urging the “safe, dignified, voluntary and sustainable” return of the Rohingya to Myanmar. Co-sponsored by six GOP senators, it’s one of two bills on the situation that passed out of the Senate foreign relations committee this spring. The other, sponsored by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and supported by 19 other senators, makes similar demands and outlines procedures for pressuring Myanmar by placing sanctions on military officials and reducing U.S. purchases of the jade and rubies that are among its top exports. Both proposals have the support of the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber, Sen. Dick Durbin (Ill.), who went on the trip with Merkley, and are linked to parallel legislation in the House. Support from Trump for those bills could help them overcome opposition from McConnell. The Senate majority leader is a longtime supporter of Aung San Suu Kyi, the activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner who was held under house arrest by Myanmar’s military until 2010. McConnell pushed hard for her release, and for the junta to begin loosening its grip on power. Now, Suu Kyi is the most powerful civilian in the country’s government ― but she’s facing major international criticism for her failure to acknowledge the Rohingyas’ suffering or publicly challenge Myanmar’s generals. McConnell has said the U.S. should acknowledge the crisis but be wary of upending the power balance in the country. “Publicly condemning Aung San Suu Kyi — the best hope for democratic reform in Burma — is not constructive,” McConnell said in September, referring to Myanmar by its former name as U.S. officials often do. That argument has some powerful supporters within the State Department, which led an Obama-era policy of limited engagement that involved easing U.S. sanctions on the country as its military rulers made concessions like releasing Suu Kyi. The agency’s top Asia official, acting Assistant Secretary Susan Thornton, is reluctant to publicly condemn Myanmar or China for fear of reducing U.S. influence over them or weakening Suu Kyi’s position, Trump aides and congressional staffers say. Those working for the Rohingya see that thinking as outdated, given Suu Kyi’s track record in recent years.  “I’m a big supporter of Suu Kyi... all the Rohingya supported her,” said Imam Abdul Malik Mujahid, an American Muslim leader involved in lobbying around the issue. But “she has enough authority and she doesn’t do anything with it. We hope that McConnell will have a second look.”  A strong statement from the White House might acknowledge that reality and trigger faster, stronger American action. Trump has not publicly spoken about the crisis despite private commitments during his first official trip to Asia last year. Merkley believes the lack of a presidential statement creates a global perception of indifference. “If the president doesn’t know about it or, worse yet, knows about it and doesn’t care about it, either one is an enormous failing,” he said. Spokespeople for McConnell and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. The situation may soon get worse because of monsoon season, which often brings cyclones and floods. Humanitarian groups are worried about its impact on the refugee camps in Bangladesh, and the possibility that a fresh catastrophe could exacerbate budding Bengali resentment toward the refugees. Meanwhile, Myanmar’s government is dampening hopes of a peaceful return by aggressively transforming the Rohingyas’ homeland and limiting supplies of food and medicine to those Rohingya who still live in the country. It has prevented United Nations officials, rights groups and the media from freely exploring the area ― though some have snuck in to document ongoing government crackdowns, and Rohingya have been sharing accounts of arson and worsening poverty through social media.  Top congressional staff working on the issue discovered the lengths Myanmar’s leaders would go to downplay abuses during a visit this spring, an aide told HuffPost: While they flew over Rakhine state, the windows on the government plane carrying them were blacked out so they could not see burned-out Rohingya villages. That only strengthened the feeling that something needs to change fast, the aide said. Officials and activists hope Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and others close to Trump can get the issue on the president’s radar soon, whether by using upcoming State Department reports ― including one on whether the U.S. believes Myanmar’s actions constitute crimes against humanity ― or just appealing to his political instincts. Taking action on Myanmar could allow Trump to depict himself as fixing one of former President Barack Obama’s mistakes. There’s increasing public skepticism of Obama’s 2012 decision to ease sanctions on Myanmar and stay relatively quiet about the persecution of the Rohingya in hopes of facilitating a transition to democracy.  The situation offers Trump a rare chance to win international acclaim by charting a different course on foreign policy from Obama.  It’s not yet clear whether the president sees the opportunity.",Spokespeople,respond,comment

No, Ronny ― you’re trying to hold your Markotron like a pen or pencil ― just flip your wrist so your hand is upside down and backwards ― the Markotrons work fine if you just change the way you write. At recess we’ll be trying out the new game from EduGo ― did everyone sign their decline-of-liability forms? And while at your work stations, remember not to slouch so that the new DataGrabber Mining Module can track every part of your facial expressions. I’ll also remind you that part of your class requirement is to post a picture from class on Instagram or Twitter; remember, you only get credit if you use the hashtag #MrEdbrandTeaches, because every day what...? That’s right ― “Every day I’m increasing my digital footprint.” After lunch we’ll be filming the spots for the demo of EduGadget’s Gramminator ― the ones we rehearsed for the last few days ― so make sure you get your face and hair all straightened out before then. Remember ― we’re doing two versions, one with all the white kids in the front and another with all the white kids in the back. It’s so EduGadget can use them in different markets, dear. We’ll do that right after the Faberware Super Writing Center. Yes, it’s true that Miss McSpine has left the school. After that unfortunate incident with her ex-fiance, she lost most of her sponsorship deals, and the school had to let her go. Yes, I suppose she could get a job at that school on the poor side of town — the public one without any sponsors. Why don’t they have any sponsors? That’s pretty complicated, but mainly it’s just that companies aren’t interested in marketing to poor people. Which reminds me ― I’m very cross about yesterday’s video footage. We had to scrub several spots because somebody decided it would be funny to hold up a Microsoft logo in the background. Look ― someday when you’re a grown-up professional, you can develop your own personal brand, but right now, the only personal brand in this room is mine, and we are not a Microsoft classroom. Look at my teaching suit ― do you see Microsoft on here anywhere? No ― Google on the left sleeve, Apple on the right, and these other spots for our friends at McGraw Hill. Turn around? Stop giggling ― you know very well that Pearson is on my butt. Yes, I think it’s funny, too. Yes, Leah, I do look like a NASCAR driver. Oh, before we do the Pledge To Apple, I need to tell you that I drove to school today in a Lexus XLR, the preferred car of top fifth grade teachers across the valley. No, Chris, I never imagined it would be like this for me as a teacher. The New York Times (that was a newspaper ― ask your parents) wrote about teacher branding and selling out to companies years ago, but nobody knew how big it would get. Now let’s get to work. We have lots to do― I’ll be on hiatus next week for my product introduction tour in Hawaii, thanks to my friends at MegaEduTechCorp. Yes, I will miss all six of you, but I’ll see you soon. And when I come back, I’ll have lots of new products for us to try, some new curriculum units to unpack and deliver, and maybe a new car, too. What, Pat? No, I told you. We’ll start studying history when and if we find a sponsor. Boy, when people back in the day said that education would be transformed by the free market, they had no idea.

"On 22 July each year, the Christian community venerates a saint who is the single best argument for why women should be priests: Mary of Magdala, more commonly called Mary Magdalene and traditionally known as the “Apostle to the Apostles.”  Given what we know about her, it’s a scandal that some Christian communities—most notably the Roman Catholic Church and the Southern Baptist Convention—still consider women unworthy of ordination. The Roman Church’s refusal to ordain women is succinctly stated in its official Catechism:  The Southern Baptist Convention bases its refusal on several passages in the Pauline letters to Titus and Timothy that seem to disallow women from serving as pastors. (Never mind that biblical scholars agree that the letters were almost certainly not written by Paul himself.) Predictably, perhaps, the Convention adds that pastoral ministry would interfere with women’s single-minded dedication to their God-appointed “family roles.”  Such objections to the ordination of women strike rational people, including millions of Christians, as absurd. But Dominican priest Wojciech Giertych, who served as theologian of the papal household for Pope Benedict XVI, adds risibility to absurdity when he argues that women simply don’t have the mechanical know-how of men, and so would be helpless when it comes to guy-stuff like church repairs. I don’t know how handy she was with a hammer or screwdriver, but the scriptural accounts of Mary Magdalene certainly confound these arguments against women priests and pastors. Her prominence in the New Testament is indisputable. She’s presented as one of the earliest disciples of Jesus, joining his band of followers after being cleansed of “seven demons” (Mark and Luke). Although she actually isn’t the New Testament “sinner” who washed Jesus’ feet with her tears or anointed them with precious oil she’s often thought to be—this is an identification invented by Gregory the Great in the 6th century—she’s still mentioned more often in the Gospels, no fewer than 12 times, than nearly all the male apostles. The gospels of Mark, Matthew, and John recognize her as one of the women who followed Jesus to Golgotha, when all the male apostles except John had fled in terror. All four gospels also announce that she was either the very first person (Mark and John) or one of the first (Matthew and Luke), her companions also being women, to whom the Risen Christ appeared, and that she was the messenger who carried the good news to the male apostles.  Luke tells us that the other disciples didn’t believe her, either because she was a woman or because the tale was so fantastical, and ran to see the empty tomb for themselves. In the apocryphal Gospel of Mary, dating from sometime in the 2nd century, the disbelief of the male apostles, especially the brothers Andrew and Peter, is clearly rancorous. ""Did he then speak secretly with a woman, in preference to us, and not openly? Are we to turn back and all listen to her? Did he prefer her to us?"" In the later Gospel of Philip, another apocryphal text, the anger directed against Mary by the male apostles is even more intense.  These texts suggest that even at this early stage in the Church’s history, animosity toward women in leadership positions was present. But the more important point here is that both canonical and non-canonical texts affirm Mary as the witness-bearer for the risen Christ. There simply is no debate in the ancient texts about her centrality. We have nothing but legend to fall back on for the rest of Mary’s life. She isn’t mentioned in either the Acts of the Apostles or any of the New Testament epistles.  Some stories say she retired to Ephesus with Mary, Jesus’ mother, after the Resurrection. Others say that she undertook missionary work, even appearing before the Roman emperor Tiberias and astounding him with a miracle. But these legends, charming as they are, aren’t necessary for establishing her bona fides. Scripture does that. Mary Magdalene, like so many women, was one of Jesus’ earliest followers; she remained loyal to him, at great risk to herself, when the male apostles fled in doubt and terror; the Risen Christ appeared first to her; and she carried the good news to the male apostles, who refused to believe her testimony. Even John Paul II, who declared the topic of women’s ordination settled and done (a position unfortunately affirmed by Pope Francis), acknowledged that this rightly made her the Apostle to the Apostles.  So if men are qualified to ordained ministry because of the male apostles, wouldn’t Mary’s primacy over them qualify women?  The answer’s pretty clear, isn’t it? Fr.

"Ask ten American poets if poetry is dead, and seven will say it’s not, one will say it is, and two will contort themselves gymnastically trying to prove to you that the fact that poetry is dead is somehow a boon to the art-form. Ask ten non-poets living in America if poetry is dead, and it’s a clean sweep: ten of ten will tell you it’s deader than Stephen Miller’s bedroom eyes. This article is for all twenty people—as well as those who, on principle, don’t answer questionnaires. It’s for poets because contemporary American poetry has, since the early 1970s, routinized being a national disappointment. Barely a fraction of the energies endemic to poetry-as-art are now being harnessed by (we) contemporary poets, and it’d be high time for an end to that even were it not the case that poets are more or less the only people who read poetry regularly. American poetry has become a niche culture—like the ones available for players of Magic the Gathering, or self-described “Bronies,” or advocates of “furry” sex—and not the vibrant performance of endlessly differentiated artistic perspectives it should be. This means that decisions about how to write poetry are being made, both implicitly and explicitly, with an eye toward what a very narrow subculture of artists demands and will reward. The result is a betrayal of the very capacity for historic, system-challenging idiosyncrasy that makes poetry worth composing in the first place. For every game-changing book of poetry by a poet like Claudia Rankine, there are three hundred that join the freeway of American poetry publishing as indistinguishably as a Camry or Civic does I-90 in Sioux Falls. All that said, there’s little point in writing an article about the death of poetry that’s explicitly aimed at working poets because American poetry today is—besides terminally wounded—a death-cult. In installing the rigid subcultural economy so many of them frequent, American poets have entered a suicide pact that ensures their own perpetual unhappiness as well as the demise of poetry as a relevant public gesture. Indeed, in my experience so committed are poets to the rituals of their aging cult that any challenge whatsoever to its key mantras is taken as an act of betrayal—one punishable by violent expulsion from the group. In my case, that’s okay, even fortuitous; I was a member in reasonably good standing within the cult for a number of years, and I’ve largely left it now. But I’ve also found that one of the only honorable gestures one can make when one has escaped a cult that eats lives and devours the very principles it claims to elevate is to expose it for what it is as often and as publicly as one can. And since every missive filled with cult-rage sent in response to that sort of extroverted self-exorcising has already been written in my head innumerable times, there’s no reason now (detractors, please take note) to hand me the hard copy of same or “cc” me on a digital reduction. This article is therefore more vigorously intended for the non-poet because you, more than anyone, have been lied to about what poetry is—which you couldn’t have known because the people most loudly denouncing any definition for “poetry” alternative to the false one were either (a) self-avowed “poets” themselves, and thereby capable of “pulling rank” on you, or (b) educators so thoroughly tortured over the years of their own education into a false consciousness about poetry that the very least they could do was honor that generation-spanning cycle of violence by perpetuating it.  So let’s be clear: the poetry most non-poets are likely to have been exposed to in high school or college or anywhere else is to the maximum capacity of the poetic act in 2017 what the Wiggles are to the entertainment of small children.  The poetry you’ve read, that is, is either (a) poetry that was dangerously revolutionary at the time well in the past it was written, but is now presented to you as an aesthetic rather than political achievement in order to ensure it remains as alien to your contemporary aesthetic sensibilities as possible, or (b) whatever contemporary poetry was able to get through a complex subcultural system exquisitely designed to keep you permanently uninterested in poetry. So the fact is that most non-poets hate poetry about the same way I hate bluegrass: I haven’t really heard any of it, and I didn’t like what little I heard, and I didn’t give much thought at all to what I did hear, so I’ve decided not to hear any more—which seems reasonable given that there are so many things to do in life. That attitude toward poetry worked just fine during the Johnson administration—about the last time poetry could claim broader cultural relevance, due to the sometimes explosive work of the Beats, the Black Arts Movement, the San Francisco Renaissance, and the poets of the New York School—but as a nation we badly missed the vibrant poetry scene we desperately needed during the horrors of Vietnam’s final years, the Nixon resignation, the rise of the “Me Generation” under Reagan, and the thoroughly immersive horror-show of a fake hunt for WMDs in the aughts and a tinpot dictator arising from American soil in the present. Look in desperation for a Pussy Riot in poetry, or a Marina Abramović, or a Robert Mapplethorpe, or a Lenny Bruce, or even as congenial a rebel as a David Foster Wallace, and you’ll come up empty. That’s in part because you’re asking the wrong questions and looking in the wrong places for such poets and poetry—and in part because 100,000 working American poets (the largest committed poetry-writing population of any nation on earth) are doing their level best to keep you looking their way rather than any other.  (They’re failing, of course, inasmuch as, if you’re like most Americans, you’re not reading any poetry at all.) So below are ten ideas that could save American poetry. The list is obviously non-exhaustive, and these ideas do not comprise a prescription for poetry-writing. It’s consistent with American poetry’s radical birth in the First Amendment that every poet should write however they damn well please, and that different people come to poetry for very different things. What these ideas are, however, is a confession, by a longtime poet, that while not many poets need to be integrating these ideas into their poetry-writing practice, and not many non-poets need to re-dedicate themselves to reading poetry and poets undergirded by the principles below, at least some do if poetry is going to survive much further into the digital age. In short, America, poetry needs you in a much more obvious way than you need poetry. Fortunately, the poetry that needs you the most, and which, in turn, non-poets most need whether they realize it or not, is not the poetry that many poets are now writing or the poetry that non-poets are currently not reading. Instead, it’s an entirely different and in certain respects particularly American beast that deserves your attention as much now as the Ramones did in the 1970s. And it’s just about as good for you. NOTE: Every video in this article is poetry. Note also that while some of these ideas are ones I’ve developed, others have been in development for a very long while by a great many people who are not me. The point is not that a person—me or anyone else—can individually do anything to rescue poetry from a poetry subculture that daily celebrates falseness, cruelness, smallness, and exclusion, but that the same subculture that is now systematically strangling poetic innovation on occasion produces the tools of its own dismantling. If there is a good thing to be said about contemporary American poetry, it is that it is not yet so disconnected from its own distress that it cannot provide clues to those on the lookout for a course correction. So here’s a start in that direction, at least: 1. Poetry is not a genre of art. What poetry is is a “meta-genre,” meaning that it’s a concept you find—and already enjoy—in innumerable genres of art you love and regularly consume. The most succinct definition of poetry I’ve come across holds that a poem is a “reflexive language system,” which means, taking those three words in reverse order, that it’s (a) a phenomenon that exhibits signs of a formal structure, (b) expressed in any mode of communication that qualifies as a “language” (including oral, written, visual, nonverbal, experiential, multimedia, transmedia, augmented-virtuality, augmented-reality, and virtual-reality modes of communication), which also (c) shows signs of self-awareness that it is (i) communicative and (ii) has form.  Still shorter: any form of communication self-consciously informed by a philosophy of communication (what we call a “poetics”) can be poetry.  Shortest: poetry is an idiosyncratic literacy operating on a common language. What this means is that any comedian worth remembering after they’re dead—Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, Richard Pryor, or Robin Williams, for instance—was probably using the meta-genre we know as “poetry” to create an unforgettable series of performances whose attitude toward language was complex, internally coherent, and worthy of long-term recall and study. The same is true of every musician who pioneers a genre, whether it’s Gil Scott-Heron and rap, The Monks and punk, Roky Erickson and psychedelia, or diverse trailblazing figures from John Cage to Joanna Newsom, Charlie Parker to Sturgill Simpson.  Simple fact: if you’re artist and you don’t have a “poetics”—an idiosyncratic philosophy, arising from the sum of your interests and knowledge and experience, about the purpose of communication—your work won’t just be forgotten when you die but will be forgotten while you’re still alive. 2. Don’t feel obligated to connect with any poetry that’s not as meaningful to you as your favorite music, comedy, cinema, or visual art is. Somewhere along the way poetry got separated out from all the other art-forms in a very particular way: it became all right to say “I like poetry” or “I don’t like poetry”—everyone would know what you meant—when you’d sound ridiculous if you were to say, “I don’t like any music” or “I don’t like any movies” or “I never laugh at comedians.”  The truth is, when it comes to art we all like about 5% of what’s out there. If you could sit down and hear every band that ever cut a track, or watch every film ever made, or listen to every stand-up comedian who ever booked a gig in a two-bit basement bar, you’d have no interest in 95% of it and find the rest thoroughly engaging.  Poetry is the same way, inasmuch as I can tell you now that, whoever you are, at least 95% of poetry isn’t for you and shouldn’t be. And your dislike of it no more means you “don’t like poetry” than disliking Garth Brooks means you don’t like any music. But all that said, I bet I could find some poetry you dig. The key difference between music and cinema and stand-up comedy—art-forms which increasingly are not “managed,” meaning you can access the full range of performances they have to offer with little or no difficulty—is that poetry is beholden to a system that distributes a narrow band of the art-form to American audiences. Our high schools, our colleges, and even many of our local reading series are a devious form of “managed care” inasmuch as they take care of poetry’s legacy by imposing atop it a massive, labyrinthine subcultural bureaucracy under whose ministrations the patient has died unnecessarily.  The upshot: hold poetry to the same standard you do any other art-form, but also militate, alongside me and many others, for poetry to unlock its doors so that you can experience its range (and so its poets can be encouraged to produce and expand that range) in the same way every other American art-form now permits. 3. Poets are charged more than any other type of artist with torching language and all its conventions. There’s a reason that, throughout history, poets have been among the first targeted for death in every autocratic power-grab, though you’ll find almost no evidence of that history in the interviews American poets give about poetry. If you’ve ever read or listened to an interview with an American poet—and you probably haven’t; even most poets haven’t when they say they have—you’ll hear a lot of saccharine talk about how poetry either (a) preserves language and memory and the sensory elements of communication beneath a beautiful bell jar (perhaps like the one in Disney’s Beauty and the Beast), or (b) uses language in some other esoteric way certain to have a dramatic impact on the life and sensibilities of no one but the poet.  Along with either one of these two lines of reasoning you’ll hear a lot of wild claims about the power of poetry that no poem you’ve ever read has substantiated. You will suspect, rightly, that what many poets see in poetry is simply a mirror-image of what they need from poetry—psychologically, emotionally, and/or socially—not what poetry is likely to be to anyone else who does not harbor those specific needs. But there are poets out there who take a different view, who say that having a “poetics” means trying to create either an entirely new System of the World or firebomb (metaphorically) the existing one with the same manic energy you’d find at a death-metal concert.  The first exertions of an autocratic or revolutionary cultural pulse are always felt in language, and as any poet’s core milieu is language—sometimes accompanied by music, sometimes by the moving images of a film, sometimes performed on a stage with comic timing—a poet’s most profound palette is always power itself. The poet contests the world with language; while it’s equally true that the poet constructs new worlds with language, for too long in American poetry the contestations found in poems have been excessively coded ones and the constructions it enables about as private as Trump’s Mar-a-Lago.  My point is that as and when you find yourself looking for examples of humans using language to decimate the chains that bind them, you are in search of poetry. And when you find the reflexive language system you’re looking for—the human communication that knows exactly how and why and where it must exist—you may find it in music, in a political speech, in the cinema, or anywhere else fellow homo sapiens are battling death and eternity. 4. Poetry is more forgiving of “error” and more celebratory toward what makes you a weirdo than anything else because it’s worthless. Music, stand-up comedy, cinema, political speech-making—all have boundaries and standards of “taste” applied to them because all are commercially viable. For the “badness” of a film, say, to be celebrated, the badness must not just be extraordinary but something to be held up to the smugness of our collective scorn—as is the case with Tommy Wiseau’s The Room.  Music does a bit better—the reflexive disposability of glam-rock (a poetics) and the celebration of amateur musicianship we sometimes find in punk (also a poetics) acknowledge “badness” as a necessary component of communication—but then we find, in political speech-making, that there is a right way and a wrong way to do it, and the wrong way is near-universally derided. (This is one reason why, for all that nearly every aspect of his character and his political agenda is odious, Donald Trump should be celebrated by those with the hearts of poets for just one thing: his ability to subvert the mechanics of political speech-making. Trump, out of folly rather than genius, has reshaped, for instance, at what grade-level a political speech can be written, how often a word—particularly an empty platitude or verbal tic—can be repeated, and what sort of body language or voice inflection is eligible for the adjective “presidential.” We might not like the result, but we can still agree that there should be more ways to rouse a crowd in American politics than just the one. Incidentally, Bernie Sanders also found a new language in which to encode a politics, which is why he too struck an unlikely chord this last election season).  Note that in calling a poem a “reflexive language system” we do not say it has to be marketable, that it has to please many people, or even that it need be pleasing in its form, mode of communication, or concept—merely that it have a form, a communicative capability, and a concept. A poem that makes you enraged, that makes you laugh, that befuddles you, that leaves you markedly cold, or that makes you join a political revolution like the one now forming in opposition to Donald Trump is no less a poem because it doesn’t offer slick production values or doesn’t appeal to your personal tastes. Poems can revel in sloppiness, in “badness,” in their schlocky fidelity to how we actually live, think, speak, feel, fear, love, and see. The idea that poetry must be an elevation of language above the mire of existence is a falsehood perpetuated by literary propagandists. But part of this idea—the idea that poetry’s dodgy economics are a benefit to it, not a hindrance—is the idea that poets have to start fighting more vigorously for this ethos to invade poetry produced in the academy as well.  Since 1993, creative writing has grown faster in terms of terminal-degree program creation than any other discipline, but we don’t see the markers of that success in such programs’ funding packages. Too many young poets are kept from accessing the time and space to write that a writing program offers by an inability to afford the bill. And it is an actual evil—I use that word, evil, advisedly—that many of the powers that be in American poetry have worked so hard to ensure that graduate creative writing programs will never become the fully funded terminal-degree programs they should be. So treating the economics of poetry as a surprising asset for the art-form also means eliminating any barriers to that maxim being universal rather than just local.  In America today we have an opportunity for our creative writing MFA programs to be fully funded in the same way terminal-degree programs in all other academic disciplines are, and to the extent certain poets stand in the way of that progress they should be swept aside as enemies of not just art but the real lives of real people. (Note that I don’t include in this rhetoric those who work in programs that are not fully funded and are doing their level best to change the economic superstructure of their writing program.) The same can be said of any poet—and there are many today in this group, including many atop poetry’s subcultural hierarchy—who consider themselves entitled to decide who should or should not be writing poetry or what a poet can or cannot write. Poetry, however idiosyncratically defined and located, should be everyone’s pursuit, and to narrow the path toward it, whatever one’s self-righteous reasons for doing so, is as much an actual evil as is putting it out of reach of the poor. Poetry must be ever mindful, in particular, of opening its doors still wider to the shy, the Middle American, and the suffering—whether those suffering persons are straight and white and male or members of a minority population. 5. A poet knows better than anyone that words are just words. A poet can celebrate how much a single word is worth—can show us how just three words (say liberty, equality, and fraternity, or we the people) can move an entire nation to action—but knows too what comedians have long known, which is that language is endlessly malleable, fungible, ephemeral, and combinatory.  A poet can treat words like a jazz musician treats notes—as an opportunity for improvisation (a comment on form which is, of course, its own formal structure)—or like Girl Talk treats samples. That’s right: literary remixing is a thing, and is poetry. You can remix other people’s poems, or your own Facebook feed, or someone else’s Facebook feed, or the words on the back of a cereal box. You can also appropriate—or misappropriate—language as part of a poetics, such as turning a Donald Trump speech into poetry or falsely attributing a series of lyric monologues to a dead person. You can explode linguistic taboos and expose their innards. You can loop an unscripted Chat Roulette session into the middle of a poem that performs the experience of reading the internet, as I once saw the poet Jesse Damiani do at a reading in Oxford, Mississippi, or turn the Nirvana album Nevermind into an epic book of poetry with one line of Cobain’s lyrics per page, as has also been done recently.  You can do whatever the hell you want in/as poetry, provided it is done reflexively—that is, mindfully, and with consideration of form and concept—and provided it generates something more than a private (i.e., non-communicative) language system. Words are material, and so they act, and can be acted upon, just like any other material: they can break, explode, recombine, be poorly made, be dropped into the same space over and over, and so on. They can also generatively displease us, moving us to action or new philosophies by dint of their provocations. 6. Poetry is not just the best but perhaps the only way to authentically “perform” your life. I said poetry is a meta-genre, and it is, but of course this also means that, when we find it, we can identify its operations independent of any accompaniment. Miles Davis could make poetry with a trumpet, and Jimi Hendrix with a guitar, and Robert Mapplethorpe with a camera, but while we always carry our ability to make words with us, we do not always have a trumpet, guitar, or camera at hand.   Poetry, in other words, doesn’t come from the trumpet, or the guitar, or the camera, but from a series of competencies and knowledge bases that (say) Davis, Hendrix, and Mapplethorpe had been deriving all their lives from their experiences and their psyches. Poets ought to stop advertising poetry as an instrument for constructing something entirely different from the world we all live in, when what most of us need or would ever want to come to art for is to perform our lives as we live them. That is, in our words, our ideas, the sounds of our life, and the spaces in which we move.  Davis’ plan for performing “So What” (see above), or Moondog’s relationship with the constituent sounds that make up his slice-of-life self-titled album (see below), would be where the poetry is even if neither Davis nor Moondog had ever cut an album. In my own life, I find that much of what I say and do is built upon the invisible foundation of what the people I care about and admire have said and done to me in the past, so I sometimes write poems in which I combine my language with the language of those other people without distinguishing between what I “wrote” and what others have said. Why? Because what I am—all I am—is a superficially seamless combination of those two categories of language, and so I use poetry to perform that fact.  In music, it takes John Cage’s extraordinary composition 4’33”—which is just four minutes and thirty-three seconds of silence, forcing the listener to hear the sounds of her own life (e.g., breathing, others’ coughing)—to make a similar point. Meanwhile, in poetry I (or anyone) can replicate that idea in innumerable ways whenever I feel like it. No trumpet, guitar, camera, or other instrument besides my own knowledge of my life is necessary, as I always carry my words and the sounds of my life and the relationship I develop between and among these things wherever I go. There’s a reason poetry is one of the oldest art-forms: it’s something you can create alone and without possessions on a deserted island, or when your village and all its resources have been destroyed, or when you’re so stricken by fear or sadness or anger that you can’t lift your head up or reach for anything solid. And as noted already, it animates even those arts in which the words “sonnet” and “stanza” have no meaning. 7. No other type of artist needs years of groupthink-oriented, aesthetically essentialist “workshopping” to become what they need to be, and neither do poets—so the contemporary poetry “workshop” can safely be detonated. In the conventional poetry workshop, (a) printed poetry written in the then-period style is consumed by students, (b) little emphasis is put on how poems are performed and how the certainty of future performance can inform the writing of a work, (c) students are given identical reading assignments rather than helped to find the poetry they personally would benefit most from encountering, (d) poetry is treated as an aesthetic artifact rather than a meta-genre, meaning that students discuss it as though it were a means of self-expression with ingrained rules and methods and modes for self-determining its own value, and (e) classes are run with an eye toward the deductive reasoning needed to “fix” a single student’s work, rather than as celebrations of the inductive philosophical discussions of “poetics” that using student work as a jumping-off point can deliver.  Why are workshops run this way? Because it’s easiest for the instructor, who is probably a working poet themselves with other things on their mind—like their own writing—rather than helping to guide ten to twelve emotionally volatile younger poets on their ten to twelve incredibly complex, idiosyncratic journeys of artistic discovery. The conventional workshop is also less scary for such a teacher-poet, who’s likely (like most poets) an introvert, as it operates under a series of common assumptions about the purpose of the class, the structure of the pedagogy, and the general outline of a “good” poem that are knowable in advance. It takes faith in how poetry provokes novel considerations of language to permit students to pursue wide-ranging, wholly exploratory conversations—conversations in which student work is a dialogic catalyst rather than a fetish.  The good news: the contemporary workshop is actually an idea stolen from the late 1880s, when it was used at Harvard to teach advanced composition courses. That means the poetry “workshop” as we know it today was never intended for use in the discipline of creative writing, and is in no way suitable to or tailored to that endeavor. We can dump it or simply reinvent it right now without doing any harm to anyone. A redesigned workshop would center idiosyncrasy, poetics, error, exploration, performance, collaboration, multimedia, getting outside the classroom, and much else that has only a very limited place in contemporary creative writing pedagogy. 8. Poetry is something you chase, not something you do. To be a poet is to chase whatever “poetry” is through the channels of time, and since those channels of time are multifaceted and variously bent or straightened by things like technology and politics we can be certain that poetry is changing as time slides on. The gatekeepers of what poetry is or can be, or what a poet is or can be, are not very happy about the internet because acknowledging the internet means that poetry can’t ever again be what it once was. No more than sculpture can be for us now what it was for Michelangelo, given that unlike Michelangelo we have 3D printing, augmented- and virtual-reality modeling, and sufficient cultural bandwith to create “experiential art” in which the sculpture conforms to the contours of the user’s life rather than vice versa (see Meow Wolf for an example).  When radio changed poetry, that was registered in Ezra Pound’s Cantos, which was celebrated in its time if not as much as it would be after Pound’s death; in many respects, television entered printed-page poetry with the documentary, peripatetic poetics of The New York School; today, poets are struggling to accommodate the internet because it feels technocratic rather than bohemian, is too large and invasive a sea change in human culture to readily grasp, and is much harder to market in the book-publishing milieu that American poetry’s rigid subculture still idolizes. When I say that one “chases” poetry, I mean that the role of the poet is as much to determine where poetry is headed and to inhabit and explore that space as it is to perform (or, more commonly, to perform over and over again) what poetry was in some past moment. Poetry became a knowledge base—a skill-set teachable in the academy—in part to justify its positioning in the academy, not because poetry-as-art is static and knowable. In fact, poetry exists now, and is being permanently inflected now, in the technologies of tomorrow (e.g., advanced biomodification, nanotechnology, cryptocurrencies, haptic VR tech) even as poets are regularly publishing work that wouldn’t have been out of place in the 1950s. But that’s where poetry was; we should neither celebrate nor hold up as the Platonic “poet” one who is simply able to reproduce a form first perfected over a half-century ago. Being a poet is, in this respect, as much about a spirit of adventure, critical and creative thinking skills, and a high degree of self-knowledge (up to a “poetics”) as it is about distinguishing between a couplet and a quatrain. 9. The fact that nobody will buy, read, teach, or enjoy your poetry means that it’s the one thing that is totally yours. A little-known secret—even poets hush it up—is that the average book of poetry sells about 50 copies, mostly to the family and intimate friends of the poet, and even a top-selling poetry book (say, the top 1% of books of poetry published each year) sells about 1,500 to 2,000 copies, which means that it’s owned by 1.5% to 2% of the more than 100,000 working poets in the United States. Now how many of those who own these top-selling poetry books actually read them cover to cover? Unknown. Probably less than half. How many of that half deeply enjoy what they read? Probably a quarter. And how many of that quarter are (a) teachers of poetry and (b) would teach a given book of poetry to others even where the poet is not a personal friend of theirs? Maybe one-tenth. And how many who ever read that book will not only read it cover-to-cover and enjoy it immensely, but also remember it for even a year? Maybe one in a hundred, and even then it’s most likely to be the author’s best friend or his mother. But it’s still more likely, if you’re a poet, that your best friend secretly dislikes your poetry and your mother wishes you’d done something more “productive.” What I’m saying is that American poets have found innumerable ways to hide from themselves that no one’s listening: for instance, by habitually attending an annual literary conference that seems packed and therefore makes poetry seem vibrant; by never revealing to anyone their own books’ sales figures, and by frequenting publishing houses that pull the same sleight-of-hand; by pretending that having read one poem by a poet is the same as having “read the poet,” and thereby pretending to a broader knowledge of the poetry scene than any poet actually has; by fooling ourselves into the belief that when our friends or family “like” our poetry it means anything more than that our friends and family like us. But what if we took the opposite view? What if poetry became widely understood to be the only artifact you can possibly make that is potentially history-altering for others both holds every bit of its value so long as it channels everything you are? What if poetry, whether on its own or accompanied by guitars or translated through a camera, is the only thing humans really know how to make before they die that freezes in time what it was like for them to be alive? What if the old adage that says the only way to make a blank piece of paper less valuable is to write a poem on it also means that what a poem can be is not restricted by economics, culture, or the psychosocial? 10. If poets for once steal a page from a group of seeming adversaries—professional writers—they’ll start to save poetry by habit rather than design. When I teach professional writing, I often contrast it to self-conscious (often a euphemism for “self-expressive”) writing in this way: I note that a “professional writer” thinks first and perhaps almost exclusively about the experience his or her audience is having. The problem, of course, is that this sort of ethos, necessary as it is for professional and technical writing, has always been thought of as the death-knell for imaginative writing. After all, if one’s audience is in the driver seat, able to demand from the writer that specific forms and conventions be met before a document is published, whither the “poetics” of the author?  In fact, the delirious glory of having a poetics is that not only is it definitionally a relationship with language and culture and identity—and a theory of same—that’s entirely unique to a given author, it’s also a near certainty that the more authentically idiosyncratic a poetics is, the better performed it will be by the author and the more mesmerizing it will be for its audience.  No poem is worse than the one that was written to someone else’s design—that’s true—but it’s equally true that no poem is less likely to be effective for a prospective audience (which has undoubtedly, in that scenario, heard a thousand such poems before). My point is that many poets loathe the idea of developing an idiosyncratic poetics because they fear it will alienate their audience; they’re fooling themselves, however, as in fact developing an idiosyncratic poetics is the only thing they can do that will allow them to discover an audience for the long-term.  A poetry informed by a poetics finds its proper audience over time. This is especially true if we imagine poets wanting to reach a non-poetry-writing audience. Much like musicians don’t want to sing only for other musicians, or painters paint for other painters, poets who wish to be read by non-poets need to be less, rather than more, constricted by what other poets consider appropriate and artful. Poets should begin demanding of themselves work that could not possibly have been created by anyone else—work that is thoroughly (in form, content, concept, performance, and sensory contours) of and by them rather than anyone else. Poets and non-poets should demand this, too, of all the poetry they read, which may require shutting up a bit about the work of one’s friends and asking them to do the same for you (if you’re a poet). Only a poetry economy in which we celebrate that which delights us—not considering its author—is one in which we perpetually send the message that thinking about audience is okay, being idiosyncratic is okay, torching language and communicative conventions in the way singer-songwriters and comedians and screenwriters do is okay. What needs to be maintained in poetry, and what is threatened by poetry’s present provincial subculture—including the conventional writing workshop, the mob mentality of poet communities on social media, the cliquishness of cosmopolitan poetry enclaves, and the narrowness and inherent dishonesty of poetry’s publishing sphere—is the key element of surprise. While we should always seek delight in poetry, so too should we feel a poem to be a bracing wind that unsettles even as it inspires. Many of these ideas may seem internally contradictory, such as saying that poetry can move nations even as it perfectly performs the idiosyncrasies of the self, but in fact this is merely the “meta-meta-genre” quality of poetry that makes poetry even more awe-inspiring a human construct than I’ve averred here.  In other words, our definition(s) of poetry have, themselves, a poetics. Poetry is, after all, a system of seemingly contradictory ideas which, taken together, make the composition of poetry possible. Poetry would not be as rich as it is, or as resilient as it is, if its central character was purely political or, alternatively, purely personal. If it could not be disseminated via a market it would lose its cultural capital—or, its potential cultural capital—and that remains true even as we note that poetry fruitfully resides beyond economics. Creative writing pedagogy is crucial because it brings people together to wrestle with the question of what poetry can be, even as our current national pedagogy is harmful and ought to be discarded post-haste. Poetry is changed fundamentally by the fact that, like us, it moves through and is changed by the fourth dimension of time, but this doesn’t touch the fact that many a young poet was moved to chase poetry’s ever-retreating form by reading Walt Whitman as a child. Poetry is animated by Life, but often must traffic in destruction and reconstruction to do the difficult work of constantly refreshing what it means to be alive. And finally, as much as it may seem an act of prestidigitation, redefining what poetry is to view it as a meta-genre—present in the best music, cinema, comedy, and visual art—can be an essential act of resistance and redefinition even for those poets committed to poetry as an artifact for the printed page. So, is poetry dead? Yes. Did poets kill it? Yes. Is the thing that died the thing poetry is now? No. Which frees us to go in search of it. And what we find when we do, particularly in congregations of aspiring poets both in and out of the academy, is that the ideas above draw into the ambit of poetry many who currently do not—but should—consider themselves “poets,” such as pioneers in music, VR technology, and performance art. We find also, as educators and as those hoping to encourage aspiring poets in whatever setting, that young men and women who come to poetry to produce the conventional forms of expression we associate with it—that is, printed, lyrically self-aware writings—benefit enormously from seeing their palette of options expanded, as to both a poetics and the execution of a poetics, to include the principles enumerated above. Any fear that poetry as poets understand it now will be lost in the contemplation of poetry as it really is and can be sorely underestimate the resilience and flexibility of even “conventional” poetic expressions (and convention-oriented authors as well).  As is the case with so many other human endeavors, poetry ceases to be brittle when the discussion of it ceases to be brittle. The same goes for politics, culture, and self-identity in an age of such entrenched inter-human divisions. Poetry is a path we can choose to take, and that many more of us than currently do should opt to explore, as the best means yet devised to move up and out and away from darkness.

By  Lisa O'Donoghue-Lindy, Managing Editor, SJWEH This article was originally featured on career2.0blog.net, an inspirational blog about women in professional transition. Freshly laid off from my job of 19 years as a TV producer, I was the perfect candidate for Oprah's The Life You Want Weekend. I was canned from my job August 7 while on vacation so I decided to say yes to every opportunity and reconnect with old colleagues and friends while on sabbatical. By chance, I met my old friend Julie with whom I worked 15 years ago. We used to watch Oprah at 4pm each day at work. We looked important because we worked in TV and had headphones on so people thought we were actually working. So Julie and I went for a walk, and at the end of the walk she mentioned she had an extra ticket to the Oprah odyssey and I of course jumped at the chance to go. I then went home and furiously plotted, begged, borrowed, and stole Saturday carpools to be able to be present on Friday night and all day Saturday at the Oprahpalooza! So Julie and I (Julie 2.0) met up Friday night at the workshop. Little did I know she had third row seats on the floor of the Verizon Center. I could spit on Oprah. And yes she is the happy, heavier Oprah we all know and love. Of course I have watched too many Oprah shows and immediately when I sat down I felt underneath my chair for the keys to a new car. Sadly they were not there. So now it is Friday night at the Verizon Center and I'm waiting for Oprah to inspire me. She rose out of the stage a few feet away and joked that, while she could not sing or dance, almost the entire Verizon center was sold out to hear her speak on a Friday night. Mostly women, skewing on the more African American scale but not by much, multi-generational women there to be inspired on what they should do with their lives. We held hands, danced together, and laughed. So much estrogen wanting to know how to be guided and to find our dream job. Oprah lesson one is that ""the universe delivers what you put out there"". So basic yet true! If you are positive, positive things will come back to you. This message is followed by ""you cannot manage other folks"". So do not go there, wasted energy, focus only on yourself. Finally ""you co-create your life, so manage it as you want to live it"". It sounds corny now but we had these bracelets on that lit up in colors that correlated to the mood you were feeling. She inspired us all, made us laugh- she is really quite funny - and we all loved the night. I felt like Oprah was my BFF, my sister. I held hands with strangers next to me. Her final takeaway that night was an intimate moment she shared about her grandmother who raised her. As her grandmother got older she explained that one day she hoped Oprah would be as lucky as she was and work for nice white folks. This family was kind to her grandma with money, and donated clothes and food and only hoped Oprah could have the same thing. Oprah rounded out the night thanking us all for being her white folks. So very powerful, we all left on a high! I had an epiphany during her talk that life is too short to be unhappy. I was inspired enough when I got home I told my husband, Mark, he should quit his job on Monday. Thanks Oprah! Oops, now we are both unemployed. I'm back in my chair on Saturday morning by 8 am. This is the day we are rolling up our sleeves and figuring out the life we want. Oprah strolls out on stage right in front of me wearing jeans and a blue sweater and glasses and is ready to be the teacher. We have worksheets to finish the day and she is going to moderate us through the exercises. So we begin by picturing someone we love and writing down what we wish they would do to succeed and be happy. Of course I pick my husband, who hates his job, and proceed to cry like a baby as I write down what I want for him. The cameras filming the event seize on me and I continue to cry outright; thankfully Julie ignores my very blatant tears and slides a tissue my way. It being all women in the crowd mostly, Oprah explains eventually we need to do the same exercise for ourselves. Women never do that for themselves. We fill out a pie chart on how we rank our lives--I spaced out and fill out 75% of mine to include family and friends and then pencil the other areas in like job, health, hobbies, spirituality, financial situation and the contribution to the world, and they all only get a teeny piece of the pie because hey that is the truth of a mom with 4 kids! I clearly need to start balancing out the pie with a few more slices for me. Then Oprah fills hers out on the big techno screen and she only rates her job a small portion of her pie chart. Shocking considering she had her own talk show for 25 years and owns her own TV network. But Oprah's financial situation pie slice had a gazillion smileys--mine had two. Saturday continued with inspired talks from Liz Gilbert, author ofEat, Pray, Lovewho encouraged everyone to find their inner quest. We all have that dream dormant or ready to conquest. Now that I am unemployed - as will be my husband Mark come October 3 thanks to Oprah - we are so very tempted to take a memorable trip but we have a high school teenager too. So sadly it will not happen. I think the most inspirational speaker for me during the two days was a young pastor named Rob Bell, a hip 30-something man with a gift for story telling without the religious connotations. His message was what a miracle it is to be alive and have a conscientious choice. In the end, none of us know our 2.0 and are just trying to figure it out. I change my plan every day. Oprah says everyone of us is looking for the same thing - we want to know we matter! And everyone has a story to tell, I just may not know mine yet. Thanks for reading oh and yikes I have a job interview this coming week. Game on Oprah!",we,is,life
"Day after day, CNN’s team of political journalists have set up cameras on the same public road to catch glimpses of President Donald Trump hitting the links at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. But on Wednesday, a white box truck parked right in front of those cameras and blocked the news organization’s view. While the Secret Service denied that the truck was intentionally placed to obstruct views of Trump, CNN’s Dan Merica pointed out the significance of the vehicle’s placement. ″The president and the White House have tried to obscure the fact that President Trump golfs on a regular basis,” Merica said. “This is a man who ran for president, who criticized President Barack Obama regularly for playing golf during his presidency, but that criticism hasn’t continued into the Trump presidency.” Trump’s latest outing marked the 87th time he has visited one of his golf properties since taking office. It was also his 112th day staying at a Trump-owned property during his presidency, NBC News reported. The most recent rounds of golf occurred soon after Trump tweeted that he was getting “back to work” after the Christmas holiday.  I hope everyone is having a great Christmas, then tomorrow it’s back to work in order to Make America Great Again (which is happening faster than anyone anticipated)! According to pool reports, Trump arrived at his West Palm Beach golf course at 9 a.m. on both Tuesday and Wednesday. The White House would not say if the president was actually playing golf. President Trump has arrived at the Trump International golf course, per pool. WH won’t say if he’s golfing. Check out CNN’s full description of the truck in the video below.",he,occurred,holiday
"Republicans like to accuse Democrats of trying to “pick winners and losers.” They say we should run government  “like a business” and let “the market” decide important matters. When it comes to the declining fortunes of dirty fuels like coal, however, they quickly they abandon these principles. Case in point: the Southern Company’s new power plant in Kemper County, Mississippi. The plant was supposed to prove one of the dirty fuel industry’s most cherished myths: the idea that technology can make coal “clean” and environmentally acceptable. Some $7.5 billion later, the company has abandoned the coal project. Equipment designed to reduce coal emissions never worked. The plant is $4 billion over budget and three years behind schedule. Shareholders have lost $3 billion and customers are stuck paying $840 million in recovery costs. The hype evaporated into thin air and “clean coal” remains a political illusion with no grounding in reality. But don’t expect the dirty fuel industry to scorn coal the way it did solar power after one company, Solyndra, went bankrupt in 2011. Solyndra’s failure became the dirty fuel industry’s favorite anecdote. They dishonestly used the bankruptcy of a single manufacturer to smear a successful loan program and predict the demise of clean energy. They were wrong. Five years later, solar is booming. The amount of solar energy capacity installed in the United States in 2016 was a 95 percent increase over the previous year. Solar power now ranks as the No. 1 source of new electricity generation capacity in the country. The massive growth of solar is creating tons of jobs. Last year, solar industry jobs grew 17 times faster than the rest of the U.S. economy, and the solar industry “now employs more people than oil, coal, and gas combined” for electricity generation, according to Business Insider. That’s not even counting wind power, which is the cheapest source of new electricity on the planet (followed closely by solar). And the benefits of these cheap and clean energy sources extend far beyond California’s cradle of innovation. Conservative states like Iowa, Kansas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Texas have become national leaders in wind energy. According to the New York Times, the leaders of these states “see tapping the wind, and to a lesser degree the sun, as an economic strategy. The clean energy push allows their utilities to lock in low power prices for decades, creates manufacturing jobs, puts steady money in the hands of farmers who host wind turbines and lures big employers who want renewable power.” Renewable energy is a clear winner when it comes to boosting the economy and creating jobs. It’s growing, it’s innovating, and more than 800,000 Americans now work in renewable energy jobs. Major corporations like Apple, Microsoft, Google and Costco have all pledged to go 100 percent clean. Contrast this with coal, which indisputably is in steep decline. The American economy is quickly exiting the coal era, with cleaner energy replacing coal even in the heart of coal country. West Virginia’s Appalachian Power company has closed three coal plants in recent years. And if there’s an anecdote that symbolizes the plight of coal in 2017, it’s this: in a “cost-saving move,” the Kentucky Coal Museum just added 80 solar panels to its roof. The decline of coal means there are fewer and fewer jobs for miners. As the Washington Post pointed out earlier this year, more people work at Arby’s than work in the entire coal industry. Despite the frequent use of coal miners as a potent political symbol, coal jobs are disappearing ― and they’re not coming back. What remains of the coal industry is quickly being automated, with robots replacing miners to cut costs. Meanwhile, Mitch McConnell and Republicans do their best to crush workers by opposing organized labor and refusing to plan for a future in which these workers will need to be retrained for new industries. But not even the robots can save coal. It’s simply too expensive and too dirty to compete. It’s bad business, plain and simple. This is tough news for those Americans who work in the coal industry, and all of us should care about what happens to them. Ideally, they can be retrained for positions in thriving new industries... like clean energy. What is the Trump Administration’s response to the reality of coal’s decline? Energy Secretary Rick Perry is flirting with the idea of government intervention to prop up the industry, requiring states to use coal and nuclear power for completely ill-defined “national security” reasons. For people who claim to support states’ rights and the free market, this is the height of hypocrisy and delusion. The same people who say the government shouldn’t pick winners and losers want government to turn a loser into a winner. When Republicans say they want to run government “like a business,” they apparently mean “run government like a Trump casino headed straight for bankruptcy court.” It won’t work. Clean energy is the future, and it’s the only smart bet for business. Protip: Sell all your fossil fuel stocks.",They,used,energy
"HOUSTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The Houston Astros escaped a thrilling home-run filled clash with a 13-12 extra-innings victory against Los Angeles Dodgers on Sunday to be one win away from their maiden World Series title. After blowing a three-run lead in the ninth inning during which they had the Dodgers down to their final strike, Houston closed out one of the wildest games in World Series history when Alex Bregman hit a walk-off single in the 10th inning. “Back and forth, the two best teams in baseball fighting to the very end and going toe to toe with each other,” Bregman told reporters. “Everybody was used on both teams, pretty much, every single player. It was special for us to come out on top.” What were you doing at 23? @ABREG_1 is doing THIS. #WorldSeries pic.twitter.com/FS3u4XxTJw Each team had their left-handed aces on the mound to start the pivotal fifth game of the best-of-seven series but both the Dodgers’ Clayton Kershaw and Astros’ Dallas Keuchel failed to produce the pitchers’ duel many had expected. By the time the final out was recorded in a game that had it all and kept the capacity crowd on their feet most of the way, the Dodgers and Astros had combined for a whopping seven home runs, including a trio of three-run blasts. The Astros, who lead the series 3-2, now have two chances in Los Angeles to win their first World Series championship since the inception of the franchise 55 years ago. “We knew going into this series, this is the best offensive ballclub that we were going to see all year. And they can slug you. They spoil pitches. They’re athletic. And credit to them,” said Dodges manager Dave Roberts. “But our guys did the same thing. They just got the hit when they needed.” After rallying back from four, three and one-run deficits, Houston finally pulled in front when Jose Altuve’s run-scoring double made it 9-8 just two batters after George Springer tied the game with a solo shot. Carlos Correa’s two-run homer before the inning was over stretched the Astros lead to three but Dodgers shortstop Corey Seager doubled in a run in the top of the eighth to pull his team to within 11-9. That. Just. Happened. #WorldSeries pic.twitter.com/go9TqpX5fI On a night when no lead was safe, the Astros fans remained a tense bunch even after Brian McCann’s eighth-inning homer gave the Astros their biggest lead of the night, 12-9. But the drama was only getting started as the Dodgers stormed back in the ninth compliments of Yasiel Puig’s two-run shot and a run-scoring single from Chris Taylor before sending it to extra innings. Kershaw, who enjoyed a pitching masterclass in the series opener, was locked in early but the wheels came off and by the time he left the game had allowed six runs and four hits with two strikeouts and three walks over 4-2/3 innings. Keuchel also had a rough night as he loaded the bases in the first before a Logan Forsythe single scored a pair. The Dodgers added another before the frame was done and Keuchel left the game after allowing four runs on five hits through 3-2/3 innings. “It’s hard to put into words all the twists and turns in that game, the emotion, doing it at home, in front of our home crowd,” said Astros manager A.J. Hinch. “Just exactly what you expect to come to the park with Keuchel and Kershaw pitching. Just a perfect setup game for a bunch of runs,” he added jokingly. Houston, we have a win! #EarnHistory #WorldSeries pic.twitter.com/Ni0FoebOsE Game Six is scheduled for Tuesday in Los Angeles where the Dodgers will send Rich Hill to the mound while the Astros will counter with Justin Verlander.

"The tale of a teen outcast turned murderous prom queen: With all that’s gone down on the second season of “Riverdale” — a hunt for a hooded serial killer, the football team moonlighting as a local militia, Archie and the gang getting high on a drug called jingle-jangle — that hardly ranks as a compelling B-plot on any given episode.  Singing and dancing about the horrors of high school, however, make for a very special installment of the hit CW series. Wednesday’s episode, the series’ first official foray into the depths of the musical-on-TV genre, revolves around a teen production of “Carrie: The Musical.” Adapted from the classic 1974 Stephen King novel, the musical has been called the “most expensive quick flop in Broadway history.” Nevertheless, it’s found a home in “Riverdale,” a massively popular TV show that deals with similar themes ― the good-girl-versus-mean-girl binary, raging teenage hormones and bloodshed. But since buckets of pig’s blood lack a certain visual panache in 2018, the cast of “Riverdale” lends the story a horrific new ending. (Spoiler alert!) Instead of simply acting out King’s familiar finale, the teens witness an actual murder when a student is stabbed multiple times on stage unbeknownst to the audience. Leave it to “Riverdale” to turn up the camp and the crazy for a musical episode unlike any we’ve seen before.  The episode came to life thanks to series creator Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, the man who once staged an unauthorized production of the gold-standard “Buffy” musical episode as a Yale drama student. Aguirre-Sacasa actually envisioned “Riverdale” as a musical series in the beginning stages of development. He’s been angling to do a full-blown production ever since.  “Originally, we always thought that there would be a stronger musical element and the kids would do school musicals, but as the show developed, it became more of a crime and noir show,” he told HuffPost. “But, by this point, even the superhero shows had done musical episodes, so I think the network was, like, if we’re letting these shows do it, we better let the show about high school kids do musicals, too.” Musical episodes on television, much like the high school musicals of real life, have indeed become something of a rite of passage. What was once a set-your-DVR-or-regret-it event is now an increasingly regular milestone for shows including “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” “Scrubs” and “The Flash.” (Not to mention “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” which gifts the world with a mini-musical every week.) As a result, it’s never been harder to stand out. Of course, “Riverdale” slips easily into its new skin as Archie (K.J. Apa), Betty (Lili Reinhart), Veronica (Camila Mendes) and Cheryl (Madelaine Pestch) get in touch with their inner theater kids. The town’s resident fire-starter, Cheryl, takes on the role of Carrie White, a socially ostracized, telekinetic girl repressed by her religious fanatic mother. Betty, naturally, plays good girl Sue Snell, who initially bullies Carrie but succumbs to remorse. Veronica embodies the titular teen’s tormenter, Chris Hargensen. Finally, Archie fits nicely into the boy-next-door slot as Tommy Ross, Carrie’s ill-fated prom date. Dressed in peak ’70s garb, the musically inclined actors belt their way through 11 songs from the musical, gathering for an especially impressive opening group number, “In,” that requires each of the cast members to show off their singing chops and some serious choreography. Meanwhile, Jughead, not exactly the song-and-dance type, films a behind-the-scenes documentary after actor Cole Sprouse took a hard pass on any musical moments.  “He’s a Broadway Scrooge,” Casey Cott, who plays the musical’s director, Kevin Keller, joked. “I’ve seen him do karaoke, and I’ve seen him dancing on the dance floor. That kid can move.” Back in 1988, when “Carrie: The Musical” first opened more than a decade after the Brian De Palma film hit theaters, the production closed after a handful of performances due to scathing reviews. ”‘Carrie’ expires with fireworks like the Hindenberg,” a New York Times theater critic wrote in a particularly savage takedown at the time. The show, however, found its audience years later, amassing a cult following that flocked to see revivals in London and Los Angeles. That audience included Aguirre-Sacasa, a self-professed mega-fan of the “Carrie” story who wrote the screenplay for a tepidly received 2013 movie remake starring Chloë Grace Moretz, which he described as a “very fraught” ordeal. “It was not the most artistically satisfying or pleasant experience in my career,” he said. “I’ll save you the gory details. It sort of soured me to ‘Carrie.’ I really feel like this musical has allowed me to take it back as something I love and feel good about after years of not feeling good about it.” Before landing on “Carrie,” Aguirre-Sacasa’s team considered staging other productions, like “Little Shop of Horrors” and “Sweeney Todd.” He even contemplated using songs from an original musical based on Archie Comics characters that he wrote before he was brought on as the company’s chief creative officer in 2014. “It never got produced, but it has really good songs. I briefly thought if we can’t get the rights to ‘Carrie’ we’ll do ‘Archie: The Musical,’” he said.  But the disastrous prom saga seemed almost tailor-made for the series, which is why Aguirre-Sacasa stuck primarily to script, save for the addition of a few distinctively “Riverdale” flourishes ― mainly that twist ending that revives the mystery of the Black Hood, the town’s believed-to-be-dead serial killer. The musical is “literally about a girl who goes crazy and kills everybody with blood all down her face,” Cott said. “Cheryl does that, and no one is surprised.” Overall, the musical feels expertly suited to highlight the series’ biggest draw: the core four characters. In a season paced at break-neck speed, the lion’s share of the “Riverdale” plot has been dedicated to a whirlwind of murder mysteries, mayoral races, long-lost siblings and corruption scandals. This episode gives the series a much-needed chance to breathe by finding crucial moments to revisit some of the relationships that made the show a success in the first place.  In one of the episode’s most inspired plot diversions, Betty sings “You Shine,” a love song featured in the original musical, to Veronica instead of her onstage paramour as a peace offering after a particularly nasty fight.  “Even though there’s this big shocking ending, the musical allows us to focus more exclusively on the friendships, which we don’t always get to do because we are so frantically telling other stories,” Aguirre-Sacasa said. As “Riverdale” rockets off toward the season finale, perhaps that’s the lesson it should take to heart ahead of Season 3. (Netflix recently picked up two seasons of a “Sabrina the Teenage Witch” spinoff, too.) Sure, the show thrives on crazy plot twists (remember: the town was founded on maple syrup blood money, after all), but how it builds upon the iconic characters of comic book lore in new and interesting ways will always be its lifeblood.   And should the musical experiment prove to be a success, the powers that be have every intention of making this a tradition for the show that has no incentive to stick to form. “Every week ‘Riverdale’ is something different,” Aguirre-Sacasa said. “One week, it’s a serial killer show or ‘The Godfather’ in a small town and the next it’s a political thriller or a homage to ‘The Wrestler.’”  “The show is naturalistic, but it also exists in this weird area where the musical episode comes in and makes total sense,” Cott added. “It’s not all ‘Glee’ or flashy. It’s actually really weird and such a ‘Riverdale’ story.”  As for who might take the reins the next time around, Cott has some suggestions: “One day we’ll get Cole into a musical episode. In Season 3, he can be the lead.” ",that,prove,form
"By Yasmeen Abutaleb and Anya George Tharakan (Reuters) - Facebook Inc's quarterly revenue rose more than 50 percent, handily beating Wall Street expectations as its wildly popular mobile app and a push into live video lured new advertisers and encouraged existing ones to boost spending. The company's shares rose 9.5 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday to $118.39, setting it on track to open at a new high on Thursday, at nearly triple its initial public offering four years ago. Facebook also announced it will create a new class of non-voting shares in a move aimed at letting Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg give away his wealth without relinquishing control of the social media juggernaut he founded. The company plans to create a new class of non-voting shares, which would be given as a dividend to existing shareholders. That would allow Zuckerberg, who wants to give away 99 percent of his wealth, to sell non-voting stock to fund philanthropy and keep the voting stock that assures his control. Alphabet Inc. passed a similar proposal in 2014 that ensured its founders' control by creating new non-voting shares. Some 1.65 billion people used Facebook monthly as of March 31, up from 1.44 billion a year earlier. Zuckerberg said users were spending more than 50 minutes per day on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, a huge amount of time given the millions of apps available to users. Advertisers are shifting money from television to web and mobile platforms, and Facebook is one of the biggest beneficiaries. It faces fierce competition in the mobile video market, where rivals Snapchat and YouTube also garner billions of video views every day. Facebook recently expanded its live video product, rolling out several new features and making it more prominent on the app to encourage users to create videos and share them. The quarterly results showed success attracting advertisers with the move, and the company was able to expand its operating profit margin to 55 percent from 52 percent a year earlier. ""The company consistently 'warns' about higher spending, but they consistently manage their spending to deliver earnings upside. They're an impressive company, and they leave very little room for criticism,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter, who called the operating margin a good surprise. Facebook did not offer details on sales of its Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, but emphasized that it was early days and said that sales would not significantly impact 2016 revenue. The results come after disappointments for investors from several major Silicon Valley firms. ""After Intel and IBM last week, and then Twitter and Apple yesterday, this is by far the best number I’ve seen in technology,"" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company which owns about $40 million worth of Facebook shares, commenting specifically about Facebook ad revenue. Facebook has not begun advertising on some of its most popular apps. ""They haven't yet turned on the monetization spigot for Messenger or WhatsApp, so there should be significant headroom still,"" said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. The company's net income attributable to common shareholders nearly tripled to $1.51 billion, or 52 cents per share, in the first quarter from $509 million, or 18 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 77 cents per share, beating Wall Street's 62-cent consensus. Total revenue rose to $5.38 billion from $3.54 billion, with ad revenue increasing 56.8 percent to $5.20 billion. Mobile ad revenue accounted for about 82 percent of total ad revenue, compared with about 73 percent a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $5.26 billion. If the stock proposal is approved - and Zuckerberg has a majority of voting stock - the company will effectively carry out a 3-for-1 stock split, issuing two shares of non-voting Class C capital stock as a one-time stock dividend for each share of Class A and Class B common stock. Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced last year that they would give away 99 percent of their Facebook shares to fund charitable endeavors. Investors said they were not concerned that Zuckerberg would have increasing control, pointing to the company's consistent ability to grow and exceed expectations. ""I honestly don't think anyone cares if he has more power, since he's done everything right since they went public,"" said Pachter.

"Hugh Hefner’s life and legacy are rife with contradictions.  The founder of the Playboy empire, who died Wednesday at age 91, is hailed as a sexual revolutionary, a supporter of LGBTQ and abortion rights, a mogul and an icon who paved the way for modern ideas about sex-positivity. He’s also a man who built his extensive empire by capitalizing on idealized images of women’s bodies; a man who had a rotating cast of live-in young “girlfriends” who, by at least one account, were kept under his control. As The New York Times’ Brooks Barnes put it in 2009: “To his supporters, [Hefner] is the great sexual liberator who helped free Americans from Puritanism and neurosis. To his detractors, including many feminists and social conservatives, he helped set in motion a revolution in sexual attitudes that have objectified and victimized countless women and promoted an immoral, whatever-feels-good approach to life.”  The truth is somewhere in the middle. Hefner was surely an advocate for sexual liberation, but that sexual liberation was always first and foremost about the desires of straight men. Put another way: His sexual revolution was self-serving. * * * When it came to politics, Hefner consistently aligned himself with progressive ideals. He was known for his early support of reproductive rights, civil rights and LGBTQ rights. In Hef’s eyes, sex of any kind ― and the health care and decisions that surround sex ― shouldn’t be attached to shame. (And the government certainly shouldn’t be a moral arbiter of its citizens’ desires.)   Playboy began publishing articles advocating for abortion rights in 1963 ― nearly a decade before the seminal Roe v. Wade decision, and railed in 2016 against right-wing presidential candidates who “campaign on promises to eliminate access to birth control, ban abortion, pass discriminatory laws against gays, and regulate or outright ban any lifestyle or preference that doesn’t fit into their Christian crusade to eliminate all sexual activity that doesn’t lead to procreation.” Hefner supported the Equal Rights Amendment, and the Playboy Foundation, founded in 1965, funded the Kinsey Institute and rape crisis centers. Hefner was a vocal advocate for marriage equality, and, in a 1955 editorial, asserted that “if it was wrong to persecute heterosexuals in a homosexual society, then the reverse was wrong, too.” Civil rights icons including Malcolm X and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. were interviewed in Playboy. In 1959, Hefner organized the Playboy Jazz Festival in Chicago, and gross receipts from the festival’s first day went to the NAACP. The Rev. Jesse Jackson even tweeted out a remembrance of Hefner on Thursday morning, calling him a “strong supporter of the civil rights movement.” But even progressive political bona fides don’t give powerful men a get-out-of-being-a-member-of-the-patriarchy-free card.  Over the course of Hefner’s 60-plus years in the public eye, he was a contradictory and controversial figure within feminist circles, and with good reason.  Perhaps the most well-known exploration of Hefner’s Playboy Clubs, a membership-based chain of nightclubs, lounges and resorts, was written in 1963 by a young Gloria Steinem. Before she was a feminist icon, Steinem was a journalist who went undercover as “Marie,” a 24-year-old on the upper edge of the acceptable age range for employment as a Playboy Bunny, and got hired as a Bunny at the New York City Playboy Club. She wrote a two-part exposé on the experience, detailing the hiring process, the pay and the work.  In his clubs, wrote Steinem, the black women who worked for Playboy were not just Bunnies, like their white counterparts, they were Chocolate Bunnies. His female employees were expected to look a specific way that would be pleasing to the club’s male clientele and would encourage them to buy more drinks. The Bunnies received “demerits” for things like messy hair, bad nails, bad makeup, eating on the job and chewing gum. And despite the high wages boasted about on Bunny job listings, the club took 50 percent of the first $30 in tips each Bunny made per day, and Bunnies were on the hook for the cost of maintaining a Playboy-acceptable appearance. At the end of the second installment of Steinem’s exposé, she lists off things that she has overheard over the course of her day at the club. “He’s a real gentleman. He treats you the same whether you’ve slept with him or not,” one Bunny remarks about a client.  An element of performance was inherent to the type of female sexuality that Playboy created and pushed. If the Bunnies at Hefner’s famous clubs, or his live-in girlfriends, appeared to be enjoying themselves, what else mattered? They all lived lives that looked glittery. Hugh Hefner is rightly remembered for rebelling against right wing moralism before most people, but please don't forget he treated women like garbage to do it. More disturbing claims were levied against Hefner by his former girlfriend Holly Madison in her 2015 book, Down the Rabbit Hole: Curious Adventures and Cautionary Tales of a Former Playboy Bunny. Madison paints Hefner as a controlling man who bordered on verbally abusive at times.  Madison wrote about her initiation as a Hefner girlfriend in which she quickly learned that living in the Playboy Mansion came with chore-like sexual duties. She said she became isolated, going through bouts of deep depression over her years with Hefner. (She claims that Hefner wouldn’t allow her to seek therapy.) “During the end, I definitely recognized that he was verbally abusive, and that was what made me snap,” Madison told BuzzFeed in 2015. “There were so many things in the relationship I wasn’t fully comfortable with, but I was able to justify them in my mind because there were other advantages to being there.” In response to Madison’s book, Hefner said that she had “chosen to rewrite history” to try to “stay in the spotlight.” And just last year, Hefner was sued by model Chloe Goins, who claimed that Hefner had conspired to allow Bill Cosby to drug and assault her at the Playboy Mansion in 2008. (Hefner denied the claims.) To some of the women who worked with or for Hefner over the years, he was a godsend ― or at the very least a useful advocate. His magazine gave “Redefining Realness” author Janet Mock her first editorial internship. He groomed his daughter Christie Hefner to succeed him as CEO, which she did for 20 years. “Hef changed my life. He made me the person I am today,” former girlfriend Kendra Wilkinson told People. But for others, like Madison, he was something darker.  * * * From the very first issue of Playboy ― the one with a radiant Marilyn Monroe on the cover, smiling next to the tagline “Entertainment for Men” ― it was clear that women’s needs were not core to the brand.  “If you’re somebody’s sister, wife or mother-in-law and picked us up by mistake, please pass us along to the man in your life and get back to your Ladies Home Companion,” Hefner wrote. To Hefner, sexual liberation meant the acceptance and visibility of male desire, coupled with the ability of women to publicly fulfill those desires and appear as outwardly sexual beings. But an opening of sexual mores on straight men’s terms does not mean an automatic upgrade for all women. As any woman who has had sex with a man knows, what works for his orgasm and general sexual fulfillment is not always what works for yours. And in a patriarchal society, an openly sexual man gets to play by different rules on an entirely different field than an openly sexual woman.  This explains why he reacted so poorly to radical feminist critiques of Playboy’s nude centerfolds, typically featuring big breasts and seductive poses. “What I’m interested in is the highly irrational, emotional, kookie trend that feminism has taken in the last couple of years,” he wrote in an internal 1970 memo. “These chicks are our natural enemy and there is ... nothing we can say in the pages of Playboy that will convince them that we are not. It is time to do battle with them and I think we can do it.”  Ultimately, Hefner never set out to create a true sexual revolution. He set out to create a sexual revolution that would benefit him. He used his own desires and frustrations as a lens through which to build out entertainment for other men like him, and to push the envelope of what was considered socially acceptable. Some of those desires and frustrations happened to help open up space for people who weren’t straight, white, rich men to more openly express their sexuality. Others did not. In 2009, Hefner reflected on his legacy in The New York Times: “We just literally live in a very different world and I played a part in making it that way.”  It’s hard to argue with that. ",who,hailed,positivity
"I come in peace.  I have been hard on you in the past.  At times, I was insensitive to the fact that you are husbands, wives, Moms and Dads.  You have mortgages to pay and children to educate.  You’re under pressure to generate revenue for your employer, and they’re not exactly a charitable group. All too frequently, you met your revenue goals by selling products you knew weren’t suitable for your clients.  Typically, these were high commission investments, like non-traded REITS, annuities, hedge funds, structured notes and derivatives.  The core of your investment strategy was (and likely still is) the sale of high expense ratio, actively managed mutual funds.  These funds often tacked on sales charges (called “front-end loads”), which could range from 3% to 8.5%.  When investors protested, the mutual fund industry created a “back-end load,” which penalized investors who sold prior to holding for six years.  In addition, these funds charged a 12b-1 marketing fee of about 1% a year. You’re an intelligent group.  You’ve known for a long time that this was a giant rip-off.  Your clients would likely have been far better off in a low management fee index fund from a fund family like Vanguard.  But you had bills to pay.  Your branch manager was ruthless about meeting quotas, and relatively few investors knew about the benefits of index funds. Now, everything has changed.  Over the past three years, investors have pulled $525 billion from U.S. actively managed stock funds (like the ones you’ve been selling).  Index and passive funds had inflows of $458 billion during the same period. The writing is on the wall.  We both know it.  Investors are more savvy.  They’re not falling for the shopworn pitch about your ability to time the market, pick outperforming stocks or select the next “hot” fund manager.  Your business is in jeopardy. The news isn’t all bleak.  While a door has closed, a large window has opened.  Instead of fighting against index- based investing, join it.  It’s a much more appealing position to take with investors.  You’ll be doing the right thing and impacting your clients positively. Instead of relying on your wit and guile, and ultimately deceiving your clients, you can embrace the overwhelming academic evidence supporting index-based investing.  It’s a piece of cake compared to what you have been doing. I know what you’re thinking.  How will you demonstrate your value when anyone can buy index funds directly from fund families?  How will you justify your fee? Don’t worry.  I’ve got you covered. In The Smartest Portfolio You’ll Ever Own, I provide the academic underpinnings for a “SuperSmart Portfolio”, consisting of nine ETFs and index funds.  The stock portion of this portfolio tilts towards small size and value stocks.  It optimizes the trade-off between risk and return.  It minimizes risk by including seven asset classes for stocks and two asset classes for bonds, providing broad, global diversification.  While some investors can implement this portfolio without assistance, it’s too complicated for many.  Other investors, like trustees of a trust or sponsors of a retirement plan, will be strongly inclined to retain an advisor.  You’ll be perfectly positioned to assist them. Here’s another reason why this shift to a sound, academically based investment strategy is in your best interest.  There’s been a strong trend towards managed accounts, where the primary revenue generator is the management fee.  That fee is not affected by which investments are in the portfolio.  You can do right by your clients and not sacrifice income!  it’s a win-win. Do you have an option?  Are you just going to watch your clients flee to index funds?  I’m offering you a far better choice.  You can be pro-active.  You can differentiate yourself from your colleagues who are simply hoping investors won’t figure out there’s a better way.  You’ll be offering them that way! There are hundreds of thousands of stockbrokers in the U.S.  What if only 10% of you adopted my suggestion?  Think about the number of investors whose lives you can change. Finally, reach out to me.  I’ll help you make the transition.  I mean it. I told you I came in peace.

"Two New York City police officers were suspended after witnesses said they failed to leave their car to check on a young woman who was later found dead at the bottom of a stairwell. The woman’s husband, Barry Wells, faces charges in her death, police said. On Wednesday morning, a neighbor called police when she heard Tonie Wells, 22, scream, “Help me, he’s going to kill me” during an argument with her husband in their Brooklyn home, 1010 WINS radio reported.  According to “preliminary reports I received, they did not exit the vehicle and that’s troubling,” said the Brooklyn borough president, Eric Adams. After authorities received a second phone call from a neighbor, who said the Wells’ 2-year-old daughter was crying, additional police officers responded. They found Tonie Wells unresponsive at the bottom of a stairwell in the brownstone where she lived with her husband. She had bruising around her neck, police said, and was declared dead at the scene.  The 2-year-old, who was physically unhurt, was found crying near her mother’s body. She’s now staying with relatives.  Barry Wells, 29, was first transported to an area hospital after he told police he had taken pills in a suicide attempt. This turned out not to be true, chief of detectives Robert Boyce said at a press conference on Thursday.  “Mr. Wells did make statements about the problems they had,” Boyce said. “They had an on-again, off-again, living arrangement.” Barry Wells was free on $5,000 bail on charges that he choked his wife in September. He is currently in police custody and will be charged after investigators receive autopsy results. Boyce said tracking the trouble in the couple’s relationship may have been complicated by the fact that Barry Wells was arrested in September in Manhattan while his wife was staying there with her mother, but the latest incident occurred at their home in Brooklyn. An investigation into the actions of the two first police responders is ongoing, Police Commissioner James O’Neill said. “I talk about my pride in the NYPD each and every day,” O’Neill said at the press conference. “If, unfortunately, there are times that we don’t live up to that standard, it’s up to us to make sure that we fully investigate that. And if discipline needs to be dealt out, we’ll do that.” Barry Wells proposed to Tonie by hiding an engagement ring inside a food delivery package. A video of the proposal was posted on Facebook: The couple wed in April. In another Facebook post last year, Wells urged men to treat the mother of their children with respect:",he,was,September
"At least two organizations have decided to drop Morgan Freeman after eight women accused him of inappropriate behavior and sexual harassment. Women who previously worked with the Oscar-winning actor told CNN that he repeatedly made comments about their bodies or their clothing and frequently engaged in inappropriate touching. In response to the allegations, Visa announced it had suspended him from its marketing campaign. “We are aware of the allegations that have been made against Mr. Freeman. At this point, Visa will be suspending our marketing in which the actor is featured,” Visa said in a statement. TransLink, Vancouver’s public transit system, also decided to stop using Freeman’s voice as part of an ad campaign to promote its Visa credit card and mobile payments on bus and Skytrain operations. “In light of information we’ve learned ... of allegations regarding actor Morgan Freeman, TransLink has decided to pause his voice announcements as part of a Visa ad campaign on our transit system,” the transit system said a statement. “We will be reaching out to Visa to discuss further.” TransLink to pause Morgan Freeman SkyTrain announcements over sexual harassment allegations https://t.co/R9IxPRtvPu pic.twitter.com/M9lSVunVuz A few hours after the report was released, Freeman, 80, issued an apology: “Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy, I apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected — that was never my intent.” A production assistant working on the 2015 film “Going in Style” said Morgan made numerous comments about her body, asked her several times if she was wearing underwear and tried to lift her skirt. Another worker on the set said women wore loose-fitting clothing in an effort to avoid Freeman’s attention. Entertainment Tonight released footage on Thursday evening of two on-air interviews with Freeman that also revealed his attitude toward women. During an interview for the 2016 film “London Has Fallen,” Freeman asked a young female reporter, “My goodness, are you married? Fool around with other guys? I’m just asking.” In 2015, he told author Janet Mock: “You got a dress halfway between your knee and your hips, and you sit down right across from me and you cross your legs.” Mock, who was a special correspondent for the interview, said Freeman’s treatment of her was an “exhibition of the casual nature at which men in positions of power believe that everything belongs to them, including women’s bodies.” Freeman’s union, SAG-AFTRA, is considering what to do about Freeman’s Life Achievement Award. The award is given to actors who represent the “finest ideals of the acting profession,” CNN reported. “These are compelling and devastating allegations which are absolutely contrary to all the steps that we are taking to ensure a safe work environment,” the union said in a statement. “Any accused person has the right to due process, but it is our starting point to believe the courageous voices who come forward to report incidents of harassment ... we are reviewing what corrective actions may be warranted at this time.”",that,are,Freeman
"Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney says she reported the sexual abuse she says she endured from former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar to her coach, John Geddert, in 2011, but no action was taken.  “I was in the car driving back to the hotel. And I even said out loud that last night Larry was fingering me,” Maroney, 22, told NBC “Today” co-host Savannah Guthrie in a Sunday night segment of “Dateline.” Maroney said she reported the abuse while she and her teammates were at the gymnastics world championships in Tokyo. Geddert and a few of Maroney’s teammates, including gymnast and Nassar abuse survivor Aly Raisman, were in the car the night she spoke up. Maroney, who was 15 at the time, said Geddert didn’t say anything in response, while others in the car “gasped” loudly. Raisman told “Dateline” that Maroney “basically described in graphic detail what Nassar had done to her the night before.” Two other people in the car that night corroborated Maroney’s story to “Dateline.” Geddert worked in the gymnastics world for decades before he was suspended by USA Gymnastics in January in light of the allegations against Nassar, with whom the coach was reportedly very close. Geddert quickly resigned after being suspended and is under criminal investigation.  “That was the moment that I shut it down,” Maroney said of Geddert allegedly not responding to her cry for help. “In my head, I was never gonna speak about [Nassar] again. And I was just gonna go along with it.” Geddert did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Watch a clip of the “Dateline” interview below. “I was bawling naked on a bed him on top of me, and I thought I was gonna die.” @McKaylaMaroney details one of Larry Nassar’s worst nights of abuse in an @NBCNews exclusive interview with @savannahguthrie pic.twitter.com/FGfi1SYQAK Nassar, who also served as a doctor at Michigan State University, has been accused of sexually abusing over 260 young athletes. Over the last year, he pleaded guilty to several counts of sexual assault of minors and possessing child pornography and is serving three concurrent prison sentences of up to 175 years.  Maroney said she decided to speak up during the car ride in Toyko because she was “desperate.” The previous night, she said, Nassar’s sexual assault had been worse than ever. “I didn’t feel like it was him anymore,” Maroney said of the incident, which she also detailed when she first went public in an October Twitter post about Nassar’s abuse. “It was this other thing that took over ― the dark part of him. ... He went like overboard that night I was bawling, naked, on a bed, him on top of me. And I thought I was going to die.” “For the first time, to me, [it] was very, very hard for me to not acknowledge the fact that this was something ― this was not treatment. I was being abused,” Maroney said. “I remember waking up the next day and wanting to tell someone.” Teammates Maroney, Raisman and Jordyn Wieber said they would often return to their hotel rooms during competition and discuss what Nassar was doing to them.  “We would say, you know, maybe he doesn’t realize he’s touching us,” Raisman told Guthrie. “Maybe he doesn’t even know what’s going on. And he’s a doctor. He’s the Olympic doctor.” Maroney had signed a confidentiality settlement with USA Gymnastics in December 2016 barring her from sharing her story. The organization said in January it wouldn’t seek to punish Maroney for breaking the agreement.",he,pleaded,years
"Sometimes the magic and beauty of the classroom, the soaring beyond simple skills and content, happens in the most unexpected ways. At these moments, we are experiencing a kind of performance art in the classroom. Take the following example. The Greek tragedies are old and in many ways stiff and odd to modern students.  If we get into them closely, however, they are as familiar as the dilemmas and terrible choices of today.  During the reading of Aeschylus' Oresteia with my junior English class at Berkeley High, I continually referred to my own experience with the Vietnam war, the destruction it wrought, the curse that came back home. We talked about gang violence, sports rivalries, and loyalties.   In addition, the class watched Woody Allen's Mighty Aphrodite. It is a light and silly movie on one level but it brings students closer to Hellenic forms:  it gives us a Greek chorus, and feisty chorus leader and even doom-seeing Cassandra, in an understandable context. Actually, the chorus scenes were shot in Athens at the theater. It also shows some modern dilemmas and complexities (adopted child, mystery of parentage, the danger of trying to play god and control fate) in a humorous way.  Students then wrote a quick treatment, an outline for another Woody Allen movie, based on the terrible story of the House of Atreus.   In my planning, I felt it would be enough to help my students understand the perspective on New Yorker critic David Denby:  ""Aeschylus offers not the glare of righteous vengeance but the anguish of the wounded men and women in conflict.  In the remainder of the trilogy, Agamemnon's children take their revenge against their murderous mother and her lover and the Furies, the loathsome harpies of retribution, then hound the avengers - until at last the goddess Athena calls a jury of Athenians to decide the case.  Orestes, Agamemnon's son, is freed, the Furies packed off; the city-state triumphs, law triumphs, the dark dream fades away.  The Oresteia can be understood, though not complacently (it's too bloody for that), as a fable chronicling the passage from barbarism to civilization, from blood feud to law, from vengeance to justice - from the primitive past, in other words, to fifth century Athens."" (Great Books, p. 134).   Or can it?  In the hands of my students, the story revealed something different and much more unsettling.   ""I'm not sure,"" said 'Naka.  ""Now we have a trial.  And a jury, probably of wealthy citizens.  Certainly if the jury is made up of audience members, then it's those who can afford expensive theater tickets.""
""Yeah,"" added Valentina. ""I would never trust the courts.  Plus it looks like all male lawyers running the courtroom.""
""Yup yup,"" chimed in Chris, ""Clytemnestra was right to get at her man and now you know she'll do time.  She can't plead abused spouse syndrome."" In a beautiful moment of synthesis, the students were doing what I had been working months and months to accomplish -- bringing their own lived experience, their own strong critical selves, to the text.  Besides doubting the court system, which they see as part of the prison-industrial complex, they challenged us to relook at the history.  I realized that those who have been victims of the imperial project do not necessarily accept the categories of ""barbarism"" and ""civilization"".  When students have power over the discourse in a classroom in America, inevitably issues of race and power, gender and hierarchies, equity and social justice force themselves on the agenda.    As we continued through the plays, students questioned the rational, civic, patriarchal order known as civilization and wondered whether the anger of the women, the revenge of Clytemnestra for the brutal sacrifice of her daughter (the men cut her open on the altar to appease the seas and assure safe passage so they could go on an imperial venture of conquest against Troy) might indeed by justified.  New perspectives began to fall into place:  the value of the old earth goddesses who were overthrown by the Olympian gods; the importance of tribal spirituality that saw every tree and river as holy as opposed to the history-intervening gods who called for conquest; the value of mother right, women's passion and women's intuition. Aeschylus' chorus chides Clytemnestra for being too manly, the same charge made against Lady Macbeth 2000 years later.  But indeed it was her strong woman-power which made the men uncomfortable.  The Furies, the old earth goddesses, must be subdued in order for repressive class society to function.    As students started to take ownership of the play, as they began to inhabit it and speak it back, all the suppressed conflicts and battles of their own institutionalized worlds came to light.  One student wrote:  ""The text began to make sense; it went from being forbidding and difficult to poetic and gorgeous.""  They tacked between making a social critique and looking to how they were implicated in this repression, their own hearts of darkness. They chided themselves for at first avoiding the frightening truths in the Oresteia, pointing out that they had used comforting ignorance, protective ignorance, to avoid confronting the historic and personal struggles that were right there.  This was an ideal teaching situation. We read the text together, stopped to write and reflect often.  We saw the play performed at the Berkeley Repertory Theater. And we took our time. Something rather magic took hold of the room.  Students came to class eager to start the discussion.  New texts and media pieces were thrown into the pot. Students wrote and recited.  Essays and poems and polemics came pouring out. I have written about this particular unit before because it is such a rich story.  But only now have I come to see something else about these kinds of teaching moments. I had many teaching intentions going into this unit. At the forefront of my pedagogical thinking is equity and engagement for all students, especially those African American and Chicano Latino students who have been most marginalized by our education system. While this has often taken the form of struggling for a broader canon, more texts and perspectives from oppressed communities, I am also convinced that most ""classic"" and western texts can also be approached in a critical, relevant, and powerful way.   Those were my intentions, but I had no idea how it would roll out. The path ahead, the classroom exploration, was a story as yet unwritten. What happened was beyond my expectations.  For some reason, the themes and poetry of Aeschylus had taken hold of their imagination. Just about every day, new insights, new themes, new questions arose. Whether it was the struggle for women's power or the unbearable pain of lives lost in wasteful cycles of revenge, the students owned the story. This was not a class about decoding a dusty tome.  It was a moment of creative outburst - filled with new insights, new knowledge, and new beauty.   The words on the page, the words Aeschylus wrote out 2500 years ago, were just like musical notes on a page. The music only happens when someone reads those little black squiggles, makes some sense of what they suggest, and then performs the piece. Our students were not reading the Oresteia, they were performing it. Experiences like this have made me conclude that we have to see teaching as art. I don't just mean ""the art of teaching."" The latter concept is that to teach well you need not only structure and plans and outcomes but you need intuition and creativity to get the job done. I agree with that and certainly there is an art to teaching. But I'm talking about something else when I say ""teaching as art.""  We generally think of ""artists"" as creating the texts we study - poets, authors, painters, filmmakers, etc.  And we, the teachers and critics, are supposed to talk about this art, appreciate this art, understand this art.  I contend, though, that the teaching itself is an instance of art, an art which you can consider in the same way you might think of the art of writing or painting.  Something new had happened in that classroom, something that could not be easily codified, explained, or written out in a script for the next teacher.  Like other art, it was ineffable, transcendent, and more than the sum of its parts. Now, does art happen every day in the classroom? No it does not. Plenty of times it is just decoding, just ""the boring bits,"" the obligatory training. And some days the lesson plan simply crashes and burns.  This might be because of an emergency interruption from the administration (you'd be surprised how often this happens), an off-task outburst of fights or crises, or simply something funny that got everyone laughing and forgetting where we were. But it happens, art happens. And it happens in all classes, not only English. It is right there in social science, it rears its head often in science and math, and it certainly is active in international language class.  The most fun part of teaching is getting to those moments. And certainly some teachers are more adept at getting there, have learned intuitively how to create the conditions for art to break out; other teachers fear it and nip it in the bud if it starts to appear. But, as in all human culture, art strives to burst forth. I thought of teaching as art as I read a New York Times review of Harold Bloom's The Daemon Knows.  It is yet another volume produced by this most prolific English critic.  And, while he is generally identified as academically conservative, I never read Bloom without coming across new insights.

Times reviewer Cynthia Ozick, appreciating the power of Bloom's criticism, says, ""If, as Emerson claims, the true ship is the shipbuilder, then is the true poem the critic who maps and parses and inhabits it? Can poet and critic be equal seers?""  She is asking whether the critic might indeed have standing as an artist.  And if this is true, does not the teacher also?  Bloom himself writes with the passion and engagement of an artist, declaring that Whitman ""overwhelms me, possesses me, as only a few others . .  . consistently flood my entire being.  He also says, ""True criticism recognizes itself as a mode of memoir."" And even: ""I believe there is no critical method except yourself."" These are the exact sentiments of an artist, and a strong critic, as well as an engaged teacher.   The particular art of teaching is that it requires the teacher to let others play the music, let them create action.  For good education to happen, for education art to happen, students must choose to engage and must affirmatively act.  As Bill Ayers says, teaching ""is an invitation offered and an act of faith.  It is filled with hope and undertaken without guarantees.""  (To Teach, p 137)  It is as much letting go as holding on. When you look at the elements of art, and what makes a production art, you get into the deeper aspects of aesthetics.  Take poetry.  Too often we make the mistake of ""teaching"" a poem by illustrating various techniques that were used, rhyme, assonance, meter, metaphor, etc. Even worse is the poetry teacher who insists that students pull out the ""message.""  If the message is all we're looking for, why not just write the message and dispose with the complications of a poem?  Techniques and themes are all there but somehow such a mechanical approach misses the thing that makes a piece poetry.   The best poetry teacher I had was Robert Kaufman who tried to describe what is unique about poetry.  He explained that the task of poetry was to take language, something which is supposed to communicate precise information, and make it communicate something beyond language, something that can't be simply said another way.  Somehow in the music, the imagery, the resonances that float above the words, somehow in there is the poetics of the poetry.
This is what I mean by the ineffability of art - the feeling tone that is beyond the formal meaning of the words.  Helen MacDonald, an amazing naturalist and hawk trainer, spoke about her work with raptors as art.  She was asked in an interview:
""You're an artist, a poet, a historian and a falconer as well as a writer. It feels to me as though (your book) H Is For Hawk drew on all those skills. Would you agree?"" Her response:  ""This question baffled me for a while. Training hawks isn't much like writing a poem or painting - but then I thought about it carefully and decided that maybe in a way it is. In all of them you have to invest yourself in something and work with it until you relinquish all control over it. That moment is deeply satisfying. The point when a picture is finished, when you can't do any more to it or it will spoil. Or when a poem you're revising clicks, fits together, and locks you out. In falconry you put all of your heart and hard-won skills into training the hawk, then cast it from your fist to fly free. Then all you can do is stand and watch, and wonder.""
And how is that not like the best of teaching?  In teaching too, you have to invest yourself in something and work with it until you relinquish all control over it. In teaching too you put all of your heart and hard-won skills into it, then cast it free. Then all you can do is stand and watch, and wonder. Looking at formal aesthetics, we also see other elements that are exactly what goes on in teaching.  For one thing, in the arts ""mistakes"" are not something to be avoided but the very heart of the work.  Artists make mistake after mistake, imperfect draft after imperfect draft, sketch after sketch, and then as some point transcendence happens, creativity has taken the piece beyond all the skills and baby steps.  Suddenly the piece soars.  As did the class discussion, a kind of performance art, as we discussed/performed the Oresteia.  In that classroom, new things happened, new un-nameable feelings and insights were generated.  Creativity flew in the window and flitted around the room, unharnessed and unafraid.  It was a moment, an extended moment, a series of moments, of art. And inevitably, this aspect of teaching, the teaching as art, is precisely what is never captured in the metrics of education ""reform.""  No standardized test or performance data picks up these powerful moments.  And yet they are where the heart of teaching and learning reside.  When teachers go home after work and find themselves unable to explain to friends and family the incredible, miraculous things that happened during their day, it is because these art moments are hard to explain, even more difficult to share. I have no idea what to do about this.  I have no proposal about how to change high stakes assessment.  The best we can do is describe this process of classroom aesthetics, again and again, until it begins to have a legitimacy, until it is visible and honored and sought after.  That is how artistic expression is put on the map and gets the respect it deserves.",that,are,poetry
"When it comes to addressing gun violence in the U.S., the general consensus seems to be that there’s no consensus. Gun owners and non-gun owners apparently can’t find common ground on policy solutions, which some Americans argue explains why there’s been so little action despite the mass shootings and other routine bloodshed of recent years. But that explanation might be a bit too simplistic, according to a new study comparing support for gun violence prevention policies among gun owners and non-gun owners. The survey, conducted in January 2017 by the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research and published Thursday in the American Journal of Public Health, found that both groups largely approve of the majority of the 24 proposals examined. For most of those policies, the approval gap between gun owners and non-gun owners was in the single digits. “This signals that we have higher levels of support and higher levels of agreement between gun owners and non-gun owners than is generally understood,” said Colleen Barry, a Johns Hopkins professor and the lead author of the study. Survey respondents were asked about a number of widely discussed gun measures, such as mandating universal background checks including for private sales of firearms, which are currently exempt under federal law. With support from 85 percent of gun owners and 89 percent of non-gun owners, this was the most popular proposal. The study revealed broad support for a variety of lesser-known policies as well. The second-most popular measure was suspending the license of any gun dealer unable to account for 20 or more guns in their inventory, which 82 percent of gun owners and 86 percent of non-gun owners backed. Just behind that was a proposal to require concealed-carry licensees to undergo safety and proficiency testing ― 83 percent of gun owners and 85 percent of non-gun owners expressed support. Large majorities of both groups also approved of so-called red flag laws. These measures give law enforcement additional authority to confiscate weapons from dangerous individuals, often following a petition filed by a family member or police. Four states have passed red flag laws since the Parkland, Florida, shooting in February, meaning nine states now have them on the books. A handful of other states are currently considering similar legislation. For 23 of the 24 proposals in the study, the majority of respondents came down on the side of greater gun restrictions or regulations. The least popular proposal involved prohibiting individuals convicted of drunk and disorderly conduct from possessing a gun for 10 years. On certain proposals, there were significant gaps between gun owners and non-gun owners. The two groups were sharply divided on allowing concealed-carry permit holders to bring guns onto school grounds, though neither gave the idea majority support. Forty-three percent of gun owners backed the proposal, compared to 19 percent of non-gun owners. There was also less agreement on requiring people to lock up firearms in the home when not in use ― 58 percent of gun owners supported the idea versus 79 percent of non-gun owners. The groups were similarly split, 63 percent to 81 percent, on requiring would-be gun owners to first obtain a license from a local law enforcement agency, as they must in Massachusetts. Some of the most divisive measures were among those most often proposed in public debate. The survey showed large gaps and less overall support for banning the sale of military-style semiautomatic rifles ― 44 percent of gun owners versus 68 percent of non-gun owners ― and banning the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines ― 41 percent of gun owners versus 67 percent of non-gun owners. These results could be used to guide decisions about which gun violence prevention measures to pursue, said study author Barry. “In my mind, the most fruitful directions for policy are areas where gun owners and non-gun owners are a little more in agreement,” she said. “If that’s where policymakers are interested in moving, there are a lot of policies to choose from.” Barry also noted that research on the effectiveness of a so-called assault weapons ban is somewhat limited, at least when it comes to reducing overall levels of gun violence. While lawmakers may understandably wish to prevent the sort of massacres that have been repeatedly carried out with AR-15s and similar rifles, she suggested they may not want to push that measure to the exclusion of more politically feasible proposals. “There are potentially lost opportunities to focus more attention and political capital around policies where we do see much higher levels of support overall, but also across the gun owner/non-gun owner divide,” she said. Barry has conducted similar studies twice before, with the first coming in January 2013, just weeks after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. She said that she was initially concerned that support for gun reforms might be merely a reaction to a recent tragedy, but that subsequent surveys in 2015 and now 2017 have shown stable support for many proposals among gun owners and non-gun owners alike. Although her latest survey was conducted before the Parkland shooting, Barry said she believes that event has likely only reinforced the public opinion trends seen in the 2017 survey, including the divisions on policies like banning assault weapons. “Folks who are in favor of a stronger regulatory environment may feel even more strongly about that, and folks on the other side who are more concerned about gun rights being restricted in the aftermath of recent events may or may not take a more stringent view,” she said. The question now is whether lawmakers at the state or federal level will focus on gun violence prevention policies that have wide support among both gun owners and non-gun owners. There are a few reasons they might not, even in the face of a vigorous push for gun reform following the Parkland shooting. For one, Barry’s study was national in scope, meaning it didn’t gauge public opinion in specific states or local jurisdictions, where gun policy is often decided. Then there’s the matter of lobbying by interest groups like the National Rifle Association, which hold plenty of political power ― perhaps even more than public opinion alone. “We’d like to think that members of Congress speak with the voice of their constituencies, but it doesn’t always happen like we hope it does,” said Barry. ",Some,were,debate
"In one of the most memorable scenes from “Grey’s Anatomy” Season 2, intern Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and head of neurosurgery Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) get it on in a Seattle Grace Hospital exam room while their colleagues attend a prom-style event for Richard Webber’s (James Pickens Jr.) cancer-stricken teenage niece. The pair, having been torn apart by the sudden employment of Derek’s estranged wife and fellow doctor Addison (Kate Walsh), dramatically reunite in only the way a fated TV couple can, culminating in Meredith’s misplaced underwear being pinned on a staff bulletin board. The whole thing is hot. It’s steamy. And it’s incredibly far-fetched. Or is it? There are lots of medical dramas on the air ― “Grey’s,” “Chicago Med,” “9-1-1,” “Code Black,” “The Resident,” etc. And each and every one features an unbelievable sex scene, during which surgeons hook up with interns (or nurses hook up with doctors, or chiefs hook up with residents ― you get it), turning their hospital’s on-call room into a veritable den of (consensual) sex among otherwise expertly professional co-workers. Ahead of the “Grey’s” Season 14 finale, we found ourselves contemplating several questions. Will April Kepner (Sarah Drew) get a happy ending? Will Alex (Justin Chambers) and Jo’s (Camilla Luddington) wedding go off without a hitch? Will Carina (Stefania Spampinato) follow Arizona (Jessica Capshaw) to New York? But none were more pressing than this longtime contemplation: Are the sex scenes on the show realistic?  So, HuffPost decided to get down to it and ask medical professionals what really happens in on-call rooms. Behold, the truth:  In Season 2, Episode 16 of “Grey’s,” Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) summons her friend-with-benefits Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) into a medical supply closet with the classic pickup line: “Do you want to stand there and talk metaphors or do you want to literally take off your pants?” Spoiler! He takes off his pants. Thus the question: Are doctors really hooking up in supply closets? According to Dr. Jen Gunter, a San Francisco Bay Area OB/GYN and author, most on-call rooms in hospitals are “gross and often you share them with someone else.”  “I have never, ever in my 30-plus years in the medical field heard of anyone ever making out in a supply closet. I have never heard of anyone having sex in an on-call room. Might it happen very occasionally? I guess,” she said.  A Philadelphia-based registered nurse named Meg (who preferred not to use her last name in this piece, because, well, who can blame her), said stairwells ― not supply closets, on-call rooms or exam rooms ― are where the secret hookups happen.  “I don’t know of it ever happening in empty patient rooms or supply closets. People are in and out of the supply room on the units all the time,” she said. “I have heard of people getting caught in stairwells and I have also heard of people getting caught in locker rooms.”  “I know of a girl hooking up in a stairwell,” Jessica, an RN based in Boston, said. “Less scandal than people think in general, though!” Eileen, a travel RN who’s worked in cities including New York, Seattle, San Diego and Boulder, said she knows of co-workers “sleeping with each other in their office and in an on-call room, always somewhere that has a lock on the door.” And a pediatrician in Westchester County, New York, who asked to remain anonymous, only wished life in a hospital was so exciting. “It may be that pediatricians are just way more boring than doctors in other specialties. I do know of a teenage patient who was caught hooking up with her boyfriend while admitted to the hospital ― we had to set up some stricter rules on visitors after that.” Throughout “Grey’s” Season 5, plastic surgeon Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) pursues intern Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) ― R.I.P., but let’s NOT relive that devastation ― despite warnings from Meredith and Derek against it. (Lexie is Meredith’s younger half-sister, after all.) The will-they-or-won’t-they, “inappropriate” relationship between Mark and Lexie became one of the most beloved by fans. But, do surgeons actually hook up with nurses, interns or students?  “I am aware of a scrub tech nurse who was involved with an orthopedic surgeon. They had a sexual relationship and she would send him naked pictures, which he would email to himself in the call-dictation room and save to the computer there to look at,” a Virginia-based nurse practitioner, who preferred to remain anonymous, explained. “Needless to say, he didn’t always remember to close out of the pictures before leaving. We all knew a lot more about that nurse than we wanted to!”  Meg said she knows a few residents who have dated junior colleagues, with some relationships eventually resulting in marriage. “We had a RN dating her manager ― it was kept hush-hush until she resigned and now they are married. Really it happens a ton!” she said. “I think there is a draw to a co-worker you spend lots of time with, who is smart and accomplished. They understand your stress level and what you go through. I think that it’s a lot harder to find a non-medical person who understands what a person in medicine would understand. Residents often marry other residents for this reason.”  Still, the nurse practitioner said, television shows tend to amp up the drama in these budding romances. “I no longer watch medical shows very much. I dislike how much romance there is among staff members, because I feel like it’s unrealistic.”  “It is a lie,” redditor TsukasaHimura reiterated in a thread about this topic. “Most doctors I work with are old and mean. I won’t have sex with any of them.”  Eileen, however, said she actually knows of a few racy doctor-nurse hookups.  “I have a friend who was engaged to be married and started working at my hospital. She started seeing this doctor we work with and started sleeping with him almost immediately. He was way older and not attractive, but he had money, power and gave her a whole lot of attention. I remember her telling me she would go into the staff bathroom and take nude pictures to send to him. I know they had sex in a staircase and in his office. She broke off her engagement because she felt guilty, and she did not end up with the doctor.” On many an occasion, the employees of Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital head to their local bar, Joe’s Pub, to let loose. Darts are thrown, shots are taken, dancing ensues. Is Joe’s Pub a fantasy, or is there truth to those tequila-filled nights? “My nurse friends and I absolutely got hammered together,” the nurse practitioner said, with Jessica adding, “Nurses be crazy!” “I went out more when I worked a night shift. Bloody Mary’s and beers at 7:30 a.m. before going to bed is way better than you would think,” Eileen said. “I haven’t really seen a post-work outing get drunk, but I have definitely seen it at retirement parties, birthday parties, etc.”  “All of the units I have worked on over the last 10 years always involved booze,” Meg said. “Usually, there is a bar or restaurant that is favored and you often see other employees there from different departments. I have also seen physicians out at restaurants being quite close to females that I know are not their wife!” The Westchester pediatrician, however, said drunken nights out have dwindled since the days of residency training. “I definitely went out frequently after shifts then. And getting drunk was certainly one way we coped with the stress and exhaustion of 80-hour work weeks during residency,” the pediatrician said. “I did know of colleagues who would go out to happy hour and then go to work a midnight ER shift. It was always a careful balance and calculation to make sure you were sober well before your shift started.” In probably the most famous cheating scandal from “Grey’s,” Derek’s wife Addison sleeps with his best friend, Mark Sloan. (McDreamy vs. McSteamy, remember? Both of them are now dead, unfortunately.) The affair is told over the course of a few seasons, leading to Derek’s eventual, on-and-off romance with Meredith. But how common are cheating scandals in hospitals? Common, it seems. “Worked in a place full of affairs between various staff members,” a doctor with a hidden username on Reddit wrote. “Got accused of it myself many times but was smart enough to not stick my hand in that trap.” “We had an attending who had an affair with a nurse and [he] got her pregnant,” a Chicago-based labor and delivery nurse, who chose to remain anonymous, told me. “He stayed with his wife and paid off the nurse.”  “There have been wife visits that accidentally overlap with girlfriend visits that result in security being called,” Meg added. “When the baby stroller was thrown I just walked the other way.”  The hospital atmosphere lends itself to flirtatious exchanges, the medical professionals explained, as long shifts or hours in surgery can grow dull.  “There will always be doctors who are flirty and enjoy the interaction between young nurses and them in a position of power,” Meg said. Eileen watched a good friend’s marriage fall apart due to an affair with a doctor at her hospital.   “One of my best friends was sleeping with a doctor we worked with, even though she was getting married soon after that happened. This doctor had some serious charm and tried to get in the pants of any young, attractive, female employee. It worked. On a lot of them. She even slept with him the night before her wedding,” Eileen revealed. “This continued post-wedding even though she tried to stay away. This doctor made sure he was always around and on her mind. She is now divorced and no longer has a relationship with this doctor.” “Being married can be hard. Relationships are hard,” Gunter explained. “Along the way I have met doctors who have left their spouses for other doctors or for nurses or other medical professionals. I wouldn’t call that a scandal. It’s not 1918.”  Sex isn’t the only taboo topic addressed on hospital shows. On the latest season of “Grey’s,” some of the residents accidentally eat weed cookies, and stereotypical madness ensues. We’ve also seen Amelia Shepherd (Caterina Scorsone) grapple with serious addiction issues on both “Grey’s Anatomy” and spinoff “Private Practice.” Are drugs a real issue in the medical world? Drug use is actually pretty common in hospitals, with some employees selling meds, as well.  “There are physicians with addiction issues like there are in any field,” Gunter said. According to Meg, some of her co-workers have been caught using and distributing drugs on the job.  “I know that in situations where nurses were using they were offered rehab and had strict rules to adhere to. They had to leave bedside nursing for treatment and once completed they were able to return to less stressful work in the hospital under more supervision until they were deemed ready for greater responsibility,” she said. “I think for the most part things are kept very quiet when these situations occur.” “My un-expecting co-worker was fired for stealing drugs,” Jessica said. “This happens more often than people think.”  “I live in Colorado. Most of my coworkers smoke pot, but not on the job and not before going to work,” Eileen added. “I do know of two nurses who have stolen IV and PO pain medications for themselves. I do not know if they were ever impaired while working, but they were both caught and neither will ever be a nurse again.” In Season 5 of “Grey’s,” Izzie, hallucinating thanks to a brain tumor, strikes up a romance with a ghost version of her late fiancé, the adored and never forgotten Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). (This whole storyline was reportedly concocted to give Heigl the “Emmy-worthy material” she wanted. Instead, it led some viewers, and Heigl, to quit the show.) Actually, spirits were common enough on “Grey’s,” and for the 300th episode, Shonda Rhimes brought back “ghosts” or look-alikes of Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), George O’Malley (T.R. Knight) and Izzie to bring viewers back to the early days of Seattle Grace Hospital. As chilling as it sounds, spirits do exist in hospitals, at least according to Meg.  “Sometimes monitors do weird things or you feel a tingle on the back of your neck! If you believe in spirits you have to think they are there. So many souls are departing from the hospital every day. If you can’t open the window, I have known nurses that flush the toilet to let the spirt leave!” All in all, however, the lives of doctors or nurses on medical dramas are markedly more implausible than their real-life counterparts. Most of the sources I spoke to said they don’t really watch the procedurals anymore, as the storylines are overly dramatic and fairly unrealistic. Eileen admitted, “I definitely see similarities: dealing with a patient who goes into cardiac arrest, a massive trauma, hospital overload due to a natural disaster, a gunman in the hospital. However, these are more rare than commonplace. Maybe once or twice a month I have shift as crazy as one they portray on TV.” “I think some shows do a better job,” Meg added. ”‘Nurse Jackie’ did a better job than most.” In Gunter’s opinion, “Scrubs” “got to the heart of medicine the best.” “From what I remember, I think ‘ER’ was the most accurate,” the pediatrician added. “The drama on ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ definitely was way more extreme than anything I encountered in a real hospital.” ",I,happens,Colorado
"Which was the more tragic fact reported in the New York Times Magazine’s special issue on “the persistent legacy of racism in American education”? Is it worse, as Alice Yin reports, that “81.7 percent of black students in New York City attend segregated schools (less than 10 percent white),” or should we be more appalled by the increase in segregated Southern schools? Largely because of geography, by 1972, Southern schools were the most integrated in the nation. In 1988, 43.5 percent of black students enrolled in majority-white Southern schools. By 2011, “enrollment of black students in majority-white Southern schools declined to 23.2 percent.” What are the reasons for the rise of resegregation? Nikole Hannah-Jones’ “The Resegregation of Jefferson County” makes the case that the “fight for civil rights over so many decades” reveals “the way that racism does not so much go away but adapts to the times.” The decades of Southern resistance to Brown v. Topeka was obscene. But now, why would the 88 percent white town of Gardendale, Alabama fight so hard to reject its black students, which are 25 percent of the school population? Hannah-Jones, as well as Mosi Secret’s report on segregation, can only be explained in terms of racism. However, the Times Magazine’s Mark Binelli makes us ask whether today’s resegregation is also driven by the unrestrained efforts to maximize profits on the backs of children, or whether it’s also due to the ideology of school choice. Binelli “writes about Michigan’s gamble on charter schools — and how its children lost.” Many true believers in charters blame that state’s failure on the deregulated nature of for-profit choice schools pushed by U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. And Binelli gives evidence that the profit motive increased inequality and damaged the entire state’s education system. He also provides evidence that the competition-driven culture, that isn’t limited to for-profit schools, undermined public education. Binelli writes:  In little more than a decade, Michigan has gone from being a fairly average state in elementary reading and math achievement to the bottom 10 states. It’s a devastating fall. Indeed, new national assessment data suggest Michigan is witnessing systemic decline across the K-12 spectrum. White, black, brown, higher-income, low-income — it doesn’t matter who they are or where they live.  And that brings us to more subtle questions about why segregation persists. As Binelli reports, “Charters continue to be sold in Michigan as a means of unwinding the inequality of a public-school system.” The same continues to apply to charters across the nation. Some argue that most charters are not-for-profit, even claiming that their draining off of money and the easier-to-educate students hasn’t damaged neighborhood schools. They tend to remain silent about an even more worrisome issue ― the resulting test-driven, competitive school cultures that are imposed disproportionately on poor children of color. The dubious education values articulated by Kathy Tassier, a charter’s curriculum specialist, has spread to other high-poverty schools. The Tassier acknowledged disappointing outcomes but “pointed to selective testing gains.” Binelli explains how she suggested that: The students had been motivated to “really take ownership for that growth” after learning of another local charter’s slated closure. Tassier meant the remark as a compliment. But inadvertently or not, she’d applied the language of market capitalism, of increasing productivity via brutal Darwinist competition, to a group of K-7 students. They could have been assembly-line workers being warned that the factory would close if the Chinese kept eating their lunch. If the special issue on racism and it’s legacies’ continued role in undermining public education isn’t depressing enough, it also reports on the Trump administration’s cruel attack on “Dreamers.” Even so, some corporate school reformers hope to stay their course, even though it means cooperating with DeVos and Trump. Most reformers who I know despise Trumpism and face a conundrum similar to the one that has worried me since the election. I had underestimated the persistence of racism, and now I must admit my mistake and ask whether I should view education policy differently. I wonder how many reformers are willing to face the facts about test-driven, competition-driven reform, and rethink their ideology. When reading Hannah-Jones’ previous work on school segregation, I painlessly adjusted my policy priorities, incorporating her lessons about integration and accepting the need to invest political capital in that controversial approach. I was much, much slower in altering my wider worldview, and acknowledging how pervasive racism remains. Some reformers have explicitly repudiated alliances with Trump and DeVos, but I fear that few of them will look into a deeper, darker issue. When the profit motive and extreme competitive values are unleashed on children, the resulting damage could be as persistent as other legacies. Regardless, all sides of our education civil war need to see our internal battles within the context of the travesties recounted in this amazing special magazine issue.",students,explains,closure
"People think they know Norman Rockwell, and they look for what they expect of him. But so often he presented an image that defied their expectations. He wouldn’t settle for the easy solution, the usual story line. That is why he loved to hear people’s stories of their lives, their struggles, the comic moments of relief and surprise in the midst of the drama. He searched for what was real in the illusionary world of illustration and sought a synthesis of those two disparate realities. “Party’s Over” appeared on the cover of The Saturday Evening Post on December 29, 1945 — almost four months after the long, drawn-out WWII ended, leaving an enervated nation staring into an unknown future. And with just the back of a lone waiter, Rockwell reveals so much. Instead of the predictable exhausted revelry of a group of partiers, my grandfather chooses the solitary image of one man with a small build, his shoulders somewhat collapsed in a dejected feeling about the task at hand — to clean up after the others have had their champagne, their dancing, their fill. He is separate from all the trimmings of celebration — the ribbons, hats, confetti, yet he is covered with the remnants of the night. Strangely, all the glasses and bottles of champagne and liquor are already gone, removed. He appears to be in a state ballroom or banquet hall, the regal gold curtains present a rigid, formal atmosphere in contrast to the reminders of the party’s chaos, frivolity, and perhaps rule breaking. The waiter, in his catering attire, his two-button jacket with tails, is having none of it — he has a job to do and he will do it, albeit somewhat reluctantly, the tray languishes at his side with his own stark, grey shadow reflected in it. The mirrored effect of another banquet hall adjoining this one and the light of day beckoning on the other side play with the idea of a light at the end of a tunnel. The candle lamps on the table still burn brightly. Rockwell changes his signature to suit the occasion and image, as he often did; his name runs at the bottom of the canvas — almost unnoticed — mimicking the confetti ribbons above. Of all the myriad images Pop could have chosen at the close of that tumultuous year, 1945, why did he choose this one of dejection, lethargy and solitude — of facing an unknown future without much joy, just focused on the job that needed to be attended to? That was much the state of America at that time. World War II had taken a great toll — physically, emotionally and psychically — on the American people and everyone around the world. What comes next? the country and the world unconsciously seemed to be asking. We were in uncharted territory without a map or a guide. Film Noir, that darkened period of edgy Hollywood and world cinema that arrived in the early 40’s and matured after the War, appeared on screen out of this feeling of uncertainty and the cruelty of an unknown fate — the femme fatale — that seemed beyond our control. Except we are a nation that was built on a strong and lasting vision. A vision that was born out of great difficulty and carnage — we are still a young country in comparison to the rest of the world — but a powerful vision that remains within us inherently without our prompting. And that is the continuing vision that Norman Rockwell was often able to capture in his almost 60 years as an illustrator, as our nation began to grow up, stumble, fall back, and pick itself up again and again with renewed vision and vigor. This is who we were and who we are and will always be. A nation that will aspire, achieve, overstep, make errors, rectify itself, and begin again stronger and hopefully wiser. That is our essence as a nation. And it is the essence of Pop’s vision of America and its continuing progress technologically, emotionally and spiritually. We can’t have the peace on earth we are seeking right now. Yet we can begin to find that peace within ourselves, our lives, and the life around us. That is how we regrow and expand the original vision for this country and our world. Nothing can happen without that profound and powerful vision. And we need to hold fast to that always evolving dream, now more than ever. Our faith is not tested in periods of prosperity and pockets of time spent in blissful serenity. Our faith is made real in times of crisis, unknowing and disquiet. Those are the moments that reveal who we truly are, not who we hope to be or wish we were. May 2017 be the year that marks the beginning of the great healing for our nation and the world, a year when even the smallest wishes peek through to see the light of day. Sometimes true healing only comes after the greatest crisis point is reached. That is why people continue to be drawn to the affirmative message of Rockwell. We know it is possible. And till our last breath we will breathe and live that truth with determination and grit because that is who we know we are and are struggling to become.

" Too many respond to increased competition by lowering prices. The problem is that lowering the price often comes with unintended consequences. It can lower the image of your product and send the wrong message to customers that recently paid more. What is a company to do? The answer is set the price at the right level by finding out what buyers are willing to pay. What buyers are willing to pay

Pricing novices tend to be ""inside-out"" thinkers. They assume that buyers always want to pay less because they, themselves (inside their own heads), want to pay less. What the data shows is that this is true if the product is validated. If you know and trust the company and the product you are buying, of course, you would like to buy it for less. What if the product is not validated? You never heard of the company, or you have never heard of the product. Time and again, a lower price for an unknown product from an unknown company usually means one thing to the buyer's brain - the product is probably not very good. What gives you control over the price Economists tell you that the market determines the price, and that an economic price is where supply equals demand. Rather than fight with economists, good Marketers know that positioning (product branding) gives you control over the price. The more uniqueness and desirability you put into your positioning strategy, the more control you have over the price you can charge for your product. A few examples should help to illustrate how positioning gives you this control.  Once you understand that positioning gives you control over the price, you are ready to develop pricing strategies to help your sales and profits. Pricing is more complex than you think.   Pricing is one of the fundamental building blocks of marketing. Many believe price is easy to understand when, in fact, it is one of the most difficult. McKinsey points out in an article entitled Shedding the Commodity Mind-set, too many companies leave large amounts of money on the table. Pricing experts know that setting the right price is difficult because, in addition to the physical factors of cost and profit, price is subject to psychological factors. The best companies can do to have control over these psychological factors is to do a great job of branding. And to get the branding right, companies have to know how to develop the right underlying corporate image and positioning strategies. In short, creating a brand image of the product that is impossible, or extremely difficult, to copy is the key to having control over your pricing strategies. If you are able to do that, you will be able to employ the most powerful and effective of all pricing strategies - What The Market Will Bear (WTMWB).  What the Market Will Bear In markets where there is little or no competition, companies can employ a pricing strategy that optimizes profits. It is often called a What The Market Will Bear (WTMWB) price. This strategy sets the price based on the maximum price the market will pay for the product. On the one hand, the company wants to realize the highest profits possible in the shortest amount of time to help recoup high start-up costs, such R&D (research and development), production, and marketing costs. On the other, it may not want its profits to be so attractive as to entice cutthroat competition to enter the market within the time window it needs to build market share and establish a leadership position. This strategy typically works because those likely to buy a new product - the Innovators and Early Adopters - are not particularly price sensitive. If there is considerable uniqueness and desirability built into the product brand, your company can employ a WTMWB strategy. If not, you might consider other effective pricing strategies. Gross Profit Margin Target When I develop pricing strategies for a client that is a manufacturer, I always start with a GPMT pricing strategy that is twice their cost, or 2C, since that is an easy calculation that will give them their GPMT of 50%. Most Significant Digit Pricing For products that will be sold to consumers, most companies employ a Most Significant Digit (MSD) pricing strategy. Why? Studies and experience show that sales will be significantly higher if a product is priced at say $29.95 or $29.99 instead of $30. Most humans focus on the most significant digit - the ""2"" in this case. To them $29.95 or $29.99 seems a lot less than $30 even though it is only 1 to 5¢ less. Even expensive homes in Beverly Hills might sell for $7,995,000 rather than $8 million. There are exceptions. In upscale restaurants, it is usually a mistake to price an entrée at $31.95. Instead it will be priced at $32-. For some reason, people do not think the food is as good if MSD pricing is used in a high-end restaurant. Combining all three If a product is positioned as unique, smart marketing companies will typically use all three of these strategies in combination. For example, Apple has priced its iPad Air and iPad Pro starting at $399 and $599 respectively. Apple is using a MSD strategy in addition to a WTMWB strategy because the iPhone has uniqueness built-in since Apple controls the platform. It also aims for a GPMT, which is not officially published, but which is in the 30 to 50% GPM range of well-positioned products in competitive markets. When Johnson & Johnson launched a margarine developed in Finland that lowers cholesterol, it priced a tub of this margarine at between $5.79 and $5.99. At the same time, a tub of regular margarine sold for 99¢. Based on this pricing, which used MSD and WTMWB strategies, many speculated that J&J priced the product at 8C, which gave it a GPMT of roughly 87.5%. Pricing your products When you are pricing your products, what gives you control over the price is the uniqueness and desirability built into your positioning, or branding, strategy. If you have created a product image that is impossible, or very difficult, to copy, you can employ a WTMWB price that will give you a good GPM that enables you to achieve your desired GPMT. And, if you sell your product in a consumer market, it would be a good idea to also employ an MSD pricing strategy. For example, if you are a manufacturer that is targeting a GPM of 50% and your cost of sales is $15, you might consider selling the product for $29.99 - a penny less than the price of 2C, which would give you a 50% gross profit margin.

"Donald Trump’s longtime personal lawyer convinced major corporations to pay into his shell company by promising access to the president, according to one firm that doled out the cash. Shortly before Trump became president, Michael Cohen set up Essential Consultants LLC, a shell firm that eventually paid porn star Stormy Daniels to stay quiet in the run-up to the 2016 election about her alleged affair with the president. But this week, it was revealed that the financiers for Cohen’s company included major corporations, including Korea Aerospace Industries, the pharmaceutical company Novartis and AT&T. Significantly, it also received money from Columbus Nova, a New York investment firm with close ties to billionaire Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, who has been questioned by special counsel Robert Mueller.  The payments were significant. Novartis paid $1.2 million for “healthcare policy matters.” KAI said it needed help on U.S. accounting standards, and Columbus Nova said it paid a “consulting fee” that had nothing to do with Vekselberg.  AT&T, in a memo to staff Wednesday, explained that it needed to “understand” how the Trump administration would approach issues like tax reform and antitrust regulations. It portrayed paying into the shell company of a president’s personal lawyer as routine: “Companies often hire consultants for these purposes, especially at the beginning of a new Presidential Administration, and we have done so in previous Administrations, as well.” But an official with one of those companies, who requested anonymity to speak openly, was more blunt. The official said Cohen “was promising access to Trump and members of the administration, positioning himself as a lobbyist.” One big question surrounding this controversy is how the companies came to know about Cohen and his shell company.  A Novartis employee told STAT, a news outlet that covers health and medicine, that Cohen reached out to them. His promise of access was enticing because the company was “trying to find an inroad into the administration” ― which tended to have fewer people known in Washington political circles.  But apparently, Cohen proved to be a disappointment. In a statement, Novartis said it entered into its one-year agreement with Cohen in February 2017. In March, it had its first meeting with him.  “Following this initial meeting,” the statement read, “Novartis determined that Michael Cohen and Essential Consultants would be unable to provide the services that Novartis had anticipated related to US healthcare policy matters and the decision was taken not to engage further.” KAI paid Cohen’s firm $150,000, Columbus Nova paid $500,000 and AT&T gave $600,000.  Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s new personal lawyer, told HuffPost on Wednesday that the Cohen news has absolutely nothing to do with the president. “There’s not involvement of the president in any of that,” he said. “We can’t be responsible for what Michael Cohen is doing.” S.V. Date contributed reporting. This article has been updated with more recently reported figures for the amount paid to Cohen by AT&T.

"Lou Anna Simon resigned on Wednesday after 13 years as president of Michigan State University in the wake of a massive sexual assault scandal involving the disgraced sports team doctor Larry Nassar.  Calls for Simon to step down began with reports that MSU administration officials and law enforcement knew about Nassar’s behavior and failed to stop him. Following Nassar’s sentencing for sex crimes on Wednesday, a source told the MSU student newspaper, The State News, that Simon would step down from her position by Friday.  Simon posted her resignation announcement on the school’s website, where she addressed the statements of Nassar’s victims and the long justice process. She also minimized her role and previous knowledge of accusations against Nassar in 2014.  “As tragedies are politicized, blame is inevitable. As president, it is only natural that I am the focus of this anger,” Simon wrote. “I understand, and that is why I have limited my personal statements.” The former university president wrote about her work at MSU and her desire to put the university first.  “I urge those who have supported my work to understand that I cannot make it about me now,” Simon continued. “Therefore, I am tendering my resignation as president according to the terms of my employment agreement.” Earlier in the week, Joel Ferguson, vice chairman of the MSU board of trustees, said that Simon, whom he described as a good fundraiser, would not resign. Ferguson added that the university had more going on “than just this Nassar thing.”  Nassar was once a respected physician employed by both the university and USA Gymnastics, which is also facing fierce criticism over its failure to do something about the serial abuser long ago. Because he was known for treating Olympic athletes, Nassar’s patients felt pressured to accept that his inappropriate, ungloved touch was legitimate medical care. Simon told the Detroit News that she knew about the abuse allegations in 2014 ― two years before Nassar was fired by the school ― when a Title IX complaint and a police report were filed. School police investigated, but allowed Nassar to keep seeing patients. At least two student athletes had previously voiced complaints about him to university staff. She said in her resignation that she’d planned to retire in December 2016, but decided against it when the Indianapolis Star broke the story of the allegations that year.  “I told people to play it straight up, and I did not receive a copy of the report. That’s the truth,” Simon told the News. The same article said that more than a dozen MSU staffers knew about the accusations of abuse and did nothing.  It’s clear that it’s in the best interest of these courageous survivors, their families, and our State for President Lou Anna Simon to resign. Michigan’s two senators, Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, called for Simon to resign on Wednesday. Both Democrats are alumni of the university.  Peters released a statement in which he emphasized the need for new leadership as MSU has a “long way to go in rebuilding trust.”  More than 150 young women said Nassar had molested them, including one girl who was just 6 at the time. Sometimes, they said, he even abused them when their parents were in the room during medical treatments. On Jan. 24, Nassar was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison after 169 survivors and family members spent a week reading statements in court about the impact his abuse has had on their lives. One of his former patients died by suicide; her mother read a statement on her behalf. The father of another girl Nassar abused killed himself, and his daughter suspects it was partly out of guilt because he didn’t initially believe her story. Nassar, 54, previously received a 60-year sentence for possession of child pornography and is expected to spend the rest of his life behind bars. A post shared by The State News (@statenews) on Jan 18, 2018 at 7:47am PST Many of the women who read statements in Judge Rosemarie Aquilina’s Lansing, Michigan, courtroom blamed MSU and USA Gymnastics for failing to act sooner. Several USA Gymnastics officials resigned prior to Nassar’s sentencing. In an open-letter apology to the Team USA victims, the U.S. Olympic Committee also pledged to launch a third-party investigation into who enabled Nassar to commit his abuses for so long.  MSU faculty called for a vote of no confidence in the school’s leadership this week, while the student newspaper ran a front page demanding that Simon resign. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette plans to open an investigation into MSU’s role in the scandal. The NCAA also announced that it would open an investigation into the university’s athletic department. “Since my first day on the job as athletic director, my focus has always been on the student-athlete,” MSU Athletic Director Mark Hollis told HuffPost in a statement. “They are at the core of our athletic department mission statement. Our first priority has always been and will always be their health and safety. In regards to the letter we received from the NCAA last night, the athletic compliance and university general counsel offices are preparing a comprehensive response. Michigan State University will cooperate with any investigation.” Nick Visser contributed reporting. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated that the girl whose father killed himself had been a patient of Nassar. In fact, she was a family friend. Language has also been updated to clarify that she believed her father’s suicide partly stemmed from guilt at not initially believing her story.",officials,began,him
"Throughout this past year, we have been witnessing something remarkable— an active energy, a renewed force of nature coming to the surface. It is women: courageous, motivated, hurting, angry, concerned, resolute. Women of all backgrounds, ages, races and experiences, rising up everywhere to use their voices, speak their truths, and demand change. Whether marching at the Women’s March or stepping up by the tens of thousands to run for office, or courageously sharing their stories of harassment and assault with #metoo, women are newly engaged and energized in increasing numbers, and we are rising—to share our stories, articulate our outrage, advocate for our concerns and our planet, and share our visions and dreams for a more equal, just and harmonious world. It was no surprise to me, then, covering this year’s TEDWomen conference at the Orpheum Theater in New Orleans, to see that the stand-out messages in many of the talks were focused on women overcoming fears, getting comfortable with being uncomfortable and speaking truth to power.  The TEDWomen conference—a part of TED, the nonprofit devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading—is committed to being a forum that offers a high-profile platform for women of diverse backgrounds, perspectives and professions to share their stories and visions. This was the 7th year of TEDWomen, the concept for which was spearheaded by media pioneer Pat Mitchell, and grew out of what she identified as a void that needed to be filled after she talked to TED founder Chris Anderson back in 2008 about the fact that women made up “less than 20% of the TED talks online and on the TED stage.” Mitchell offered to help Anderson find female speakers for what she thought at the time would only be a one-time conference in 2010. Now, seven years later, due to its popularity and success, TEDWomen is still going strong. The theme of this year’s conference was “Bridges."" I asked Mitchell how she chose this year’s theme, and she told me, ""This theme  seemed to respond to a time when the divides between people, cultures, races,  genders and countries never seemed wider. We wanted to deliver ideas about how  we build bridges of understanding, design ways to connect again, suspend our own  opinions and beliefs to listen to others, and rebuild relationships, personal  and collective.”  The event featured a live program of more than 40 speakers and performers over three days, and was broadcasted to more than 200 simultaneous TEDxWomen events held in more than 60 countries in 160 cities around the world. The diverse speakers presented from the worlds of entrepreneurship, innovation, science, art, activism, business, civil society and more.  One of the much-anticipated talks, which Mitchell said was booked long before the Harvey Weinstein story broke and sexual harassment was back in the headlines, was Gretchen Carlson, who was one of the first women to step forward back in 2016 with her harassment claims against former FOX News network head Roger Ailes. Mitchell said that it was fortuitous timing for Carlson’s talk and that she hopes that we are “at a game changing moment.” In Carlson’s TEDWomen talk (which you can view here), she told her story and identified three specific things we can all do to create safer places to work. Said Carlson during her talk, ""We will no longer be underestimated, intimidated or set back. We will stand up and speak up and have our voices heard. We will be the women we were meant to be."" To herald the moment that we are in, I decided to interview a few of this year’s amazing TEDWomen speakers for their advice and encouragement for women to be brave, overcome their fears and speak truth to power in order to be our full selves, advocate for the causes we care about and contribute to positive change. I also reached out to a male speaker, actor and proud feminist Justin Baldoni, (whose talk you can view here) who challenged men to redefine masculinity by being “brave enough to be vulnerable” and “strong enough to be sensitive.”  Here is a sampling of some of the wisdom that was shared with me during those interviews (and stay tuned for the full roster of inspiring TEDWomen talks to go online, which will appear on TED.com in the coming weeks and months).  In alphabetical order: Luvvie Ajayi, Justin Baldoni, Susan David, Sally Kohn. “Being yourself can be a revolutionary act. In a world that wants us to whisper, I choose to yell.” Luvvie Ajayi is an award-winning author, speaker and digital strategist who thrives at the intersection of comedy, technology and activism. A fourteen-year blogging veteran, she is the voice behind Awesomely Luvvie, a widely-respected humor blog that covers everything from TV, movies and technology to travel, race and life’s random adventures. It was her blog that inspired Luvvie’s debut book set to release November 21st, I’M JUDGING YOU: The Do-Better Manual, which instantly hit the New York Times best-seller’s list.  A self-proclaimed professional troublemaker, Luvvie tamed her fears by conquering them in the boldest ways possible—deep-sea diving, skydiving and ziplining across forests. In her talk (which you can view here), she encouraged others to do the same, to be the first domino causing a chain reaction. She said, “There are too few people willing to be the domino, to serve as a catalyst by doing or saying what is difficult.” Marianne Schnall: You gave such inspiring talk about overcoming your own fears. How does one conjure up the courage to be the domino, to be the first and to say the things we think not to say? Luvvie Ayaji: There is no one way to do that. I think it just comes from knowing, acknowledging the fact that it is scary but then kind of taking a deep breath, swallowing hard and just doing whatever that is anyway. There is no easy way—just do it. It’s just one of those things that comes with fortitude of like, “Okay, I have to do it. So I am just going to acknowledge the fact that this is how I am feeling about it, but it is not going to stop me.” MS: You spoke a lot about you know that there are too few people willing to take that fall in terms of speaking up and being the first. Why do you feel that right now it is so important that everybody, in particular women, do this right now? What are the stakes that you see?  LA: What’s at stake are our basic rights and the things that we hold dear. I don’t think we can afford to be silent anymore. Where before we could probably be like, “Yeah, I guess I will be quiet because I might lose something,” I think now we have way more to lose than we realize. So that’s what is at stake, like the fact that now people are even discussing Roe vs. Wade where that might even be called to back into debate. So, yeah, I think it is expensive to be quiet sometimes, I think it costs us more to be quiet than it does to speak up. MS: What would you say to women—who as girls are often groomed to please and be liked and not make trouble—about how to not worry about what other people think as you speak your truth?  LA: You can’t please everybody, so you might as well just speak the truth. That’s all your job is: to speak the truth. If nothing else because at least you know that you were authentic to yourself, and at the end of the day you have to basically answer to yourself, not anybody else. MS: What one message are you hoping to convey through your talk and in your work generally right now?  LA: I am really trying to encourage people to do what feels scary… encouraging people to just tell the truth. “Fellas, we are the problem. And if we want to be part of the solution, then words are no longer enough.” Justin Baldoni is an actor, producer, director, and CEO of Wayfarer Entertainment. Best known for his role as Rafael Solano on the CW’s hit show, Jane the Virgin, he is also the moderator of the new show Man Enough, a weekly dinner party that brings together some of the most recognizable faces from Hollywood to have deep (and sometimes uncomfortable) conversations about what it means to be a man today. In his talk, “Why I’m done trying to be ‘man enough’” (which can be viewed here), Justin invited men to reject traditional norms of masculinity, to be accountable for and conscious of their actions—and to be vulnerable, express emotions, and disrupt the patriarchy. He asks, “Men, are you brave enough to be vulnerable? Strong enough to be sensitive?”  Marianne Schnall: You said that men have to “be brave enough to be vulnerable,” so literally overcoming fear and having courage for men is to be vulnerable and go against gender norms. Can you talk a little bit about that? Justin Baldoni: I have to brave enough to be vulnerable and open up, and I think that we completely forget that bravery isn't just something that is outside of us, it's also inside of us and we can use it to go inside of ourselves. I think it takes a lot of strength to be sensitive, it takes strength to be willing to show your cards, to be willing to cry when you are hurting or when you are happy. Because it takes strength to be okay with not caring what someone is going to actually think of you, that they see you weak when someone in your family dies or when you are struggling with something. It's strong to be able to hold those things, but we don’t teach our children that and we don’t teach our boys that, we don’t teach our men that. We just teach our boys that girls cry and boys suck it up, and then all that happens is we don’t ever learn to express ourselves. I think there is this misconception and it starts when we are kids. And it's ingrained in our psyche and in our culture, and I think that we just really need to be mindful of the way we talk about ourselves and our own qualities. As boys we start repressing those things because that makes us weak, so what ends up happening is we start repressing all of those things and then one day it's just the dam that has to explode and it either explodes in depression or it explodes in a breakdown emotionally or it explodes in rage. Because we all know that rage and anger are really the emotions that young boys are told they are allowed to feel. I think men that come forward and talk about their struggles and their depression are brave, men that go see a therapist are brave, men that are willing to confess their fears to their wife are brave—there are different levels of bravery that I think it's okay that we start talking about and rewarding and supporting and acknowledging in men. MS: What was your own journey in terms of having to redefine your own sense of masculinity, and why you think this is so important for men right now? JB: I just remember feeling so much emotion as a young man and as a young boy from whatever situation I was in, whether it was hearing boys make fun of other boys or getting bullied myself. But I was taught that I shouldn’t feel those emotions, let alone express them, because those emotions made me “girly.” So at a very young age I had to kind of put on this tough exterior, this mask of masculinity. I mean, even the root word of masculinity means it's like a mask. So I put that on as a young boy and then teenager, not allowing myself to feel or at least to show that I felt anything. And when I hit my late twenties, I started to look at myself and ask, Who am I? Who am I really? I found that the behaviors that I had developed as a young man weren’t serving me anymore because I was doing and saying things that weren't true to myself, to my core. I was treating women in the way that really wasn’t how I wanted to treat them but was how I was told that I should treat them if I want a certain results. And none of it was working for me. I found myself lonely, isolated, unable to express the things I wanted to express, my work suffered. So all of these behaviors and all these things, I just started recognizing them in myself. It just came down to, well, let me just start to figure out who I am and just kind of rebuild myself. And then the more I learned about feminism, the more I realized, well I guess I'm a feminist because I believe in equality. In feminism, women are fighting for equality, but the reason they are fighting is because men are fighting back. So to me it was like, well then I need to talk to the men, and if I'm having these issues, I wonder if other boys and other men are having these issues and maybe there is a chance that if we can affect young boys and young men and create a new generation of men that are willing to talk about these things and open up and share their feelings, and by sheer by accident we can create a new generation. MS: What got you started on this path of speaking out about these issues of masculinity? JB: What kind of got me started was Jane the Virgin. I ended up on a show that was a feminist show, I got a certain kind of group of fans that started following me, and I started sharing what I cared about, which was my family and my love for my wife and when my daughter was born and talking about equality for women, and then realized I wanted to talk about redefining masculinity.  And then so many of the women following me started saying I was perfect and started saying they wanted to clone me, and when I hear that it bothers me because I’m flawed, I’m not perfect. So every time I hear this it makes my work that much more meaningful because I want to go reach other men. There are so many men out there who are better men than I am, who are more in touch with their hearts and more in touch with their vulnerability and that sensitive side, and those men need a voice and need a platform. So I really hope that they start coming out of the woodwork and that women can start recognizing that they also exist. MS: What drives you to keep doing this work?  JB: I’m just trying to figure out how I can keep going and how I'm going to affect the hearts of young boys and men and even women around the world by letting them all know that they are enough. They are enough as they are. They don’t have to be anybody else, they don’t have to be like that guy or like that woman, they don’t have to act that way if that’s not who they feel they are in their core. They don’t have to push away their emotions just because it makes them look weak. And in fact, if we can start to redefine what that means and teach young boys that their emotions are actually their strength, their vulnerability is their power, there is a really good chance that we can create a big difference in the world. That’s what drives me. “Courage is not the absence of fear. Courage is fear walking.” Susan David, Ph.D., is an award-winning Psychologist on the faculty of Harvard Medical School; co-founder and co-director of the Institute of Coaching at McLean Hospital; and CEO of Evidence Based Psychology, a boutique business consultancy. She is the author of the new #1 Wall Street Journal best-selling book Emotional Agility based on her concept that Harvard Business Review heralded as a Management Idea of the Year.  In her talk, she says that how we deal with our inner world drives everything. Every aspect of how we love, how we live, parent and lead is influenced by our emotional agility, how well we approach our emotions with curiosity, courage and compassion. But we need to strip away the toxic rigidity of categorizing emotions as overwhelmingly good or bad, pushing away the “bad” ones or pretending they don’t exist. Tough emotions are a part of our contract with life, she says. It’s up to us to handle them and ourselves with mercy and grace. Marianne Schnall: Why is it so important that we learn to deal with and be open to our difficult emotions like fear, anger and sadness, and how can we learn to do this for ourselves and for our children when we are not given the support and tools to do so? Susan David: It’s critical because our emotions are the call signaling function that we as human being have at our disposal. Emotions often taught us things to help us communicate with other people, but in fact a core aspect of our emotions is that they help us to communicate with ourselves. So often when we feel in dissonance with something, when we feel disconnected with something, those are the kinds of things that we have emotions about. As I said in my talk, we tend to have strong emotions about things we care about, so when you aren’t open to your emotions, what you’re doing is basically cutting off from yourself the key resource that is actually there and available to help you to understand yourself better in the world.  And a key thing that emotions give us they help to signal our values. Our emotions are flashing lights to our values. If you are sitting reading the news and you feel anger rise inside you, often that anger is a sign, like, “Gee, you know, I am worried about issues of equity or fairness.” Or if you’re feeling guilty as a parent, you know often that’s a signpost that presence and connectedness is really important to you.  The value that emotions bring is our values, quite literally, which is that if we slow down, if we open ourselves up to them, our emotions are a core resource that help us to shape our lives effectively. MS: When we live in a world that tells us that the main goal is to just be positive and be okay, how can we become more comfortable with our difficult emotions? SD: A very, very important way to first and foremost start learning from emotions is to end the struggle that we have with our emotions, quite literally by dropping the rope. What I mean by this is our social and cultural expectations create almost a tug-of-war within us around our emotions, where we’re constantly going backwards and forwards as to whether we should feel something or we shouldn’t, we’re allowed or not allowed, whether it’s a good emotion or bad emotion. We have a choice of showing our emotions and ending the judgment that we have about our emotions. And it’s difficult, it’s not an easy thing to do, but often there is a level of choice in saying, “I am not going to second guess myself anymore, I am not going to judge myself. This is what I am feeling.” MS: One of the lines from your talk that was re-tweeted and went viral was when you said, “Courage is not the absence of fear; courage is fear walking.” What did you mean by that? SD: If we are waiting for our fear to abate, if we’re waiting for the fear to go away for us to do the stuff that’s important, we’re never going to step up, we’re never going to stand up. We cannot wait for fear to go away because it’s like waiting for breathing to go away, it’s like waiting for thinking to go away—these are core human parts of us. So really what I meant is that courage is not the absence of fear, it’s not about not feeling fear, it’s not about conquering fear—it’s about having the capacity to notice your fear, to notice it with compassion because you’re feeling fearful about something and something that matters to you. So we want to notice our fear with compassion. We want to notice our fear with curiosity: What is this fear trying to say to me. What is it specifically that I am scared of here? What is this fear trying to tell me? So courage is about being able to notice our fear with curiosity and with compassion and still choose to take steps in the direction of our values. MS: What are the wider implications for the world of a more emotionally resilient people and society? What would that look like? SD: We know that we are reaching levels of social change, gender change, equity, more value-based ways of being, not when we are not feeling fear but when we’re taking steps in the direction of our values, and that often feels fearful and that’s normal. “Hate is in all of us and we can see it when we think we hold the moral ground over another.” Sally Kohn is a CNN political commentator and columnist, and is currently working on a book about hate—why there’s so much hate in our world today, why it’s getting worse, and what we can do to stop it. The Opposite of Hate will be published in the Spring of 2018. In her talk, she admits that in grade school she mercilessly bullied another kid, with cruel words that stayed fresh in her mind long after every other fact about fifth grade was forgotten. That memory, along with a noticeable increase in recent hateful thoughts in the world at large, made her question how she thought of herself: “What if I wasn’t a nice person at all, but really just a hateful monster?” She began to ask questions and set out to understand this early episode of bullying in her life within the broader context of hate and its growing influence in the world. Marianne Schnall: One of the big things that I think is so important that your talk underscored was overcoming the fear of the “other” and getting comfortable with being uncomfortable. What advice do you have in terms of learning to have conversations with people who may appear or believe differently than us, and why do you think especially right now learning to do that is important? Sally Kohn: To be honest, it was always important. If your critique is that the other side doesn’t listen, understand, connect enough, that literally is a two way street. You can’t just say, hey, they don’t understand us. They don’t listen to us. They don’t connect to us. You do have to recognize that you may in fact play a part in that as well and that it’s not just on those proverbial others to relate to you, but vice versa. MS: What advice do you have on having productive conversations with people who you may have different values and see things differently that don’t lead to just some of a shouting match? SK: The first thing is kind of a philosophical approach, which is to understand that people who disagree with you are not necessarily your enemy. And the truth is that I’ve met a lot of extreme people who extremely disagree with me in very vocal and vociferous ways, and I can still find more I agree with them on than we disagree on. We happen to have a society in general, and a media environment in particular, that hones in on those areas of disagreement and makes them feel magnified. But we still love our kids. We still want our family and people around us and everyone in the world to be safe. We still don’t understand why everyone watches Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and yet when it’s on we can’t look away. You know, we have all these things in common. Even my closest friends, I don’t see eye to eye with them on everything. But I have sort of a well-honed habit of focusing on the things we agree on or the ways in which we’re alike or the ways in which we’re connected. Why don’t I do that with the people on the “other side?” MS: You have experience in terms of getting up there and be able to speak out even knowing that you might get some push back or trolls or the haters out there. What advice do you have and what is your way of dealing with that sort of backlash, that is just going to come naturally with when we do forcefully speak our minds as women? SK: We’re seeing right now what happens when not only we women speak out on an individual level, but the power of community, the power of many voices. And the truths about sexual assault, sexual harassment that had been buried for so long—not just because women had strong reasons to not speak out, but because of patriarchy and misogyny. Those kinds of massive institutions of injustice and habits of injustice don’t topple because we kind of hope they will. It happens when we all come together, speak up, support those who do, sometimes yell really loudly as a group. Women and men, using their voices collectively for justice. And I think certainly in recent history, this was one of the most profound examples, the way we’re seeing day after day after day the ripple effects what happens when more women speak out, speak out together and act to make change. We’re seeing how incredibly powerful and persuasive that is. MS: How can we learn to advocate for the causes we care about without inadvertently spreading more negativity, more hate and division, especially while there is so much kind of resist and protest energy? How can we do that while simultaneously modeling this more loving and harmonious world that we want to represent and not by creating more division or hate in the world? SK: We do tend to think that other people are hateful. And what’s more—what I came to realize is—we hate them for it! So we literally hate this group of people or that group of people because we think they’re just so hateful, and we don’t think we’re hateful, even though we’re literally hating them. And there are all kinds of physiological phenomena for this and research that proves this: the inability of human beings or our disinclination as human beings to see our own stuff and yet very accurately critique and label it in others. I mean we can’t even have a real discussion about hate if we can’t see that we’re all implicated, all involved, all part of the problem. It doesn’t mean it’s all the same. But hate is hate. And there’s a bit of a sanctimony issue that we need to step away from and start to face our own issues head on if we’re then going to have a real conversation about others.

"A standoff at a veterans home in Yountville, California, ended Friday night with the deaths of three female employees and the gunman who took them hostage, the California Highway Patrol said. Police identified the shooter as Albert Wong, a military veteran they said was armed with a high-powered rifle. The gunman stormed the Veterans Home of California-Yountville in Napa County midmorning Friday during a farewell party for an employee. He exchanged gunfire with a Napa County sheriff’s deputy, then took three hostages into a room, where he stayed throughout the day. The others in the building fled. The victims have been identified as Jennifer Golick, 42; Jennifer Gonzalez, 29, and Christine Loeber, 48. Hostage negotiators were never able to contact Wong, 36, as law enforcement officers and a SWAT team circled the veterans home. Officers finally entered the building about 6 p.m. local time and found the four bodies, Chris Childs, assistant captain of the California Highway Patrol, said at a news conference late Friday. “This is a tragic piece of news, one that we were really hoping we wouldn’t have to come before the public to give,” Childs said. Childs thanked the deputy who confronted the gunman and prevented him from “going out and finding other victims.” The deputy was not injured. Officers found the gunman’s rental car nearby, and a police dog indicated there may have been an explosive inside. “We found a cellphone, not a bomb,” Childs said.  He did not say what kind of gun the shooter used or give a time of death for the gunman and the hostages. Authorities were reaching out to family members of the victims late Friday. California state Sen. Bill Dodd (D) told reporters that the gunman was a participant in The Pathway Home, an independently run program on Veterans Home grounds that works with veterans who have post-traumatic stress disorder. The gunman was apparently “a veteran who served in the Middle East and has PTSD,” Dodd told ABC News. The man had been in the program since last year but had been asked to leave earlier this week, Dodd said. All of the victims had reportedly worked with the shooter in the Pathway program. The standoff began after the county sheriff’s office responded to a call about 10:30 a.m. when a gunman walked into a party hosted by The Pathway Home. Larry Kamer said his wife, Devereaux Smith, was one of about 10 to 15 people at the party when the gunman came in, according to The Associated Press. The gunman reportedly allowed everyone, including Smith, to leave except for the three people he took as hostages. “Potentially” 30 shots were heard being fired, Veterans Home spokesman Joshua Kisser told HuffPost. SWAT teams on scene of #Yountville veterans home shooting. LIVE VIDEO: https://t.co/0qyCtycosx pic.twitter.com/xOp5G2BQSW The Veterans Home is built on roughly 600 acres, making it the largest veterans home in the U.S., Kisser said. The facility, about an hour north of San Francisco, is home to about 1,000 retired service members.  Jan Thornton, 51, said her father is a World War II veteran who lives in the skilled nursing section of the facility. She said staff immediately locked down the buildings, along with individual rooms, upon reports of an active shooter Friday morning.  “I called my dad’s friend [who lives there] right away, because my dad has dementia and I didn’t want to panic him,” Thornton said, adding that her father was safe. Brian Goder, a 59-year-old Air Force veteran who has lived at the Veterans’ Home for a little over two years, said he was walking to the dining hall when he was put on lockdown. “As I was walking, people kept yelling ‘Sir! Sir!’ to me,” Goder told HuffPost. “I turned around and there were probably about a dozen police officers with ARs running past me.” Ground and air ambulances were initially staged near the Veterans Home, police said. Police also cleared out the nearby Vintners Golf Club, which is open to the public. “My poor dad,” Thornton said. “He saw enough of this at war. He doesn’t need to see this at home.” Sarah Ruiz-Grossman contributed reporting. ",I,called,friend
"President Trump believes that Federal regulation is excessive and has directed that task forces be set up at each Federal agency to supervise and monitor the process of finding regulations to cut. To my knowledge, he has not provided any guidance to the agencies on how to do this, so I decided to do it for him in this article.  Step 1: Define the Objective: Counting the number of regulations is useless, what matters is whether the objectives of regulation are being achieved. Regulation is excessive when it does not accomplish its objective, or when the cost of accomplishing the objective through regulation is excessive, or when there is an alternative to regulation that is less costly. The objectives vary from agency to agency. My interest is in financial regulation. This includes the market for home mortgages, which I will use for my illustrations. The agencies with regulatory responsibilities in this market include HUD/FHA, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I will illustrate with two objectives, both of which are designed to empower the “little guy.” 1.    Reduce barriers to effective mortgage shopping. 2.    Reduce mortgage transactions costs. Step 2:  Identify Remediable Deficiencies The major focus of the agencies in assessing their regulations should be to identify the major deficiencies that are preventing their objectives from being realized.  For the mortgage-related agencies, Step 2 would include the following deficiencies bearing on the two objectives cited above. 1.  Lender control of appraisals makes them non-portable and lengthens transaction periods, both of which impede the ability of borrowers to shop effectively. 2.  The cost of title insurance paid by borrowers is excessive relative to the costs incurred in assessing the validity of titles. Step 3: Assess Existing and Alternative Regulations I will illustrate with the two objectives and deficiencies cited above. The Difficulty in Shopping: The core problem potential borrowers face in shopping for a mortgage is that critically important information bearing on its price, including the value of the property, is not available to them until after they have applied for a loan and paid for an appraisal. For a borrower to withdraw at this point in order to begin again with another lender is difficult, costly and time-consuming, so few do it. Relevant Existing Regulations: The regulations applicable to appraisals are a major source of the problem. While borrowers pay for appraisals, the regulations place responsibility and control with lenders, who order them after a borrower has applied. This lengthens the period the borrower must wait for the information needed to shop, and it also means that the borrower who withdraws from the process must pay for a new appraisal and wait out the results once again. A Better Regulatory Approach: If regulations obliged lenders to accept an appraisal ordered by a borrower from any approved appraisal management company, the borrower would at last have the capacity to shop for the best deal. With an appraisal in hand, the shopper could invite multiple lenders to make a firm offer at a specified date and time. Making appraisals portable is one of the simplest and most effective ways to empower consumers. Bringing that about would require replacement of one set of regulations with another set. The Excessive Price of Title Insurance: Assuring good title is necessary for an effective housing and mortgage market, but title insurance is not necessary for that purpose. Denmark has a reliable system of recording titles but no title insurance. Relevant Existing Law: Existing law allows lenders to shift to the borrower the cost of title insurance that protects the lender. This prevents the efficient application of existing technology that would reduce the cost of assuring good titles to a small fraction of the cost of title insurance. The problem is that lenders have no financial incentive to shift to a more efficient system – in fact, many have a financial interest in the title agencies to which they refer customers. A Better Regulatory Approach: If the law required lenders to pay for title insurance themselves, passing the cost to the borrower in the price of the mortgage, lenders would have an incentive to drive down the cost rather than to share in the revenue. The result would be a precipitous decline in the cost of title insurance, and eventually the replacement of the industry with an automated system open to all market participants. If this new and very simple regulation applied to mortgage insurance as well as title insurance, which should be the case, it would make a large set of existing regulations obsolete. These are the regulations that apply to referral fees, which deal with such weighty matters as whether a birthday present from a title agent or a mortgage insurance salesperson, to a lender, constitutes a prohibited referral fee. Good riddance. Concluding Comment The President says he wants to reduce the number of regulations.  I interpret that to mean that he wants to replace regulations that are directed toward worthy objectives but don’t work with regulations that do work, and I have given some examples. Regulations that ought to be scrapped rather than replaced will be discussed in another article.   For more information on mortgages or to shop for a mortgage in an unbiased environment, visit my website The Mortgage Professor",Denmark,has,titles
"Snapchat, despite its popularity with young people, is lagging behind rivals when it comes to suicide prevention tools. Facebook on Tuesday debuted expanded self-harm reporting tools on every version of its service. Anyone who sees a post that signals a friend may be having trouble can now go through a series of steps to report that content as ""suicidal."" The social network will suggest you reach out to the person. And the individual who posted that content will then receive resources from the Facebook team to help them get help. Twitter has similar features. Facebook's move is laudable, given its status as the single largest social network in the world. But recent reports indicate that Facebook has ceded some ground to Snapchat, where users apparently share more ""personal"" stories. But those personal stories come with no clear self-harm reporting tools. If you were to come across an alarming ""Snap"" on that platform, your means of recourse would be pretty limited. The Snapchat app only gives you the options to ""remove friend"" or ""block"" a user outright -- and it's not particularly easy to find these commands in the first place. A representative for the service confirmed to The Huffington Post that there's nothing ""specific"" allowing you to report self-harm. Snapchat does have an online form through which you can ""report a safety or abuse issue."" It's not exactly a breeze: You have to select the type of problem you're reporting, input your email address, username, age, username of the person you want to report, that person's age, the specific type of content you're reporting (""Snap,"" ""Snap Story,"" ""Snapcode Selfie"" and ""Story Explorer"" are your options), when the content was sent and any other relevant information. It also has a dedicated ""Safety Center"" with helpful resources. Given the social network's appeal to young people, there's an argument to be made for a more immediate reporting tool. So why hasn't Snapchat created better reporting tools? One argument: As opposed to Facebook or Twitter, where you're probably connected to hundreds of people you don't often speak to, Snapchat is more intimate -- you use it with your friends, and if you see something that concerns you, you likely know how to reach out to that person directly. Its users only interact with the people they want to interact with, in other words, which has no doubt contributed to the service's meteoric rise. Put another way, you wouldn't expect the telephone company to take responsibility if you had a disturbing phone call with someone. Besides, Snapchat says it doesn't even save ""Snap"" data, and a major appeal of the platform is that its messages disappear after a short amount of time.  Don't forget that Snapchat has a somewhat more ""permanent"" element called ""Stories,"" though. Here, users can post photo or video messages that last for an entire day. Many people use the feature as a sort of public diary, and the stories are viewable by any of a user's friends, if not everyone who follows that user.  And that's where you might see something from an individual you don't know but still think is worth reporting -- a bit of content that wasn't meant for you necessarily that's nonetheless worrisome. Snapchat could learn a thing or two from Facebook's updated self-harm features, especially since the app has played a role in young suicides before. While Facebook originally rolled out tools to help American users in February 2015, Tuesday's update brings those features to the entire world and presents clearer options to users. Originally, someone who posted content that was reported by a friend would see a screen inviting them to ""Talk to someone"" or ""Get tips and support."" Now, they can ""talk with a friend"" (emphasis ours), ""contact a helpline"" or tap through for tips and support. Those options will take over a user's screen when they next use Facebook, a representative told HuffPost. ""Given that Facebook is the place you’re connected to friends and family, it seemed like a natural fit,"" Dr. Jennifer Guadagno, head of Facebook's suicide prevention team, told The New York Times.  If you — or someone you know — need help, please call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. If you are outside of the U.S., please visit the International Association for Suicide Prevention for a database of international resources.",Guadagno,told,Times
"Education Week published an abridged version of this piece as a letter to the editor on 7/18/2017. This is a response to an Education Week commentary by Chester E. Finn, Jr. published on 6/19/2017.  In June, Chester E. Finn, Jr. wrote a scathing piece comparing the work of social-emotional learning (SEL) to the self-esteem movement promoted in California in the 1980s. Using the subtitle of “faux psychology,” he tried to dismiss SEL altogether. The polemic nature of his piece is probably best dealt with by ignoring it. The author seems like Sleeping Beauty waking up after 30 years, looking around, and not realizing how much the world has changed. But given a bit of time, Sleeping Beauty may be able to adjust to the new world, and the best path forward is to engage in dialogue rather than an argument. Given the history of education fads, the author is certainly right to look critically at the way SEL is sweeping the field. But let’s begin with why this might be. For decades, education’s big issue was not self-esteem; it was that education theory and practice were robbed of the perspective that the learner is primarily a human being, that the student is a whole child. The field disregarded that children make meaning both with critical cognitive focus and with emotions and passion. Thanks to a decade or so of the No Child Left Behind Act, the idea of the holistic learner was pushed out and educators were forced to focus almost entirely on students’ testable cognitive skills. Those years did, in fact, focus us on rigorous academic outcomes comparing the U.S. with international education systems. Still, while it put needed pressure on the entire education system, let’s not forget that the billions of dollars invested in the high stakes testing approach yielded limited positive results. Ultimately, No Child Left Behind was a social experiment far greater than any self-esteem education, and the results were disappointing and in some ways even harmful. Now, in an effort to mend the system, educators are trying to build up a broader version of the learner. If we understand that reality, we can work out solutions instead of tearing down the efforts to usher in a new way of engaged, personalized, and emotionally meaningful learning. We should truly view this era of experimentation and the acknowledgement of the whole child as a welcome development. Having established this issue, let’s address the specific points the author makes. First, Mr. Finn contends that SEL skills and character are not identical; on that, he is correct. Character brings in a strong moral dimension, something SEL does not typically include or want to include. However, this does not make dimensions of social-emotional development less powerful than those of character. While there is a place for character in education, the downside is that it often verges on indoctrination rather than student exploration and choice in moral development. On the other hand, SEL quite consciously stays out of the moral business by focusing on necessary competencies, such as those associated with 21st-century learning, college, and employment skills. Still, some SEL frameworks and competency lists include a few skills that have elements or morality, such as empathy, perseverance, and self-management. Thus, a productive conversation is needed rather than an a priori decision that character education is good and SEL education is not. Second, it is true that the evidence base for SEL itself is not extremely strong, however it is incorrect to say that it doesn’t exist – and it’s a growing field! Additionally, while the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) has done great work in the field, the paradigm shift we are witnessing today is far more than CASEL-related. A significant and exciting piece of this is that a number of research and practice paradigms are coming together to develop a robust field. SEL is a culmination of much research and testing ranging from neuroscience and trauma research, to in-depth studies on adversity and resiliency, all the way to the classification of 21st-century skills. Together, these well-researched fields represent a strong foundation for SEL. For this reason, I call it social-emotional development; it involves not only school-based learning, but also well-being and growth. Understanding it’s groundwork, it is hard to imagine that SED will be a momentary fad. Taken together, the support for SEL becomes much stronger than the author leads us to believe, and perhaps Sleeping Beauty will wake up to an enormously productive world that is reshaping education. Mr. Finn, we would welcome you to join this new world.",that,becomes,education
"A power outage hit about 90,000 people on Friday morning in San Francisco, closing shops and snarling traffic in the city’s technology and finance center as a large swath of the financial district lost electricity. Paul Doherty, spokesman for utility PG&E Corp, said there had been an incident at a San Francisco substation and a series of outages began affecting the city shortly after 9 a.m. (Noon ET). The utility said in a Twitter message later that it expected the outage to be fixed for most customers at 1 p.m. (4 p.m. ET). The power cut did not affect San Francisco International Airport, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said through a spokesperson that the agency had not received any reports indicating that the outage was related to any security or terrorism incident. The spokesperson requested anonymity, citing department policy. Office workers spilled onto city streets in the heart of the business district, milling about as traffic snarled, since stoplights were not working. Trains streamed through the Montgomery Street station as the outage prevented them from stopping, Bay Area Rapid Transit said, while shopkeepers in the financial district sat in darkened stores, bereft of customers. At Saint Francis Memorial Hospital in the Nob Hill neighborhood, all non-essential appointments and procedures had been canceled, spokeswoman Blair Holloway said. King Lip, chief investment officer at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco, said his offices had been hit. “It’s pretty big, seems like half the city has no power. It’s a big deal. All our systems went down. We were in the middle of a trade, luckily we have cloud-based software so all the trades are saved and we’re going to have our people in Texas or New York execute it,” he said. The outage affected central and northern parts of the city, according to the city’s Department of Emergency Management. At the salad bar chain MIXT downtown, cashiers took credit card payments using old-fashioned paper imprints, as customers lined up to eat in the dim natural light. “Old school,” commented patron Ben Fackler. “I haven’t seen that in forever.” (Writing by Peter Henderson and Sharon Bernstein; Additional reporting by Rodrigo Campos in New York, Sharon Bernstein in Sacramento, Calif., and Tom James in Seattle; Editing by Andrew Hay, Lisa Shumaker and Frances Kerry)",he,said,it
"Asian Americans face discrimination in the highly selective college admissions process. Sure, highly selective colleges will deny that they stereotype Asian American applicants to these applicants’ obvious detriment. But their denials run counter to the tenets of social psychology. We were all once hunter-gatherers. We all had to make rapid decisions to avoid predators, to forage for food — for the purpose of survival. Making rapid decisions about people is wired into our brains. When admissions officers have only a few minutes to review a file, they need to make rapid-fire assessments and every admissions officer, much like every human, suffers from bias blindspot — the notion that it’s much easier to see the bias in others than it is to see it in oneself. To deny stereotyping, including Asian-American students applying for admission to highly selective colleges, is to deny being human. But I’m not telling you something you don’t already know. Maybe you’ve even seen the data, data that demonstrates in unequivocal terms that Asian-American applicants have tougher odds in highly selective college admissions than do their non-Asian American peers. I’m not going to make the case for the extent of this discrimination because plenty of folks, plenty of organizations already are doing so. But I am going to address the strategy by which these folks, these organizations, are seemingly going about trying to end this discrimination. Because it’s the wrong strategy. Asian-American organizations filing suit against various highly selective American universities is all the rage these days. Among these cases, an Asian-American student, Hubert Zhao, filed suit against Columbia University and Cornell University, universities he believes unfairly rejected him. But his argument that he was one of only two students from his high school class of 700 students to qualify as a National Merit Semifinalist coupled with his argument about his extracurricular credentials underscores only that the group filing this case doesn’t understand the holistic admissions process. Being one of only two National Merit Semifinalists means only that the high school Hubert attends isn’t particularly competitive. And a student’s PSAT score isn’t exactly a major factor in highly selective college admissions. Extracurricular credentials? He served as president of his school’s science and debate teams. He volunteered at a hospital. He went to the world championships in robotics. To beat the system, you’ve got to understand the system. Hubert Zhao is the wrong plaintiff. He presents to us as a well-rounded applicant, precisely the type of applicant highly-selective colleges aren’t seeking. Another student who volunteers at hospitals? ZZZzzz. They want singularly talented students, students who excel in one particular area that can benefit the university offering them admission. Hubert Zhao, as his profile has been presented to us, appears to have no hook. And worse, he’s the son of the president of the organization filing the complaint, the Asian American Coalition for Education. Indeed the AACE even alleges he didn’t get in because of his father’s position — as retribution. It begs the question: Was Hubert Zhao truly the best plaintiff for this case? It appears doubtful. When litigators Ted Olsen and David Boies filed suit to make marriage equality the law of the land, you can bet they chose happy, law-abiding LGBT citizens as their plaintiffs. You can bet they ran background checks. You can bet they selected their plaintiffs wisely. The same cannot be said for the Asian American Coalition for Education. But worse than choosing the wrong plaintiff, these groups hoping to end the discrimination Asian American applicants face in highly selective college admissions are choosing the wrong way of seeking change. You see, change is a protagonist in our nation’s story ever since we ragtag colonialists chose to rebel against the King of England. And just like in colonial times and as we are reminded throughout the arc of our history, change starts with the populace. Selma. Seneca Falls. Stonewall. These were the respective birthplaces of the civil rights, women’s rights, and gay rights movements in America. These movements began with the populace. Not in the courtroom. These movements achieved landmark successes in the courtroom that will echo through the ages. But they weren’t born there. The groups and individuals filing complaints against various highly selective universities alleging discrimination against Asian American applicants believe that the system is unfair. And I don’t disagree with them. But they’d be wise to study our American history if they really do wish to fix the system. I’ll be rooting for them.",who,student,hospitals
"I have never been a huge fan of PISA data, the goulash of test results released internationally by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that’s responsible for a thousand chicken littling articles about how we’re getting smoked by the students of Estonia.  But in April this story dropped. Folks  had begun a mild-tomedium freakout because the East Asian PISA math  superpowers (South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, etc), the people  whose program everyone else was trying to imitate, had seen their  scores start to drop.   But now Andreas Schleicher, the official in charge of Pisa, has said  that this fall may not be due to a drop in the performance of these  Asian powerhouses. He said he was looking into whether the decline could  be explained by the fact that Pisa used computers for the main tests  for the first time in 2015.  In other words, data that is clearly presented as “comparable” in the study may not be comparable at all.  Which means the whole longitudinal game of charting PISA scores over  time could be ruined, all those nifty charts now meaningless.
  
 There's another implication here as well. The Testocrats have been  quietly assuming that taking a Big Standardized Test on a computer is  exactly like taking it on paper. But what if that's not true? What if  taking a math test involves not only math skills, but test-taking  skills. And what if computer test-taking skills are not the same set of  skills as pencil-and-paper test-taking skills?  What if the Big Standardized Tests aren't really measuring what they  purport to measure at all, and the whole test-centered education model  is built on a sham?

"An extremely rare species of frog has been classified into a genus previously known only through fossils, scientists declared this week.   In 1996, the Hula painted frog became the first amphibian officially considered extinct by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Originally discovered in the Hula Valley in 1943, the last confirmed sighting had been in 1955, more than 40 years before scientists finally decided to label the species as extinct. In 2011, a park ranger named Yoram Malka spotted one of the frogs in the Hula Valley Nature Reserve.  Since then, scientists have discovered up to 14 of the frogs, National Geographic reports. The IUCN has already redefined the frog from being “extinct” to “critically endangered” in 2012, but one detail of its classification remains outdated: The Hula painted frog is no longer considered to be a part of the Discoglossus genus.     Sarig Gafny, a scientist at the Ruppin Academic Center in Michmoret, Israel, conducted a study on the rediscovered species, published this week in Nature Communications journal. In addition to the exciting re-emergence of the frogs, new information came to light in Gafny’s study: The frog is not a member of the Discoglossus genus as previously thought, but instead is the last survivor of Latonia, an extinct amphibian genus previously known only through fossils.  ""Imagine that somewhere in north east Asia someone discovered a local species of elephants that was not known to science, and then, two years later, they present strong evidence that this elephant species is actually a mammoth,"" Professor Gafny explained to the Huffington Post in an email. ""I assume that finding a live mammoth would have been a striking piece of news."" Rebecca Biton, a paleontologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and co-author of the study, explained that the researchers decided to reclassify the frog after analyzing DNA and ancient frog bones. ""The Hula painted frog is not what we thought it was,"" Biton told LiveScience. According to Tablet Magazine, the Hula painted frog is indigenous to a location rich with history. Known as Merom in the Hebrew Bible, the location where Joshua supposedly defeated the Canaanites, the Hula Lake and surrounding marshlands were drained in the 1950s due to malarial concerns. Parts of the valley were flooded again and restored to become the Hula Valley Nature Reserve in the 1990s. ""Scientists tend to err on the side of caution before declaring something extinct, so we were pretty sure this frog was gone,"" said Robin Moore, the creative director of Amphibian Survival Alliance. ""[The re-discovery of the Hula Painted Frog is] a real testament to the resilience of nature.”",discovery,is,nature
"The first thought I had when news broke about the alleged store thefts in China by UCLA freshman basketball player LiAngelo Ball and two teammates was not about him or them, but me. Apart from the alleged thefts happening in a foreign country and the space of decades in time, it was almost a carbon copy of the situation I faced as a star football player at a Los Angeles high school. I and a couple of other football buddies were charged with theft from a local department store. We were paraded out of the store in handcuffs by four LAPD officers. At the local station, we were grilled by detectives on the alleged theft. I was given a stern warning that I would be prosecuted if I didn’t confess. I did. I was released later that evening. However, that did not end the ordeal. When I was being taken from the store in cuffs, one of the parents of one of my football teammates spotted me. She stared in disbelief as I was being led away. The next day, this was the buzz on the campus, I was called into the coach’s office. I was grilled again by the coach and the vice principal on my actions and the detention. I was threatened with suspension from the team and from class for several days. It did not go any further than the threat and a warning. There was a reason ― I was a star lineman, and was one of the leaders in number of tackles. I was just too valuable to cut loose even for one game. This less-than-a-hand slap punishment was done almost with a wink and a nod. This little drama with crime, the police, school officials and the coaches reinforced an attitude that was already deeply ingrained in me and the other start performers on the team. We were special. We could pretty much do what we wanted without fear of punishment as long as we were a valued sports commodity. I rarely carried a book, let alone cracked it. I knew that all I had to do was go through the motions in the classroom, and I would be assured of passing. This heavy sense of entitlement and a virtual free pass to do whatever I pleased without any real fear of repercussion or punishment was like living in fairy tale land. This total dimmed my sense of responsibility, respect for rules and the law, and ethical behavior. The athletic pedestal, I, and the others, were on didn’t dim. It obliterated our moral compass. The entitlement syndrome that I, and other top athletes, had was almost unshakeable and in far too many other cases took a huge tool on the lives of several other top athletes at the school. They also were pampered, coddled, and sheltered so long that once there playing days were over they nose-dived into a downward spiral of drugs, alcohol, domestic abuse, job loss and repeated run ins with the law. It was no surprise then that Trump would intervene on behalf of the three UCLA players to secure their release. it was no surprise that Chinese authorities quickly agreed to their release. It will be no surprise if the three receive a hand slap punishment for their alleged crimes. Ball is a touted athlete. His father, through his outrageous self-promotion and commercialism of his sons, has virtually insured that NCAA and UCLA officials will tread very carefully on what kind of discipline they mete out to the players. The NCAA, for its part, has been all over the map in how it punishes schools for violations of its athlete discipline rules and guidelines. It pretty much leaves the discipline game to the schools. That almost always means that player punishment for infractions is dumped back into the laps of coaches. These are the same coaches who know their big salaries, coaching tenure and future coaching prospects depend on one thing and one thing only ― how many “Ws” is on their resume. University presidents and top officials also know the importance of the bushels of dollars and prestige that a successful, well-oiled football or basketball program can bring to their institution. And don’t think the top players don’t know that there wouldn’t be much of an athletic program at a major university without their star power on the field or the court. There is already a hint of a less than aggressive takedown of Ball and the other players. Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott issued the obligatory statement of regret over the action of the players, and then shut down any query about what could happen with the limp retort that, “We will continue to closely monitor the situation.” The UCLA coaches, athletic director and chancellor were even more close mouthed. The bigger question for me is did the athletes get it? That entitlement from athletic stardom and grooming has a deep pitfall. One that I fell into but fortunately climbed out of. We’ll see with them. Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst. His latest book is, The impeachment of President Trump? (Amazon Kindle) will be released in August. He is a weekly co-host of the Al Sharpton Show on Radio One. He is the host of the weekly Hutchinson Report on KPFK 90.7 FM Los Angeles and the Pacifica Network.",I,was,game
"Earlier this week, I posted a story about ICS, the private Swiss school where my son with special needs, is now enrolled. The response to this post has been tremendous. But I haven’t shared an important part of our story— the unique woman who made our move to Zurich and my son’s entrance to ICS possible. I haven’t written about Sylvia Leck. *** Last year, I shot a tiny prayer across the sea, from Connecticut to Zürich, Switzerland. I hoped it might land in the heart of a person (a figment of my imagination perhaps?) with knowledge of special needs children, teaching experience, an open mind, and immense compassion. It seemed crazy. My prayer was really an email, aimed toward anybody who could help my son get back to school. I was told by multiple sources that there was only one person in the entire country of Switzerland who could help my child. Her name was Sylvia Leck and she ran an organization called Foundations for Learning.  I wrote: Dear Sylvia, We are considering a move from Connecticut to Zurich because of my husband’s job and also because we’ve had great difficulty finding appropriate education for our oldest son Thomas.  I wrote… He is gifted, hyperactive, impulsive, very kind, and athletic.  I didn’t sugarcoat anything. I wrote about his difficulties with social skills, the impossibility of finding a school for him in the U.S., and his resulting severe depression.  As I completed one more inquiry, I felt kind of depressed myself. I thought of all the people and institutions so far unable to help us. I wondered what Sylvia or anyone in Zürich had to gain by responding. I’d written a query on a couple of Swiss expat sites asking for recommendations for my child. “Don’t move here,” one person had responded. “They don’t help kids like that in Switzerland,” another said. But I sent the email to Sylvia anyway, launched from a U.S. educational landscape that had demonstrated that it did not want to work with this type of child. Ever. That’s why I call the email a prayer. In order to send it, I had to believe something could change. Sylvia responded the same day.  From first contact, thousands of miles away, a woman originally from the UK, living in Switzerland, seemed to understand my son and me. Her sing-song British voice welcomed me like Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle. It was friendly and accepting, and felt beyond foreign. She setup a phone consultation, and within days I was chatting on the phone with her as I walked down a long Connecticut Road, terrified we’d be disconnected.  “Sounds like a hard situation,” I remember her saying after listening. Though her tone was serious, it was also reassuring. She asked questions and listened more.  I waited for her to tell me to stay in Connecticut. I expected the flat road that we were on to continue forever. “It sounds like he needs to be back in school,” she said, “As soon as possible…I’ll see what I can do… “ Later she said, “We’ll figure out a way to make this work, Amy.” And that’s what Sylvia did. I’m telling you, the woman has arms. Her arms extended across the Atlantic, making me feel that she would not let us drown, that we could do this, together. She demonstrated respect (and still does today) for my husband and my opinions, my ideas, my knowledge about my child. It was Sylvia who gave me the confidence that we could pickup our bags and move. It was Sylvia who studied the background of my child. It was Sylvia who arranged for us to visit her team of professionals, to visit ICS, to connect with parents, teachers and even another student online weeks before our move. It was Sylvia who waited for me to meet her, a few days before Christmas when family arrived in Zurich, and the rest of Switzerland was already on vacation. Sylvia was quite sick with a virus, but still hard at work, and she asked genuinely “How are you doing?” I could tell she truly wanted to know. Later I learned that as a special education teacher, Sylvia had dreamt of starting a place like Foundations for Learning for many years before the doors actually opened. In Switzerland, this feat was incredibly unusual. I learned that she did not actually need our business, rather the entire country of Switzerland needs the services she now offers through her staff at Foundations For Learning. There are so many schools, so many kids who need people like Sylvia—people who want to help kids who aren’t so simple to teach. People who want to work with public and private schools, to listen to parents, to do what’s best for a child with special needs. People who want to make inclusion healthy, safe and possible. “She has a heart of gold,” one parent said. “There’s no one like Sylvia,” another said. But I am hopeful. I’m hopeful that more people will not only call on Foundations for Learning to support their children, but I’m hopeful that more teachers, more administrators, more schools will learn from people like Sylvia.

"Iowa lawmakers approved a “fetal heartbeat” abortion ban on Wednesday, pushing the state one step closer to having the most restrictive stance on abortion in the country. The bill requires women seeking abortions to submit to an ultrasound to screen for a fetal heartbeat. A fetal heartbeat can typically be detected around six weeks, often before a woman realizes she is pregnant.  If a heartbeat is detected, this bill would ban Iowa’s health care providers from performing an abortion.  The bill was approved by Iowa’s Senate on a 29-17 vote and now heads to the desk of Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds. The governor hasn’t indicated publicly whether she will sign the bill, but she is generally an opponent of abortion rights.  “I’m pro-life. I’m proud to be pro-life. I’ve made that very clear,” Reynolds said Wednesday, according to The Associated Press.  Activists on both sides of the abortion rights debate say they expect the bill to be challenged in court. In fact, some anti-abortion activists are hoping the case will make its way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, where President Donald Trump’s appointee, Justice Neil Gorsuch, has effectively created a conservative majority. Abortion opponents hope they now have a shot at challenging Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that acknowledged women’s constitutional right to an abortion.  “We created an opportunity to take a run at Roe v. Wade ― 100 percent,” Republican state Sen.r Rick Bertrand of Sioux City told Reuters.  Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood, called the bill an “extreme and draconian policy that takes aim at a woman’s right to control her own body, life, and future.” “This bill is one more example of state politicians, emboldened by the Trump-Pence administration, carrying out policy after policy that strip away people’s freedoms and access to care,” Laguens said in a statement. “The right to control your body includes the right to access safe, legal abortion. Your body is your own, if it is not, we cannot be truly free or equal.” The bill provides exceptions when the woman’s life is in danger. It also allows exceptions in cases of rape or incest ― but only if the woman reports the incident to police or a physician within 45 days for a rape case or 140 days for incest.  Iowa state Rep. Mary Wolfe (D-Clinton) pointed out that child victims of rape are often too scared or don’t know they’re pregnant until they start to show. Making it mandatory for them to report a rape within 45 days, or 6½ weeks, would mean forcing these vulnerable girls to have children. Rep. Lungren says the point of the hard 45 day abortion ban for rape victims is to encourage rape victims to report their rapes in a timely manner. So if it takes that terrified 12 year old rape victim 46 days to report ... too bad for her - she’s having her rapist’s baby. Ugh. https://t.co/sB6z0yBhTd Wolfe called the measure a “blatantly unconstitutional bill that tramples on the liberty of Iowa women.” A Pew Research Center survey from 2014 found that a slim majority of Iowans (52 percent) believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Forty-six percent said that the procedure should illegal in all or most cases.  Iowa isn’t the only state seeking to curtail abortion rights. Laws that restrict abortion procedures after 15 weeks in Mississippi and 11 weeks in Kentucky are currently being challenged in those states.  Fetal heartbeat bills were approved in North Dakota and Arkansas in 2013 but were struck down by a federal appeals court. The U.S. Supreme Court at the time declined to review those cases. ",Iowa,is,rights
"If I had to choose the one featured performer in a play or musical, on or off-Broadway, who I thought was giving the best performance this season, it would be Ruthie Ann Miles in Lincoln Center Theater's revival of The King and I. I'm sure, based on our interview, if I were on the phone with her, telling her I was starting the post this way, she would say: ""Thank you, that's so nice, I appreciate it, but you really don't have to say that. It's too much."" But it's true so I'm going to say it.

I've seen many The King and I productions throughout the years, but I've never seen a Lady Thiang quite like Miles's Lady Thiang. She has a real strength about her, but also a real sensitivity and warmth. She clearly loves her King. She is not someone who is just there, she realizes everything going on around her. Her ""Something Wonderful"" is amazing vocally--I'm sure those who saw her in Here Lies Love are not surprised by that--but what I think is so brilliant about her performance is her ability to pay attention to her surroundings. We've all been there in the theater for this: a supporting character is onstage, but not the focus of the attention, and that actor is obviously in his/her own world. You can tell when you look at the performer, that person assumes you are not looking at her/him, and that person is just waiting for a cue, not focusing on the character. Miles is present in every moment. Her Lady Thiang quietly watches everything that goes on around her. If you sit close enough, you'll see her eyes widen and constrict during certain relevant parts. And I'm not talking about at the first performance or at the second performance, I'm talking about last week, when she was likely already a little fatigued thanks to the award show season. She is still watching the other performers, in character. Her moments of talking and singing are great, but the story for her character is also told in her moments of silence. Because of the intelligence of the performance throughout, Lady Thiang is more empathetic than in other productions I have seen. People leave the theater talking about her, in addition to Kelli O'Hara of course. They leave the theater talking about a character that often is a bland afterthought in mountings of The King and I. Yes, she has one amazing song (and leads another quirky one), but you usually don't think of her beyond that. People who see this King and I will think about Lady Thiang. They will think about what she knows, what she feels, what is motivating her. That is the genius of Ruthie Ann Miles's performance.   I was so happy when she received her Tony nomination and when she won the Outer Critics Circle Award. I realize she's not the favorite for the big award, but, while all the nominees in that category are giving notable performances, she's my choice. So I asked her to take time out of her busy schedule -- in addition to being a Tony nominee, with all the activities that entails, she is the mother of an almost two-and-a-half year old daughter who she says is giving her and her husband ""a run for [their] money"" -- to speak with me about her Tony Awards experience thus far. How did you find out you were nominated? My agent called me right away. I had pretty bad insomnia the night before. Maybe because I knew the nominations were the next day. Maybe. I  try not to pay attention to those things. My daughter was sick the night before. She woke up in the middle of the night. And I'm one of those people who has trouble falling back asleep. She woke up 6am, she usually sleeps until 8am. She finally went back to sleep at 7am. I fell back asleep as well, and then my agent [Dustin Flores from THE MINE talent agency] called me. He said: ""Ruthie? How are you doing? What are you doing?"" I said: ""I just woke up. What is wrong?"" Then my phone starting buzzing and ringing. I thought something horrible had happened, like 9/11. He said nothing was wrong, I had just been nominated for a Tony.  As he's telling me I got nominated for a Tony, I hear Abigail say from the next room: ""Mommy, wake up now. I poo-pooed."" So almost immediately it's back to normal life. My daughter is saying she needs my attention more than the phone call. I hung up and took care of business.

Who was the first person you wanted to call and tell?

I have a few girlfriends that are just the dearest to me. I Facetimed with one, and then while I was doing that, one had texted and the other left a voicemail. They know me so, so well. They didn't say ""congratulations."" They said things like: ""Breath. Calm down. If you need me, I'm here for you."" They know me so very well.  They were just reminding me that everything comes and goes. It's going to be crazy now. They said: ""Don't go on Facebook."" I still haven't really. When I go on, I skip over certain days. It's just so overwhelming. So many people have been so kind. People I haven't spoken to in decades remembering a performance I did or a song I sang in PE to motivate us. It's been so nice, but I need to read those slowly in private. Where was your husband? He had already left for work. He left me a voicemail. He's a civilian. The message said: ""I read about your nomination. This is a big deal, right? I love you."" It was three sentences. It put the biggest smile on my face. If I start to buy into the hype, it's going to be too much. My mother came in, and she treated it like just another thing. She congratulated me, but she treated it like a good review. She was happy for me like after a good review. This is your Broadway debut and therefore you're a naturally a first-time nominee. There is a ton of stuff that goes along with being nominated; I think people don't often realize. Were you expecting the amount of activities involved in a nomination?
 No. In the biggest loudest, longest way I could ever say it: NO! I had no clue. We're also going to be performing. So we've had multiple rehearsals for a scene we do every night. Last Thursday, 30 to 40 people from the Tony Awards crew, video staff and their assistants came to see the performance. We are going to have 30 minutes after the show to get out of hair and makeup and get to the Tonys in buses. I have never been before. I have been watching it for years. I've never been. It was a dream of mine to attend the ceremony once. Just to attend. But I never dreamed it would be like this. It's amazing to know now what it takes to put on something so huge. Millions of people watch it -- of course it takes this much, I just didn't realize. They do a scratch tape, so they were taping us. We have to be there at 9am for rehearsal on the day of the show.  I had no clue. It's so seemless when you watch it on television. I maybe pictured one camera director and four cameras. So I pictured someone saying: ""Camera A, Camera D, Camera A, Camera C."" That is what I thought. It's not that. It is a massive team of people who are never going to get applause. It's huge.

And there are so many events before... I think a smarter me would have asked how many events I'd be going to and do a tally of how many dresses I was going to need and then ask someone to dress me. I've worn everything I have, things I wore for Here Lies Love events, things I wore before that. It's been wonderful, I'm not complaining. I had no clue how many people would want to celebrate with me. I won the Lucille Lortel Award and the Theatre World Award for Here Lies Love. The Lortels do only off-Broadway, but the Theatre World Awards do both on Broadway and off-Broadway and they noticed me, and Conrad [Ricamora], who was also in the show. I remember it so well. Tom Hanks was there. Me and Tom Hanks. This year, they both asked me to present. I was very, very, very honored. Those had such an impact on me. It's been many events, but it's been wonderful. I would go to them all -- if so many of them didn't conflict.
 What are you doing for your dress? Ms. [Anna] Wintour is nicely handling all of that; I'm consulting with one of her stylists. Wow. When did you find out? A couple of weekends ago. Last week one of the stylists came to theater to talk to me about what I like, what colors. I said: ""I tell stories for a living, you are a professional. I will do whatever you want me to do.""

When do you find out what you're going to wear?

I'm going next week to try on some things.

And it's perfect because you are out of your own dresses. Yes. It's a lot less stress not having any say! It is wonderful.   I am assuming your husband is going to be your date to the ceremony? Yes, and my agent is going to be sitting with me, which is great. I've been with my agency for many years -- he means a lot to me. So I was really honored that he is spending the high ticket price to be by my side. It's really a very high ticket price.   Other than in your category -- who are you rooting for most?

 I cannot imagine Kelli not winning. I watch her every night and I learn something about Ruthie and Lady Thiang. I learn so much from her every night. Lady Thiang doesn't talk that much, but sometimes I wonder: ""Lady Thiang, why do you talk so much? You should just want Kelli playing Anna."" Her performance is subtle and powerful at the same time. It's not a flashy performance, it's very subtle. But if you watch her, she will change your life. Anna Leonowens went in there to teach these children to give them a better future, Kelli is a teacher, watching Kelli makes me better. I can't entertain the idea that she won't win. All photos are from The King and I and by Paul Kolnik. In addition to Ruthie Ann Miles, the bottom photo features Ashley Park, who plays Tuptim in the revival.",I,seen,Thiang
" This is Part One of a three-part series about Mitigating the College Mental Health Crisis.  Every generation has its' own martyrdom anthems.  Boomers (born 1945-1960): I had to walk ten miles in the snow to get to school. 
Generation X (born 1961-1980): I had to wait at the bus stop in the cold.
Millennials (born 1981-1995): I didn't always get a turn in the heated front seat on the way to school.
Gen 2020 (born after 1995): They keep calling me special snowflake. As a first generation college student turned college professor, daughter, and mother of a college junior and a high school junior, both sides of the debate on who had it the ""worst"" are very familiar to me.  Boomers: I never dreamt of going to college. It just wasn't an option. I went straight to work. 
Generation X: I didn't have that many choices for college. I had to work my way through. 
Millennials: I applied to 12 schools, took my SAT's five times. And those essays...  
Gen 2020: I had homework in Kindergarten; my life mapped out by 8. Even with a perfect 4.0, test scores, and having founded a non-profit when I was 12, I won't get in anywhere, and if I do, it will cost me more than a Range Rover. I've been in higher education for almost eight years, and in the mental health field for twenty-two. I arrived to University life because of my grave concerns about the escalating mental health crisis in education. Between admissions pressures, costs, and perils of actually finding a job after all that's invested, anxieties are widespread, to say the least.  A recent survey by STAT reveals that colleges are scrambling to keep up with the demands for mental health services, with average wait times of two weeks. The cry for adequate services is receiving national attention. In the wake of seven student deaths at Columbia, a petition urging leaders there, and at top-tier institutions including Yale, MIT, and Harvard to allocate more resources is circulating. As with any crisis, there are lots of theories about who's to blame. Fingers are pointed at parents, students, and administrators. Rarely do we take a look through a generational lens to understand what we've gotten wrong in the past, ways we're off mark now, and where we can go from here.  Boomers: Therapy? That's for crazy people.
Generation X: I saw my first therapist when I was an adult.
Millennials: Embarrassed about therapy? No. My friends are all in therapy too.  
Gen 2020: I have a whole team of coaches and therapists. Too many myths about what's really happening on and off campuses distract us from having conversations that can help students cultivate the agility and resilience they need in and outside the classroom.   Myth # 1: Students of today are all bubble-wrapped. They're coddled special snowflakes; that's why they need their safe spaces and therapists. While the bubble wrap theories attacking Millennials have become popular sport, with people suggesting the generation is not only lactose intolerant, but life intolerant, there's much more to the story. Here's how to dig deeper:

1. Check their ID's. Remember that students aren't just 18-22. Among the college students of today reporting high stress are ""non-traditional"" students. They've become the new ""traditional"" student--those who are adult working professionals, veterans, and parents returning to the classroom as undergraduate and graduate students. The Anxiety and Depression Society of America cites that 65% of adult working students experience significant anxiety, as they work to juggle the demands of career, family, and academics.  2. Be like Bill Nye. Know your science. Advances in science and medicine have overturned Freud and his couch, helping us move from a deficit, blaming approach to recognizing that mental health disruptions are functions of our physiology. We now have a dearth of brain science that helps us understand how chemistry affects mood and cognition. Depression can be just as debilitating and life threating as other medical conditions like cancer, but have historically been chalked up as signs of weakness, moral failings, and now, allegedly, too much bubble wrap. We can barely keep up with the constant breakthroughs in science, but if we overlook the functions of the frontal lobe, dopamine, endorphins and serotonin, among others, we won't be able to have honest and accurate conversation about mental health. 3. Do the math. Mental illness isn't simply a result of thin skin, but a complex interplay of what's known as biopsychosocial factors: biological, psychological and social. The socio-political climate, lack of sleep, time pressure, academic rigor, financial worries, technostress, and eroding social support adds up, with disastrous cumulative effects. Over the last few decades, we've gone from having 2.94 close confidants to 2.08, but college students most commonly report having 0. This is a formula that equals disaster. Social isolation amplifies biological dispositions to anxiety and depression. Unfortunately, access to timely help is proving to be a defining challenge of the college mental health crisis. Stayed tune for Part Two of this series, focusing on the number one barrier to getting help: stigma.  Dr. Kristen Lee, known as ""Dr. Kris"", is an award-winning behavioral science professor, clinician and author from Boston, Massachusetts. Dr. Kris is a licensed independent clinical social worker known for her advocacy in promoting increased mental health integration in social policies and institutions to facilitate access and improved health outcomes in the U.S. and across the globe. She regularly works with students and faculty and consults with universities and colleges to mitigate the college mental health crisis.

"Last week, Governor Jerry Brown signed into law Assembly Bill 189 , a measure empowering the California Arts Council to designate areas as Cultural Districts in a competitive application process.  Craig Watson, Director of the California Arts Council said, ""The signing of AB 189, is great news for communities of all sizes, all across our state ... (we will)  play a central role in strengthening local communities through economic growth, increased tourism, and community cohesion. The resources we expect to bring together on a statewide level will strengthen existing districts and foster the development of new cultural hubs.""  Governor Brown, Craig Watson, and of course, Assemblyman Richard Bloom (D-Santa Monica)  who introduced AB 189, all undoubtedly see the connections between the arts and creativity and, in turn, between creativity and innovation and want California to continue to lead the nation in the development of theatrical films, television, cable and Internet programs, video games, high tech hardware and software goods and services which are the heart and soul of the new economy. AB 189 charges the Council to formulate a plan to foster Art Districts throughout the state, thereby enhancing creativity, and in the process, reinventing the landscape of cities throughout the state. The Council, always looking at ways to enhance creativity in the schools and almost everywhere art is displayed, has now joined the movement to change communities too. They will, according to the legislation, ""provide technical and promotional support to the districts, as well as collaborate with public agencies and private entities to maximize the benefits to the local and state economy."" To date, 15 states have taken on a formalized State role in the creation of art and cultural districts. Together, they are leading the effort to transform America for the rapidly evolving creative economy. According to the National Assembly of State Art Agencies, such ""districts are special areas designated or certified by state governments, that utilize cultural resources to encourage economic development and foster synergies between the arts and other businesses. State cultural districts have evolved into focal points that feature many types of businesses, foster a high quality of life for residents, attract tourism and engender civic pride."" Arts districts, usually found on the periphery of a city center, are intended to create a critical mass of art galleries, dance clubs, theaters, art cinemas, music venues, and public squares for performances. Often, such places also attract  cafes, restaurants and retail shops.   More and more however, cities are thinking about such districts as a way to insure the city attracts, nurtures and retains the creative workforce it needs to succeed in the new economy, an economy vitally dependent on creativity and innovation. As important as reinventing our systems of education, communities where people young and old spend more than half their day living and working, aspiring art and culture districts are essential to  establishing vibrant and productive communities. Indeed, these places are the incubators of creativity.  Art and Culture Districts, says Theresa Cameron, formerly Local Arts Agency Services Program Manager of Americans for the Arts (AFTA), ""have the potential -- with their critical mass of art galleries, cinemas, music venues, public squares for performances, restaurants, cafes and retail shops -- of attracting, and nurturing the creative workforce our cities need to succeed in the new economy."" Recently AFTA has created a website devoted to the ""who, what and why"" these districts are so important.  As the geographical landscape of a city morphs into a larger metropolitan region--partly because of population growth, mostly out of economic necessity -- what we call downtown becomes even more critical to the wealth and well-being of the people living in those communities. Few efforts to insure America's success and survival in the new economy could be more important. Arkansas, Colorado, Kentucky and Massachusetts are the most recent state agencies to establish such an initiative. Eight other states recognized such districts as tax free enterprises and have adopted similar efforts. The appointees to Art Councils, usually loyal friends of the elected Governor, don't often take on issues of local economic development. But this seems to be changing, as many appointees are visionary leaders, action oriented, and making their voices heard. States use a variety of tax incentives to encourage business development within local cultural districts. Examples of state incentives include sales, income, or property tax credits or exemptions for goods produced or sold within the district; or preservation tax credits for historic property renovations and rehabilitation. Maybe a state will offer an amusement or admission tax waiver for events within the district. All the plans vary and the funding is uniquely packaged to insure sustainability. The ""State Cultural District"" designation from the Art Council seems to be enough for cities to apply, but you have to wonder what cities could do and whether smaller cities might apply if a little financial help were forthcoming. You have to wonder too, what might be possible if more organizations, chambers of commerce, economic development agencies and high tech companies in a region joined forces to help in the reinvention effort.",that,are,arts
"The Hollywood Reporter's scathing investigation of the American Humane Association (AHA) this week supports and expands upon what PETA US has been reporting for years: AHA monitoring is woefully inadequate, and as a result, animals used in film and television are sometimes put in dangerous situations and injured or killed. Last year, PETA US presented the AHA with a list of recommendations for making film and television productions safer for animals, but the suggestions were ignored, and the situation for animals appears to be worsening.  Following PETA US' release of shocking, behind-the-scenes information about the treatment of horses on the set of Luck, whistleblowers on both TV and film sets, including animal trainers and even AHA insiders, sent in a burgeoning number of reports alleging mistreatment of animals during production. Around this time last year, PETA US received five separate reports from whistleblowers who worked on Peter Jackson's blockbuster The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey stating that dozens of animals had died or were severely injured. Horses fell to their deaths off cliffs, sheep and goats broke their legs and chickens were torn apart by dogs. All the deaths were avoidable and were reported to have occurred despite the fact that wranglers had expressed their concerns to the production team and even though this film was ""monitored"" by the AHA. It has been alleged that AHA management has looked the other way or even been complicit in arranging for the filming of sequences that were clearly potentially dangerous for animals. The AHA management has also reportedly ignored the concerns of animal trainers, who, in the past, have relied on AHA representatives to take their concerns to production teams rather than raising objections themselves. Over the years, some AHA monitors with good intentions have done their best to keep animals safe. But their complaints have routinely been ignored on set and swept cavalierly aside by their own organisation, the AHA.  The AHA currently has plans to begin charging producers for the films that it monitors, which is a conflict of interest, given that films in which animals were revealed to have been harmed have been stamped ""no animals harmed."" If this new policy goes into effect, the AHA would seem even less likely to wish to jeopardise its funding, which comes largely from the Screen Actors Guild, by protecting animals, and surely more animals will be put at risk.  While millions of dollars go into making films, animals who are used as living props and unpaid ""talent"" are often not even provided with basic care to ensure their safety. And it's not just the danger on set that's an issue. Wild animals used in entertainment are subjected to abusive training methods such as beatings, electric shocks, psychological torment and food deprivation. Many are taken away from their loving mothers when they are just babies, forced to live their entire lives in extreme confinement and punished if they ""disobey."" When they are no longer profitable to their owners or become too difficult to handle, usually at puberty, they are frequently discarded and forced to live alone in small cages at seedy roadside zoos or perform in sleazy travelling shows.  Rather than paying AHA representatives to be on set, filmmakers can easily protect animals by leaving them out of their stories or modernising their techniques and opting for computer-generated imagery, animatronics and blue-screen technology. It's high time that Hollywood left the acting to human actors and left animals out of it.",they,discarded,shows
"“It is my duty to voice the sufferings of people, the sufferings that never end and are as big as mountains.” ― Käthe Kollwitz The great German artist, printmaker and sculptor Käthe Kolwitz (1867-1945) knew profound personal suffering. After her younger son Peter died in battle in Flanders in October, 1914 she fell into a deep depression that re-shaped both her art and political views. The double sculpture that she finally completed in 1931 for the cemetery in which he son was buried, shows the artist and her husband apparently kneeling in grief. However, when asked about the theme of the sculpture Kollwitz explained that it was about much more than grief: it also represents all parents of her generation, asking forgiveness for having led their sons into war. The Grieving Parents, like so many of Kollwitz’ finest works, is grounded in empathy: the ability to understand and share the feelings of another. She recognized that she was expressing something greater than her own feelings and that her art could only function if it served an entire society. Grief and loss are universal feelings that bind us, and sharing them with others leads to consolation and social transformation. It is not surprising that in 1936 the Nazi party barred Kollwitz from displaying her work which they branded as “degenerate.” Deep feelings for the sufferings and losses of others—which lead to collective introspection—can lead to resistance against authoritarian politicians and those who advocate war and other forms of sacrifice and suffering. It is interesting to note that the idea of empathy is a late-nineteenth/early twentieth century development, that derives from the imaginative act of projecting oneself into a work of art. In her book You Must Change Your Life: The Story of Rainer Maria Rilke and Auguste Rodin, author Rachel Corbett writes: The invention of empathy corresponds to many of the climactic shifts in the art, philosophy and psychology of fin-de-siècle Europe, and it changed the way artists thought about their work and the way observers related to it for generations to come. The development of empathy as a social expectation and custom parallels the development of Expressionism: of inwardness as a gateway to emotional connection. That inwardness—so essential in the modern conception of a self-aware individual—is the hinge that connects to social awareness and the empathetic understanding of others. Empathy is, without doubt, a political force that plays a considerable role in attitudes towards social issues. In a recent article for Psychology Today—Beware America’s Shocking Loss of Empathy—attorney and social advocate David Noise argues that empathy and it’s “cousin” compassion are crucial elements in politics and policy, arguing that they “lead to an intelligent assessment of what is happening internally and around the world, a minimal level of humane values, and rational attempts to apply those values.” In the context of America’s recent Presidential election, where outrage, uncivil discourse and personal attacks demonstrated a shocking lack of empathy, it seems critical for artists to ask themselves about the role of empathy in their own work. Whether their work is political, personal or somewhere in-between, the element of empathy can allow an artist to “give voice to the sufferings of others,” as Käthe Kolwitz did so nobly in her works. Below is a selection of responses posted on my personal Facebook page after I asked the question: What is the role of empathy in your art?  Note: some responses have been edited for brevity. Steven Holmes: Making art assumes empathy. Making art is an act of sharing. It is by definition, an invitation to others to leave their isolation and meet others on the same road as you. An artist without empathy is a sociopath. Mark David Lloyd: Empathy can be painful. Much of my artwork on a conceptual level deals with suffering in one form of another, empathy is experienced in the making process of the artworks and sometimes by the viewer. When we witness suffering and distress in others, our natural tendency to empathize can bring us vicarious pain. Colin Darke: It plays the central role. I only paint or draw in hopes of having a shared experience ― my picture echoing the viewer’s feelings (past or present, happiness/sadness/wonderment) in a new and powerful way. Julia Morgan Scott: I have become somewhat suspicious of efforts to consciously insert empathy into painting. It seems IMHO to politicize something natural to the process of simply painting what one truly loves. Isaias Sandoval-Streufert: For me empathy is essential, without empathy it will be only apathy, my work is about passion, I can’t paint apathy even if I try. Karen Kaapcke: I also have the thought that it is possible that people with high levels of empathy take to the arts as vehicles for that way of being, because it is possibly not an easy way of being (I am thinking of myself when quite young, being almost unbearably disturbed by seeing certain things, or being almost unbearably moved by the beauty of something. Both are equally empathic. A life in the arts might make being that way a little more bearable). Nancy Good: Empathy is key as it speaks the language of connection, i.e. connection to the life experiences of the viewer. We are all connected in pain, joy, fear, wonder, hunger, yearning ... all we experience. Empathy in art banishes isolation and invites healing. Franck De Las Mercedes: Most of my work stems from an emotionally charged, at times dark, at times painful place. To hear others regard it as beautiful or meaningful to their lives is the biggest compliment. The gift is in sharing and understanding the feelings and experiences of another. F. Scott Hess: Empathy is the link that a painter of figures relies on to make others feel the work. It happens before conscious thought, before critical analysis kicks in. You grab your audience by their empathetic guts before they know what’s happening. Gesture, facial expression, movement, composition, and paint application all work together to achieve this end. Judith Peck: In order to create, I have to feel very deeply, without that connection I believe my work would be a hollow shell. Steph Rocknak: From an article I wrote a few years ago: “Psychology, which in many respects grew out of Hume’s work, is helping us to further clarify the fundamental role that empathy plays in our moral sensibilities. Hume’s work, written over two hundred and fifty years ago, is still profoundly relevant. But great artists have always seemed to know what Hume knew; they hook us up to the empathy machine when we become too self-involved, too isolated. For the most part, artists, not philosophers, keep us human; they can put us—no, sometimes force us—into the other person’s shoes. We see what it is like to be a victim a war, we see what it is like to be terribly conflicted, we see what it was like to be trapped inside the World Trade Center on 9/11. Artists can also expose our horror for what it is; we get a look inside the heads of those who know no empathy: the psychopaths, the sociopaths, the narcissists. Sometimes, we even get to see what it is like to live in an entire society that has gone the way of a psychopath. Once again, Bosch and Michelangelo come to mind, or, more recently, Cormac McCarthy’s novel, The Road. “ Dab Zabooty: Without empathy art becomes a technical exercise. Tristan Xavier Köster: In German there is this word “Sympathie” (not to be confused with sympathy) which basically means that you can understand and empathize with somebody(always used positively). I think that this sensation of Sympathie, finds itself in nearly all forms of art, allowing complete strangers to feel and see/hear with the artist. ‪Empathy (veiled by a sense of guilt) fuels just about every single melody I write, but I always try and make sure that my music is “sympathisch” to the listener. Joseph Bravo: Genuine aesthetic communication rests on empathy between the artist and the viewer. If art is to maintain some intrinsic cultural relevance then the audience indeed needs to be broadened. With that broadening of the audience must also come a broadening of the messages and the identity of the messengers as well, even at the risk of a disquieting cacophony. But ideally, each artist would be endeavoring to expand that empathic communication to edify as wide a range of humanity as possible. If artists are to speak with their audience rather that merely at it, then they should seek to find at least a point of common ground on which to plant that seed of empathy. Conor Walton: Empathy assumes reciprocal emotional relations between artist, subject and viewer that are egalitarian insofar as each can identify with the other, and this might naturally be expected to form the basis of an egalitarian art. It might suit a modern style of portraiture or figure painting which takes human equality for granted, but most of the great artworks of the past were produced in a different social context, and embody power relations and notions of social hierarchy that obstruct empathic relations. Are they to be admired less as a consequence? Is a contemporary work that expresses empathy superior to an ancient masterpiece that doesn’t? Or might it be the reverse: that cultivating empathy leads towards an urbane, popular, sentimental art, but places the highest summits of achievement off limits because of its antipathy to the sublime? Vonn Sumner: Empathy is the most important, most essential, most foundational element of painting and drawing. Empathy was the guiding principle of Wayne Thiebaud’s teaching, and he would often state it plainly. He would also say that empathy is the basis of civilization and quote Gloria Steinham: “Empathy is the most radical human emotion.” Joao de Brito: A Portuguese Proverb:”O artista é a voz do povo” or “ artists are the voice of the people” empathy is what is channeled by many artists to express what needs to seen or heard from the public when the world is in confusion. Ingrid Reeve: My art is not about progress; it’s about truth. Empathy is essential for discerning truth. Note: The original Facebook post and all replies can be viewed at this link.

"By Charley Locke for WIRED.  True-crime investigations, fictional radio shows set in small towns, long-form obsessive pursuits of a reclusive fitness gurus — the biggest hits in podcasting in recent years have taken a lot of varied forms. But the latest one trying to jolt the industry is doing it using an even more unlikely genre than most: musical theater. On the surface, 36 Questions, which stars Hamilton alum Jonathan Groff, is a narrative podcast about a couple working out their marital issues through song. But for producers Zack Akers and Skip Bronkie, who produced the 2013 fiction podcast Limetown, it’s the first step towards a podcast channel built around experimentation. It’s the start of a master plan to lure listeners away from long podcast series and into a sprawling ecosystem of audio aimed at evolving what podcasts can be. “There’s an unlimited amount of ways to go right now, because the podcast form is so young and so pliable,” says Akers. “How can you mix up the form, how do you mess with the audience in an interesting way?” Akers and Bronkie first worked together as college roommates, studying film and TV at Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. After graduating, they went their separate ways: Bronkie worked as a creative director at Facebook and Pinterest; Akers produced sports documentaries. But 10 years later, in 2013, Akers came to Bronkie with an idea for a way to do the kind of work they’d pursued as undergrads without having to secure a Hollywood budget. “Standing on my train going to work, everyone on my subway car has headphones in: This is an audience,” says Akers. “So I called Skip and said we should do a fictional podcast and treat it like a film.” Bronkie, who had just read World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War, was game. His suggestion: An oral history podcast. RELATED: MISSING RICHARD SIMMONS IS GRIPPING. AND ALSO KINDA ICKY The team spent the next year writing and producing Limetown, a six-episode story about a town where all 327 inhabitants disappeared. Today, there are dozens of fiction podcasts: Homecoming, The Bright Sessions, four shows from the Night Vale Presents network alone. But when Limetown launched in July 2015, a reporter or researcher hunting through found footage wasn’t yet a trope. The show quickly developed a devoted following, making it to No. 1 on the iTunes charts. While producing Limetown, Bronkie quit his day job at Pinterest and decided to pursue their company, Two-Up Productions, full-time. For filmmakers, the cost of audio fiction — voice actors, studio space, sound engineers — seemed like a bargain. “It’s less costly than producing a television series or film,” says Bronkie. “Without the visual aspect, you can go into the studio for a single day and come out with a half-hour episode.” His tech background came in handy, too: Thanks to his time working at lucrative tech companies, the two were able to self-finance the $90,000 season of Limetown, recouping the costs afterwards through ads, a prequel novel, and optioning the TV rights to IMG. From Mimicking Movies to Mimicking Musicals After the success of Limetown, the pair went looking for something to create the same impact. Their solution? A musical. “When Skip suggested it, I laughed — why would we ever do a musical?” says Akers. “But I knew because I was scared and it was so different that it was what we needed to do as a company.” For a storyline, they landed on a couple using “The Experimental Generation of Interpersonal Closeness,” a list of 36 questions popularized by a 2015 “Modern Love” column, as a last-ditch effort to save their marriage. And because Limetown owed so much of its success to Akers and Bronkie’s experience as filmmakers, they turned to experts for 36 Questions’ musical aspects, bringing on composers Ellen Winter and Chris Littler, who spent the next 18 months writing it. READ MORE: APPLE’S NEW TRANSPARENCY IS HUGE FOR PODCASTS EVERYWHERE Writing a podcast musical was a unique challenge — even for Winter and Littler, who play together in Chamber Band, a project Littler describes as creating “story-oriented songs in established universes”. (Previous albums include Deities, where songs take place in Dungeons & Dragons, and Careers, set in the world of The Hunger Games.) An audio-only musical posed limitations: They had to cut a narrator role and an ensemble; they decided not to feature more than two voices in a scene, so listeners can track dialogue; they integrated orchestration into the action. (At one point, Groff’s character asks his wife to turn off a record player, thereby letting the audience know the couple doesn’t just have a string section playing live in their living room.) But the podcast format also had benefits. A typical Broadway cast recording sounds as it would from an orchestra seat: like the actors are singing 30 feet away. In a podcast, it sounds like you’re in the room with the actors. With exposition and dialogue interspersed with the songs, 36 Questions sounds like a little bit of both. “It’s very immersive — your ears are in the space with the characters,” says Winter. “It’s as if you’re on stage with the actors, surrounded by them,” adds Littler. Playing to the Base The journey of 36 Questions will end on July 24, after a three-episode run. That’s a short series by podcast standards, but Akers and Bronkie hope it’s enough to lure listeners in — and keep them around. To that end, they’re not releasing the episodes on a separate 36 Questions feed in iTunes, but rather on Two-Up’s podcast channel. That way listeners who subscribe to Two-Up for 36 Questions will automatically get whatever the company works on next. “Doing everything on one channel means we can keep a loyal fanbase,” says Bronkie. “You now have a home for these riskier, weirder ideas.” RELATED: TRUE CRIME PODCASTS BRING CLOSURE—AND MAYBE EVEN REFORM Podcast producers usually don’t pursue one-episode projects; one-offs make it hard to build a following and climb the iTunes popularity charts. When producers have successfully made shorter seasons, it’s often as part of a broader series with existing name recognition, like The Heart’s four-episode mini-series on sexual abuse. What Two-Up is doing is different. Akers and Bronkie want their feed to use a variety-channel approach, retaining listeners who like their style while experimenting with genres that don’t fit into the serialized mold. Two-Up’s next project, for example, is a 75-minute “audio film” about weather vane thieves, ham radios, and “flawed characters making bad choices in 1979 rural Maine,” out at the end of 2017. And because of the relative cheapness of podcast production, they can try a lot of things and draw in new ears along the way. “The entry point of indie filmmaking is so high — it’s so hard to reach an audience of significance,” says Akers. “Podcasting, with this channel, cuts through a lot of that, and gets to a bigger audience very quickly.” They’re cagey about future podcast ideas beyond the feature-length project, but committed to experimentation — and to maintaining a filmmaker’s perspective. “We want to make something that sounds like a movie for your ears, cinematic and rich,” says Bronkie. To find out what that sounds like beyond musicals and found footage mysteries, you’ll just have to re-up Two-Up.

"From Crystal Gammon, OurAmazingPlanet Contributor: Two millennia ago, millions of giant tortoises roamed Madagascar, an island nation off the southeastern coast of Africa that is rich in species found nowhere else on Earth. Those tortoises kept Madagascar's unique ecosystem in check by munching on low-lying foliage, trampling vegetation and dispersing large seeds from native trees like the baobab. When humans began settling on the island about 2,300 years ago, Madagascar's large vertebrate populations were the first casualties. Dozens of species disappeared altogether, including 17 giant lemurs, three pygmy hippopotamuses, two aardvarklike mammals, a giant fossa (a catlike carnivore), eight elephant birds, a giant crocodile and two giant tortoises. With their demise, the composition of Madagascar's ecosystems changed, shrubs and vegetation clogged the forest floor and wildfires became more frequent and intense. Now, researchers think they've found a way to replace Madagascar's lost giant tortoise species: Bring in some relatives, says Miguel Pedrono, a Madagascar-based conservation biologist with the French agricultural research center CIRAD. Pedrono's team has identified a very close relative of the extinct giant tortoises, and they plan to transplant a few hundred of them to Madagascar to help fill the ecological gaps left by their extinct kin. ""This project is not an ecological substitution with an analogous species, like what's been done on other Indian Ocean islands; instead, it's a real reintroduction — the first one of a megafauna species here,"" Pedrono said. ""This will open fantastic perspectives for conservation in Madagascar."" [In Photos: Wacky Madagascar Animals] Ecological shoes to fill Using fossils from two species of extinct Madagascan giant tortoises, Pedrono located a group of very similar giant tortoises living on the nearby Aldabra Atoll. The Aldabra giant tortoise's appearance is nearly identical to that of the extinct Madagascan tortoise, and preliminary DNA studies show they're also very similar genetically, Pedrono said. In fact, it's likely that ancestors of the giant tortoises living on Aldabra Atoll made the 249-mile (400 kilometers) swim from Madagascar about 100,000 years ago — the blink of an eye, evolutionarily speaking. Since the tortoises are so similar morphologically and genetically, it's likely they'll fill the same roles in the Madagascan ecosystem, Pedrono said. Madagascar currently has no large animals capable of swallowing and dispersing large seeds, such as those from the baobab tree. Without their crucial landscaping services, including grazing on plants and leaf litter, biomass builds up on the forest floor and frequently causes wildfires. In addition, many of Madagascar's plants have evolved defenses against large herbivores, such as spines and multiple leaf shapes that protect young sprouts from browsing tortoises. These so-called evolutionary anachronisms could disappear altogether if no species can fill the giant tortoise's shoes, Pedrono said. To help the Aldabra giant tortoises take over for their extinct kin, Pedrono's team plans to move 300 young tortoises to a nature reserve in western Madagascar, where they'll live in an enclosed pen for five years. That will give researchers a chance to monitor their eating habits and other ecological interactions before the tortoises can breed and disperse across the island. A 'welcome breakthrough' The plan seems like a good one, says Elizabeth Hunter, an ecologist at the University of Georgia who has studied giant tortoise restoration on the Galapagos Islands but wasn't involved in Pedrono's research. ""I would fully support going forward with this plan,"" Hunter said. ""Of course, any time you introduce a species, there are many potential pitfalls, but this plan is cautious and will allow researchers to discover those before anything goes too wrong."" Giant tortoises are good species with which to start testing these sorts of ecological replacements, Hunter said. They're very easy to contain with fencing and easy to monitor with tracking devices, and most diseases they could carry are species-specific, meaning they likely wouldn't infect other wildlife. Pedrono's team plans to do thorough veterinary checks to make sure the new tortoises aren't bringing invasive plants or exotic diseases with them to Madagascar. Similar plans to replace missing giant tortoises have been carried out in several locations, including Seychelles and the Mascarene Islands, and ""researchers have seen very good success everywhere,"" Pedrono told LiveScience's OurAmazingPlanet. Replacement tortoises on the Mascarene Island of Rodrigues are restoring seed dispersal and grazing patterns after only seven years on the island. The giant-tortoise-replacement scheme could also be a boon for Madagascar's ecotourism industry, Pedrono said. ""Visitors, residents and conservationists are all hungry for successful new conservation initiatives,"" Pedrono wrote in the March issue of the journal Biological Conservation. ""Based on its considerable success elsewhere and the optimistic prospects for Madagascar, this proposed giant-tortoise translocation could represent a welcome breakthrough in the struggle to retain and restore the unique biological riches of Madagascar.""

"Call it Cavalia 2.0 if you wish. With 120 permanent employees, 65 horses (40 of which perform in most shows), 365 costumes, a 125-foot tall Big Top that seats more than 2,000 spectators, 200 moving lights, 19 projectors, a 17,500-square foot stage made from 10,000 tons of dirt, sand, and stone, and a man-made 40,000-gallon lake, Odysseo is a knockout production worth seeing as much for its horses, acrobats, aerialists, trick riders, and dancers as for its design, stagecraft, and use of current technology. Unlike the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus (which moves its two shows around the country each year in specialized 60-car trains), transporting Odysseo between cities requires 100 vehicles, eight shower stalls for the horses, and a 250-ton crane to lift the 70-ton technical grid into place. Over a year's time, Odysseo's horses will eat 18,000 bales of hay, 18.7 tons of grain, and 1,800 pounds of carrots. Odysseo is the creation of Cavalia's founder and artistic director, Normand Latourelle, whose dreams have been brought to fruition with the help of director Wayne Fowkes, set designer Guillaume Lord, costume designers Georges Lévesque and Michele Hamel, lighting designer Alain Lortie, and a team of choreographers (Darren Charles, Elsie Morin, Mathieu Roy, and Alain Gauthier). Michele Hamel (who worked on designing the costumes for Odysseo with the late Georges Lévesque) explains that: The gymnasts have several costume changes during the show: one is a free interpretation of African pants. Some of the trousers were inspired by Asian and Chinese tribes and, of course, we wanted colors. The costumes had to be very comfortable and not slippery because the gymnasts (who are originally from Guinea, Africa) do lots of very tricky moves. The durability of the fabrics (with regard to frequency of use and strength of movement) was a constant concern because the costumes will be on tour for a long time. The challenge in the conception of the costume for riders is to create something that will be original and lasting even when noble fabrics are used. We had to find a fabric that looked like silk, but was resistant to water, with nice colors and not too stiff. For this show we used stretch linen and faux fur. The first time we tried one of the costumes for the female riders in Nomads, the horse was scared by the fluffy sleeves of the corsage until he came near and smelled it and probably discovered it was not a living animal.  A scene from Odysseo (Photo by: Color-ish Company) Whether one thinks of stage spectacles produced by Cirque du Soleil, some of the world's great opera companies, or scenic elements which have become trademarks of some Andrew Lloyd-Webber musicals (the giant truck tire in Cats, the falling chandelier in The Phantom of the Opera), the creative team for Odysseo came up with one sequence which I don't expect anyone to surpass in the near future. Toward the end of Act I, a fully-functioning carousel descends from the grid above the main stage. As some of the male acrobats perform on the carousel poles, it continues to slowly spin around, creating a breathtaking display of art, gymnastics, and showmanship.  The carousel sequence from Odysseo (Photo by: Shelley Paulson) Because digital scanning technology has come so far since the first production of  Cavalia: A Magical Encounter Between Human and Horse in 2003, the visual design by GEODEZIK for Odysseo is nothing less than breathtaking. Whether one is watching the horses perform in a countryside where the mountains seem to dance from one side of the stage to another -- or seeing the giant head sculptures (moai) from Easter Island zoom up in size, as if to say ""We're ready for our close-up, Mr. DeMille!"" -- the visuals are remarkably rich. My favorite sequence takes place in the African desert and savanna, with flocks of birds flying out of the trees as the seasons slowly change from spring to summer and winter.  Horses performing in Odysseo's watery finale
(Photo by: François Bergeron)  The real stars of Odysseo are, of course, the horses. In the first scene, I was dazzled by the beauty of a black and white American paint horse. One of my favorite moments in the show is a quiet segment at the top of Act II which begins with the horses lying down with their riders and trainers. One by one, the audience sees the horses rock from side to side on their backs until they gain enough momentum to get into a position from which they can stand up.  Horses surround the African acrobats in Odysseo
(Photo by: François Bergeron)  It would be folly to ignore the sheer athleticism of Odysseo. In addition to the riders and trainers, there are two sets of acrobats. The Africans do some jaw-dropping stunts and interact with the audience during a musical chant that asks for an end to war. The white acrobats draw gasps of astonishment with their displays of powerbocking on spring-loaded jumping stilts similar to the ones used in the following video. What amazes me about Odysseo is how efficiently its creative team has managed to fill the vertical as well as horizontal space in front of the audience. From acrobats gallivanting across the stage on jumping stilts to muscular male gymnasts doing poetic pole dances, from nine male aerialists simultaneously performing on hoops above the stage to a cluster of angelic women being lifted on high, the spectacle is stunning. Throw in a carousel that can be raised and lowered on cables and you've got yourself quite a show. As if all the talent on display were not enough, when it comes to eye candy there is a veritable banquet of beefcake with plenty of biceps, triceps, and abs to feed an audience's fantasies.

"The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department has once again changed its timeline of the tragic mass shooting carried out by Stephen Paddock from a corner suite at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino on Oct. 1. Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said during a Friday night press conference that Paddock shot at a hotel security guard around the same time he was firing on the music festival ― not six minutes before firing at the concert, as was previously believed. This is the second time this week that police announced a change to the timeline of events for the shooting.  Lombardo had announced another revision on Monday that police believed that Paddock shot hotel security guard Jesus Campos at 9:59 p.m. and began shooting at the festival six minutes later at 10:05 p.m. That timeline replaced the original belief held soon after the shooting that Paddock stopped his attack on the festival because Campos approached the door to his 32nd-floor hotel suite. MGM Resorts International, Mandalay Bay’s parent company, publicly rejected Monday’s revised timeline, arguing that the police had based their revision on a report manually created by the hotel “after the fact without the benefit of information we now have.” MGM offered their own timeline on Thursday, saying that “shots were being fired at the festival lot at the same time, or within 40 seconds after” Campos first reported shots fired over the radio. Lombardo said on Friday that police investigators now agree with MGM’s timeline after reviewing additional information.  “The information was obtained via security logs, Officer Campos himself, body worn cameras, hotel cameras...LVMPD dispatch, hotel and private cameras and interviews,” Lombardo said on Friday. Lombardo clarified on Friday that Campos had encountered a barricaded stairwell door near Paddock’s room at 9:59 p.m., but wasn’t shot, as police believed Monday. Sgt. Joshua Bitsko told CNN that the door had been intentionally screwed shut by Paddock.  In order to gain access the 32nd floor, Campos had to go up the stairwell one more floor, then head back down one floor. He approached Paddock’s suite at about 10:05 p.m., which was when police believe Paddock shot Campos through the door. Paddock then fired at the festival for 10 minutes, according to Lombardo.  Police reached Paddock’s suite at 10:17 p.m., 12 minutes after Campos was shot. According to MGM, Campos had been responding to an alarm set off by an open door that was on the same floor as Paddock. Lombardo also said Friday that Paddock checked into a free room offered by the Mandalay Bay hotel on Sept. 25 and he stayed there until Sept. 28, when he moved to a corner suite which he paid for. He added his girlfriend’s name, Marilou Danley, to that reservation. Paddock also attempted to shoot nearby aviation fuel tanks, likely to distract first responders during an attempted getaway, Lombardo said. Officials are still looking for a motive in the devastating shooting, which killed at least 58 people and wounded hundreds of others.  Police have sent Paddock’s brain to “an appropriate evaluation facility” in order to look for microscopic anomalies, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. Officials found nothing unusual during an initial visual autopsy of the brain. Lombardo appeared defensive and emotional during Friday’s press conference.  “There is no conspiracy between the FBI, the LVMPD and the MGM. Nobody is trying to hide anything in reference to this investigation,” Lombardo said. “The dynamics and size of this investigation requires us to go through voluminous amounts of information in order to draw an accurate picture.” The sheriff held back tears toward the end of Friday’s news conference as he spoke of the police officers who were wounded substantially during the shooting. Lombardo said he believed that Paddock targeted police officers as they arrived on the scene to protect the public. “The response of those individuals, I believe, saved lives,” Lombardo said after describing the injuries that Officer Brady Cook had sustained. “And the reason I bring this one up, he asked me if he could go back to work today.”",that,responding,Paddock
"Uber has fired 20 employees as part of a larger inquiry into harassment claims, the company confirmed to HuffPost. The firings came after an independent law firm completed an investigation into 215 human resources claims, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. Of the 215 claims, 100 resulted in no action; 31 required employees to receive additional training; seven prompted written warnings; and 57 are still being investigated. Uber announced the firings at an all-hands on Tuesday, according to The New York Times. Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is leading a separate investigation into sexual harassment and discrimination claims at company. Uber board member Arianna Huffington, the former editor-in-chief of HuffPost, is helping oversee Holder’s probe. That investigation has concluded, but has yet to be publicly addressed. In February, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler detailed her experiences at the company in a revealing blog post, describing what she says was a nightmarish, sexist work environment. Fowler wrote that her superior propositioned her for sex. When she reported the incident to Uber HR, Fowler says her claims were dismissed and she was instructed to either find another team to work for or accept negative performance reviews in the future. The post prompted Uber CEO Travis Kalanick to call for an internal investigation. On Monday, Uber human resources chief Liane Hornsey told USA Today the greatest sources of internal dissatisfaction at the company are pay and pride, not sexual harassment. “[Fowler’s] blog shocked me,” Hornsey said. “But, what did surprise me, was when I did the listening sessions, this didn’t come up as an issue. It wasn’t one of our big themes. Other things came up that are in that area, that our values are masculine and a little aggressive, but the harassment issue, I just didn’t find that at all.” Fowler criticized Hornsey’s findings on Twitter as “more of the same old gaslighting from Uber HR.” The former Uber engineer also used Tuesday’s firings to cast doubt on the company’s ability to scrutinize itself. Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",Hornsey,said,me
"UPDATE: April 10 ― Sinclair Broadcast Group has bookended Allied Progress’ ads critical of the company with brief statements defending itself as “a source for truthful news.”  “This station, which is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group, is proud to present both sides of issues,” the company says in a voiceover before the Allied Progress spot that has aired on four stations. “For that reason, we have agreed to air the commercial you are about to see opposing Sinclair’s acquisition of additional television stations. We think the ad is misleading but wanted to let you decide.” “The ad was purchased by a group known for its liberal bias,” the voiceover continues after the spot. “We hope you won’t buy into the hysteria and hype.”  Allied’s executive director, Karl Frisch, said Sinclair did not contact Allied before inserting the disclaimers. Although the group expected the ads to begin airing last Friday, they did not begin until the weekend. “That we are a progressive consumer watchdog dedicated to holding special interests accountable is something we wear proudly on our sleeves. We’re clear about who we are. Sinclair is not,” Frisch said in a statement. “By claiming ‘both sides’ and attacking a critic’s liberal politics, they are acknowledging they actively disseminate partisan conservative propaganda, something clearly at odds with their repeated claims to the contrary.” PREVIOUSLY: The viral video showing a dizzying array of local news anchors reciting the same script authored by their stations’ conservative owner, the Sinclair Broadcasting Group, is coming soon to the homes of Sinclair customers across the country. That is, if the broadcaster doesn’t reject it first.  Allied Progress, a left-leaning consumer watchdog group based in Washington, D.C., borrows the alarming mashup for a new 30-second spot that takes aim at Sinclair, which is under fire for requiring journalists to read a statement last month parroting some of the anti-media language used by President Donald Trump.  Allied said Thursday it has sunk six figures into an ad buy on four stations in the Sinclair network: ABC affiliates WJLA in Washington and KOMO in Seattle, and Fox affiliates KDSM in Des Moines and WBFF in Baltimore, which also happens to be Sinclair’s flagship station.  The spot was slated to run a total of about 175 times over the course of one week, beginning Friday, Allied Progress Executive Director Karl Frisch told HuffPost Thursday.  Frisch noted Friday that Allied is still working with Sinclair to schedule the ad space and hopes to have the ads begin over the weekend. He confirmed that ads in Des Moines are set to begin running Saturday afternoon. However, the Seattle station has yet to grant final approval on the spot. Sinclair did not return a request for comment about the ad. Frisch said Thursday that an uptick in contributions to Allied may allow it to purchase even more airtime ― if it’s allowed. “It is certainly a test for the company,” Frisch said. While it’s been silent on the ad buy so far, Sinclair could still refuse to air it.  Reaching 40 percent of U.S. households, Sinclair is the nation’s largest owner of local TV stations and is poised to greatly expand its influence. If the company is successful in its bid to overtake Tribune Media, it will reach an estimated 72 percent of U.S. households. The deal is currently under review by the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice.  Allied’s spot urges viewers to contact the FCC and demand it shut down the merger. The commission’s inspector general, David Hunt, is already investigating whether its chairman, Ajit Pai, has acted improperly to benefit Sinclair regarding the deal. Sinclair faced sharp criticism in the past week after a video showed dozens of its local news anchors warning viewers about “the troubling trend of irresponsible, one-sided news stories plaguing our country” including the “sharing of biased and false news.” “The problem with what Sinclair does is they co-opt the credibility that local anchors have built up in their communities over years and decades,” Aaron Weiss, a former Sinclair news director, told CNN Wednesday.  Some current Sinclair journalists have also spoken out against the script ― one of the company’s many conservative “must-run” segments ― but others fear backlash from their employer. The company’s leadership emphatically defended its decision, which also garnered praise from the president himself.",it,said,airtime
"Like many uninformed people, Steve Bannon mistakenly identifies Catholicism with one minor historical feature of an even more narrow slice of Catholicism: the institutional Church. It is an historical fact that institutional Catholicism flourished for a time on the Western European cultural foundation. That same culture led to the greatest corruption and abuses of power that nearly destroyed the Catholic Church. And here we are, reading reports that Steve Bannon thinks the Catholic Church should be a proving-ground for reinstatement of Western European culture’s domination of all other global cultures. How fascinating. Did any of the cultural forms of Western European Catholicism prevent the rape of children? Did not the secrecy and patriarchy provide a cover for the worst crisis since the Reformation? I suppose that is an incendiary question so let me ask another. How many young adults would get out of bed on a Sunday morning to go to Church to hear Steve Bannon’s clerical alter-ego Cardinal Burke preside and preach? Can we name one parish that is better off because of leaders like Cardinal Burke? In my experience, Catholics who do attend regular Mass do so in spite of their local bishop not because of him. Of course there are exceptions, as we know, that just proves the rule. I know whereof I speak. I am the mother of 3 young adults and I spend most of everyday with 70+ in my classroom. I also work with the parents, mostly mothers, of young adult Catholics. During the Christmas season I had a compelling conversation with two bright, talented, disaffected Catholic young women. Their mother has attended my weekly study in the Catholic Tradition for parents at the Sacred Heart Schools here in Silicon Valley for over ten years now. Skilled in graciousness, Vicky said to me, “So tell me about Pope Francis? Love him!” And we were off and running, listening and speaking to each other about our experiences as American Catholic women. Vicky, and her sister Alex, at the cusp of their professional lives and me 40+ years into mine. So much more theologically astute than Steve Bannon and his ilk, these women know that the parish life and Christian service of people like their mother is the actual center of gravity for Catholicism. Popes and bishops and pastors come and go; the pilgrim people, serving Jesus’ Gospel and gathering around his table endures. Their mother is representative of the women who have been pondering the great Catholic tradition as a service of their children’s Catholic school. There was a time when the bishops would have made sure such a program happened in the parish. In the absence of parish leadership, Catholic schools, especially those run by religious orders, have stepped into the breach to support parents in the faith formation of their children. At Sacred Heart Schools in Atherton, California, we started with McBrien’s classic Catholicism and have moved through rich, sophisticated texts in a kind of Catholic-Book Club. The regulars now know theology better than many who have Master’s level training. The academic pedigrees in the room are impressive. They have degrees from the University of Michigan, Stanford, Harvard and Cal Berkeley. I am happy to say that both Santa Clara and my beloved alma mater, the University of Notre Dame are also represented. They have run companies and boards; most are very involved in philanthropy. All do some form of very concrete service. Unlike Steve Bannon whose Catholic identity seems to reside only in a rigid conceptualism, these women are Catholic in their bones. What does it mean to be Catholic in your bones? It means that the way you live expresses what you believe. It means that the institutional forms serve Jesus’ Gospel. It means that Catholic ideas do not stay at the level of the intellect, they animate behavior; they enable critical thinking about actual human questions, such as how you spend your money, manage your hurt feelings, direct your desires, how you vote. Steve Bannon seems utterly ignorant of how institutional forms function. They act as the little “codes” or packages of meaning; they both express and nourish our self-understanding as Catholics who strive to love God and serve the people whom God loves. The word “Catholic” refers to a rich matrix. It is a way of life, an historical organization, a subset of the Christian community, an ancient, global institution as well as a cluster of religious practices and forms. Prayers are Catholic and so are summer camps. And so is the pope. Pope Francis serves a ministry in the Catholic tradition; he is not the Catholic version of an Emperor. We know where Bannon might have arrived at that notion; there have been popes who tried to function as imperial rulers just as their have been local pastors who have done so. Vicky is correct; Pope Francis is indeed appealing. Warm and delightful as he surely appears to be, personality alone does not a great leader make. Just recall Pope Benedict’s pontificate: an introverted, contemplative man, his affect impeded some of his richest teachings. And Pope John Paul II, his robust personality and deep personal spirituality masked authoritarian features that the Catholic Church is still wrangling with, not the least of which is his appointment of apparatchiks as bishops rather than strong, creative leaders. Pope Francis’ warmth is refreshing but my confidence in him is generated by his explicit behaviors toward the implementation of Catholicism’s vision. That vision was codified in the Documents of Vatican II. The bottom line for Vatican II was shedding the Western-European foundation for Catholic identity in order to re-engineer a truly global Church. No longer carried by a Western culture, the Catholic Church still grows from the seed Jesus’ Gospel but that seed will bear Asian, African, and Latin American fruit, not an imported Church but a native one. Just like a jihadist of ISIS is ignorant of Islam’s actual understanding of the relationship between the human community and the Living God, Steve Bannon too, is theologically illiterate. He may be able to conjure some “codes” but codes disconnected from an essential vision are meaningless. One such code was making the sign of the cross or reciting a “Hail Mary” when you heard an ambulance’s siren. If we do that but do not vote for health care access for all Americans, we vacate any meaning that little package of care seeks to codify and display. These codes often come in the form of doctrines. Many Catholics are quite ignorant of just what Catholic “doctrine” actually is. The term comes from the Latin and means teaching. Anyone who has ever taught anything, from teaching a child to read, to tie her shoes, to play baseball, knows that there are many levels of teaching. The purpose is to provide tools for behavior. Whether you use the bunny ears method or the two loops method to describe the key to well-tied shoes varies with the teacher. What does not vary is whether or not the shoes stay tied. When Pope Francis “teaches” he seems to be actually paying attention to the people looking for wisdom about their life with God. At least, that is what I hear; that is certainly what Vicky and Alex think. Vicky and Alex are drawn to Pope Francis because he seems kind; he seems to be comfortable around women and to even have worked well with women. What is more important, that young women like Vicky and Alex feel valued by the Church or that they can recite 19th-century Western prayer forms? As they come to their own experiences of love and intimacy, does the Church offer them life-giving ways to think about marriage and family life or does it constantly tell them that sexual longing is just a necessary trick their bodies play on them so that they will become mothers? That the deep intimacy that sexual expression nourishes is merely secondary, and far less important? Even more important than his inviting presence, Pope Francis is distinctive because he is aggressively implementing the reforms of Vatican II. These visionary texts are the best-kept secrets of the Catholic tradition. Vatican II marked the end of the Western-European identity for the Catholic Church. We still live with its ghost but that is all that it is: a vapor, fading fast while the living Church is walking the streets, filling the schools, and in some places, re-animating the liturgy as well as Catholic social institutions. The Church is also found in the savannahs of Africa as well as cities and towns all over Latin America and Asia. Ideologies may animate small factions; only a vision animates a whole people. Vatican II re-imagined the essential vision of Jesus’ Gospel in the actual global, modern world. Along with that renewed vision came new doctrines, new ways to teach. Jesus’ expansive understanding of table-fellowship did not change, but the doctrines, the ways we express the vision and communicate it, did indeed. The Church’s self-understanding as servant to the entire human community did not change; its expression of just how to fulfill that service did indeed. Doctrines always serve a broader vision. Of course we need institutional forms so that we can learn the wisdom of the tradition that has proclaimed and served Jesus’ vision for centuries. (I could have used someone who knew the bunny ears image for shoe-tying!) But the institutional forms have to stay in their lane, so to speak. One of the greatest tragedies in Catholic history is when the pope’s ministry of unity was transformed into the office of a monarchical, imperial ruler. We are still trying to shed the vestiges of the empire in the institutional Catholic Church. Since the first moments of his pontificate, Pope Francis has been dismantling the carapace of that feudal, hierarchical form. All over the Church, we have been shedding the husks of cultural forms that worked in a previous era but suffocate us today. Vatican II’s documents laid out the plan long since. I am not worried about Pope Francis. His vision is clear and he has the great Catholic Tradition like a strong wind at his back.",it,mean,bones
"Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani made an eyebrow-raising statement Friday, when he told CNN anchor Chris Cuomo that the president of the United States can be found guilty of obstructing justice.  Asked explicitly whether any president can obstruct justice, Giuliani replied: “He can.” The statement reverses a claim made by John Dowd, a now-former lawyer for President Donald Trump, who told Axios in December that the president cannot obstruct justice.  “[H]e is the chief law enforcement officer under [the Constitution’s Article II] and has every right to express his view of any case,” Dowd told the outlet at the time.  Giuliani joined Trump’s legal team about one month after Dowd announced his resignation in late March. Legal experts have debated the merits of Dowd’s argument. Many disagree with it ― including Giuliani, at least for the moment.  The debate is increasingly relevant as Trump’s team seems to be taking an increasingly confrontational approach to special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe that may include positing that the president simply cannot be charged with any of the crimes being investigated. Mueller is reportedly zeroing in on a few key issues, including possible obstruction. Mueller’s appointment was triggered by Trump’s decision to fire FBI Director James Comey on May 9, 2017, Giuliani told Cuomo on Friday. The former mayor also said, “The president has complete discretion to fire anybody he wants.” But he stressed that there was “zero evidence” to justify the investigation in the first place. In an interview on May 11, 2017, Trump conceded he had considered the “Russia thing” when he decided to fire Comey, prompting questions over whether obstruction charges could apply.

"After being inundated with the stories of the rich and/or famous being removed from their perches of prominence due to sexual harassment claims, so many of us have considered the innumerable women who have been harassed by the more quotidian members of our society. There won’t be any New York Times or New Yorker exposes that detail how a paralegal was repeatedly rubbed up against by a law partner in the break room, or how a new teacher was told by the assistant principal that if she wanted to keep her job she should consider engaging in a more physical relationship with him. These types of horrifying and demeaning incidents have been occurring to women of all ages and backgrounds for years, and no one can claim ignorance—see the depiction of sexual harassment in films, books and other forms of cultural entertainment. We all know the reality. The recent spate of hard-hitting reporting and swift actions in forcing resignations, suspensions and other punitive consequences on well-known offenders—from Bill O’Reilly to Mark Halperin to Leon Wieseltier—has forced so many of us to revisit our own experiences in the past. It has also allowed us to consider our present and what standards we will accept and not accept going forward, now that we feel we’ve gotten the public’s attention on this crucial matter. It seems like a good time to extend the conversation to focus on women’s experiences, not just with co-workers who are in positions of power but in general encounters in other parts of their lives. As a long-time New York resident, I had been following with interest the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s (MTA) pilot “Courtesy Campaign,” which made available free buttons to aid individuals in securing a seat on the subway. One button read “Baby on Board,” designed for pregnant woman, the other, “Please Offer Me a Seat,” could be deployed by anyone who needed to quit standing because of illness, age, or disability. I appreciated the MTA championing the cause of these specific groups of straphangers, and thought it was a clever approach to helping them more easily communicate their need to sit down, people who don’t feel comfortable asking for a seat can get buttons to do the talking for them. But it also made me think about the kind of courtesy that isn’t being extended on the subway or on the streets and that no campaign has taken on: the everyday harassment of women. We have seen exhortations to men to be aware of sexual harassment in the workplace and to call it out. What about standing up for women when they are the recipient of lewd comments on the street, so they don’t have to feel like they are walking a gauntlet, or on the subway so they don’t have to suffer silently as they wait for the next subway stop so they can escape the situation? The MTA’s campaign was unusual because unlike other MTA-type public service announcements that try to create a safe and efficient ride—don’t litter because garbage can cause track fires, or remove your backpack on the subway to make room for others—the courtesy campaign focused on acting in a way that was decent, or one might even say, ethical. It also sent the message that in New York we need an intermediary in the form of a sign or a button to help us act like good people. One explanation why people don’t intervene when women are being openly harassed is because this behavior has disturbingly become so commonplace in our society and therefore people barely register when it’s happening. On an individual level, perhaps people assume that it would be useless to get involved because anyone who would impose themselves on others wouldn’t be reasonable enough to understand why it it’s problematic. But a more likely reason is fear—fear that intervening could lead to unpleasant consequences like being yelled out, insulted or physically harmed. A goal for residents of a city in which we exist—and travel― in such close proximity is to develop norms in public spaces, like subways and streets, that reflect how we try to live in our private lives, where people are responsive to, and respectful of each other’s needs. In a city known for its individualism, let’s develop a more collective approach to creating safe spaces for everyone. There should be an unspoken campaign to ensure that people can’t harass women with impunity. No courtesy buttons should be necessary. Need help?

"NEW ORLEANS ― Federal authorities are looking into a cross-country crime spree that allegedly targeted dozens of men on dating apps and adult websites and left at least one person dead, according to a lawyer close to the case. The development comes just days after HuffPost detailed the account of Dominique Berry, 27, who claims she and her partner, 36-year-old Randy Schenck, committed the alleged crimes. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI have “opened an investigation,” attorney Michael Kennedy told HuffPost on Wednesday. Kennedy represents the family of Shawn Arthur, a 40-year-old man who was found dead in his Metairie, Louisiana, apartment in February 2017. Arthur’s death was labeled “accidental,” despite compelling evidence suggesting he was the victim of foul play. HuffPost on Friday published the results of an investigation into Arthur’s death, revealing Berry ― a Louisiana native with a lengthy criminal record ― met Arthur on a dating app and was the last to see him alive.  In a series of interviews, Berry related what she said really happened to Arthur, claiming she drugged him so that she and Schenck could steal his belongings.  “I didn’t know he was dead,” Berry said of Arthur. Berry and Schenck are jailed in Georgia pending further proceedings on charges stemming from a different incident. Her account, along with other evidence uncovered by HuffPost, shows how she and Schenck skipped across the country, allegedly targeting men on dating apps in at least six states. Berry estimates they victimized up to 100 men. Efforts to contact Schenck in jail or meet with him in person were unsuccessful. His attorney in Georgia, Kome Akpolo, said his client denies the charges and called Berry’s claims “allegations ― nothing more.” The Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office last month began taking a fresh look at Arthur’s death after HuffPost raised questions. Shane Jones, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana, said the office could not confirm or deny an investigation into the matter, in accordance with Department of Justice policy. Craig Betbeze, a spokesman for the FBI’s New Orleans field office, said he had “no comment” on the case. Dr. Marianna Eserman, the forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy that declared Arthur’s death accidental, is holding a conference this week to determine whether Arthur’s death certificate should be amended. “I asked if I could sit in on it and they would not allow it, so I asked them to notify me of the results,” said Kennedy, who hopes to hear the results sometime this week. Arthur’s father, Bob Arthur, 69, told HuffPost on Wednesday that he is frustrated with Jefferson Parish authorities. “It has been [two months] since they were notified there’s been a confession,” Bob Arthur said. “They’ve yet to extend us the courtesy of providing any information whatsoever. We have no idea what, if anything, they are actually doing.” Kennedy said he’s encouraged by the involvement of federal authorities. “We want justice for Shawn Arthur and all the victims,” Kennedy said. “This is chipping away at that block and getting us a step closer to that goal.” Send David Lohr an email or follow him on Facebook and Twitter.",they,estimates,men
"October signifies Breast Cancer Awareness month, bringing a powerful annual reminder for women everywhere to pause their daily life and bring health to the forefront by scheduling a yearly mammogram.   Along with this, Breast Cancer Awareness month is a time to remember friends and family who courageously lost their ordeal with breast cancer. It is a time to support the warriors who are managing cancer so bravely; a journey that takes a toll on both the human spirit and the body.  For women who undergo mastectomies and breast reconstruction, they face a daily reminder of scars. For some, no nipples are left behind after surgery.  But now, many survivors are turning to tattoos to cover the scar with a beautiful piece of artwork.  P.ink is one organization changing the culture of healing for breast cancer survivors.  In 2013, Noel Franus founded P.ink, which stands for ""personal ink,"" an organization that helps breast cancer survivors who have undergone mastectomies and breast reconstruction by connecting them with a tattoo artist. The artist works with the survivor to create tattoo designs to cover and hide scar tissue from such operations.  Noel stops by to share his personal connection with breast cancer and the inspiration behind P.ink.   JB: What inspired you to start this powerful recourse for breast cancer survivors? NF: It started when my sister-in-law Molly told the family she had breast cancer and was getting a double mastectomy. She asked friends and family for clever nipple-tattoo ideas, since her originals were going away, never to return, and she wasn't interested in the doctor's version of a nipple tattoo. Unfortunately there were no resources for someone thinking of doing anything different; despite the fact that millions have to deal with nipple replacements and mastectomy scars, there was no one place online for survivors and others to explore options other than traditional reconstruction. So I thought P.ink would be an effective solve for this unmet need. I brought the idea for P.ink to CP+B (the advertising agency I work at based in Boulder, Colorado). And then we got to work; our goal was to bring design to this underserved audience by showcasing mastectomy tattoos as an accessible, viable option for taking back some of the personal property that breast cancer can steal. That's the kind of brief that most creatives love to dig in to, so we attacked it. As for Molly: she's great. She's now one of our local leaders in L.A. We're so proud we were able to connect her with Colby Butler, who is a fantastic artist, and that Molly was able to bravely share her story with so many people. JB: Did you find it easy to find tattoo artists who were skilled in tattooing over scars? NF: Many artists cover scars but few have mastectomy experience. And skin that's been exposed to radiation can be a unique challenge. We've spent many nights and weekends looking for artists experienced with mastectomies, whom we trust. Just two years ago it was a lot harder to find them than it is today. And while a few of the heroes of the mastectomy tattoo universe are now easier to find online, not everyone can travel across the country or around the world to visit them for a mastectomy tattoo. So we've been searching for local, regional, national and international expertise. Fortunately this is slightly less burdensome now that artists are hearing about P.ink -- more of them are reaching out to us. JB: You recently held P.ink Day 2014. Please share more about this special day and how survivors and volunteers can get involved in P.ink Day 2015. NF: P.ink Day has grown into something very special in a short amount of time. We've managed to seed a movement that's grown from one location and 10 survivors in its first year to 12 locations and 38 survivors the next. (And in fact, we had to turn down about 40 potential locations this year for one reason or another -- lack of an experienced artist, lack of a truly organized ground team, we didn't have the largesse to support such a massive effort, etc.) What's made P.ink Day unique is that it's never just about a free tattoo; it's an all-out gift of a day, an outpouring of love, facilitated by local leaders and supported by dozens of other individuals working to make things just right. The tattoo is of course the pinnacle of the experience, but everything has to be incredibly well orchestrated, from the first moment we introduce the artist to their survivor, to the pre-party the night before, to the cheering squads applauding survivors in the morning, to the lunches, the tattooing and anything that follows.  I'm sure we put that pressure on ourselves, perhaps more than is necessary, but the thing we've always tried to do with P.ink is show an expertly focused lens on these survivors who often slip outside the limelight; they've beaten the disease, but still have to live with what it left behind. I don't much talk about them during the pink-cleats NFL games or the pink products being advertised every October. And yet they deserve our best efforts. This ethos drives everything P.ink does. The Pinterest boards are a deliberate act of curation and taste. The artists we've selected to feature and work with isn't a group of lightweights. The Inkspiration app wasn't something we cooked up overnight. So we try to reinforce that P.ink Day is a radical act of love, care and reclamation. And anyone who wants to help make a P.ink Day happen in their community must be incredibly motivated, clever and exceptionally well organized to pull it off. There's just no other way to go about it. As for next year: we're taking a breather at the moment and we're cooking up plans for 2015. We try to keep things creatively fresh. Last year we ran the crowdfunding campaign--we loved the idea that anyone could invest in healing art that's now walking the earth--and this year we drafted a playbook and coached local leaders as they made things happen. Stay tuned for our plans for 2015.  We encourage individuals, donors or other partners that want to help to reach out, email us at help@p-ink.org. JB:  What kind of feedback have you received from the women who have received tattoos?  NF: ""I'm finally comfortable looking in the mirror again."" ""I've got my sexy mojo back."" ""I might just start marching around topless."" Those are my favorite quotes from survivors we've worked with or heard from. Each survivor wants a tattoo for a different reason. While some, like Molly, just didn't like the idea of a doctor-created circle, others tried it and the work went south. Others tried reconstruction and it didn't take. Others felt newly awkward in the locker room with missing or scarred breasts. Others might have had a prophylactic mastectomy. And many others still felt like their sex appeal had disappeared. Some simply felt mutilated. To hear these unique stories, followed up with these quotes after all they've been through... and now they're stepping up and owning it... that's incredibly profound. It's very gratifying to be a part of this. JB: This has to be a powerful day for the artists as well. What feedback have you received from the artists?  NF: Great question. In our experience, most artists love this work. Two reasons why: 1) they're artists, so their empathy levels are often naturally through the roof; 2) this work elevates their role. This is the end of a long saga, one in which doctors, nurses, surgeons and other specialists shuffle you from one hospital room to the next over the course of years -- and standing at the end of this healthcare experience is who? A tattoo artist. There's the hero. That flips the broader cultural perception of tattoo artists on its head. Yes, there are many reasons why tattoo artists are often seen as the cultural rogue--sailors and riffraff and testosterone-fueled tattoo shows on TV only add to the cutting edge. But we've uncovered at least one of probably many reasons why the world sometimes needs to celebrate that cutting edge. And tweaking those cultural perceptions is part of what makes this so fun. JB: What have you learned about the human spirit through this experience?  NF: I've learned that most people respond enthusiastically when you can tap into their talents to help change a life. That's not always easy. Over the years I've found that volunteer work doesn't always demand your best. It often requires only your time, your thinking, or your hands. That's never not important. But I think P.ink gives us who are creatives, designers, writers, coders and others a chance to do what they love to do, in an inventive way, and to make life better for someone else. That's probably why we've had so much great help from the people at CP+B in bringing this to life. JB: Over the summer, you launched Inkspiration, an app women survivors can download onto their smart phones. How does the app work? NF: We created the app to address the single biggest question for someone considering a mastectomy tattoo: what will this look like on me? When you download and use the app, you'll have a very specific answer. To use it, simply open it up; choose from a variety of body types or take a picture of your own chest; and then select a tattoo from our gallery. And you'll see what it looks like on you. And perhaps that encourages you to get a little more creative, tap the ""find an artist"" button, reach out to a nearby artist who can help, and the two of you can make some real magic.   JB: What are your biggest needs in moving forward with P.ink? NF: Thank you for asking. Just like any growing enterprise, our two biggest needs are talent and money.  First, talent: If more people knew the role that tattoo artists play in the healing process, we wouldn't need to exist. What if these skilled artists--the really great ones--were as findable as the really great doctors in our lives? They're not, and we need to change it, and our small team of volunteers needs help finding them. So I encourage people to dig, find those great artists who do have mastectomy experience and let us know. We'll feature them in our directory. Contact us with your gems: help@p-ink.org. Second, money: P.ink Day is great. But that's only once a year, and there's a huge unmet need the other 364 days of the year. And while our hope is that people find us online, find what they're looking for and then hire an artist, there are still many survivors who don't want to take this step without some help. So we've started the P.ink Fund; we're working with a small, elite team of artists around the U.S. and Canada whom we implicitly trust, and we're seeking donations to pay those artists for their best work. To date more than 350 survivors have asked to be beneficiaries of either the P.ink Fund or P.ink Day. When there's money in the bank we tackle that list on a first-come, first-served basis. But there's a lot more demand than there is supply. So we encourage donations online: http://p-ink.org/give. And for survivors wishing to sign up as a potential beneficiary, visit: http://p-ink.org/signup. JB: Where can our readers learn more about P.ink? NF: We're at p-ink.org. Our always-growing collections of P.ink Day images, tattoo ideas and artists with mastectomy experience are at Pinterest: http://pinterest.com/personalink. And we also have a robust community of survivors at https://www.facebook.com/personalink. For those looking to get more involved, email us at help@p-ink.org. Donate here: http://p-ink.org/give.

"This is a very lightly edited transcript from a December meeting between New York Times editorial page editor James Bennet and a number of Times employees. For more, read our story about the meeting. James Bennet: So the op-ed page was created to do a bunch of different things. But it was partly because this other paper was going out of business, and the feeling — in this very New York-centric moment, The New York Times obviously was an entirely print-centric world — was, there’s nobody to keep us honest anymore. You know, we’ll take our positions and there’s nobody arguing the other side. And so the Times very deliberately went out to create a space in our own universe where there would be people taking the other side and where we would, again, be able to cover — and you can see this in the initial statement for the op-ed page — we engage with the culture, engage with a wide range of subjects. And that’s remained the goal of the page and the ecology of the opinion report over time. But what you’ve seen is the kind of regression to the mean, I think, that takes place. And in many ways we became more and more homogenous as the years went by. I mean, all the work was excellent. But I think a degree of sameness set in and to the point where it now — to grievously overstate the case, the idea of debate is, you have one guy for the Brookings Institution and one guy from the Council of Foreign Relations arguing in the page.  And we’ve conducted a number of — there have been a number of really important innovations in recent years, and I point to Op-Docs as really a central one. We can talk about that if you guys are interested. But in a lot of ways the world of opinion journalism has been, as you all know, undergoing a revolution over the course of the last 10 or 15 years. The Times hasn’t fully participated in it. So, what we’re trying to do now, and the sort of project we’re engaged in, is essentially to try — you can think of it as trying to diversify ourselves in four dimensions at the same time, or along four axes. The first is our team itself. So again, the columnists are the most visible representation of this. Each of them are excellent in their own ways and are fantastic as an array. They don’t necessarily represent our aspirations for our audience, let alone our ambition to capture the full range of — one can never capture the full range — but a wider range of the debate that’s out there. This is true of the department as a whole, and we are working towards diversifying our team.  We’re trying to diversify the ways we tell stories, and that’s about breaking out of the boxes that really still constrain us in the print paper, and the notion that what we do is editorials of 500 words and columns of 800 words and op-eds of maybe 900 words. It’s hard to overstate the degree to which that framework constrains us still ― although we’re beginning to push past it and think about other ways of opinionizing against the news. Longer, more deeply reported pieces, incorporating or leading with graphics and visual forms of opinion. And we’ve created a small video unit that’s doing, now, opinion journalism for us, led by Adam Ellick. So that’s story form, second category. Third category is subject matter — another way that we’ve kind of regressed to a mean, I think. Our default game in opinion is politics and global affairs. And that tends to dominate what we do. We’re going to be putting a much more deliberate focus on subject area and kind of diversifying our range of opinion to more deliberately engage with the world of technology, business and economics, and the culture. We can talk more about that if you want. And then the last component for it is ideological range, where I think both on the editorial line and our columnists and a lot of our op-eds were conducting a debate that was often between the 40-yard lines. And this was evident in the last campaign, where — the last presidential campaign, now I am talking about politics again — where, you know, there wasn’t really an advocate for the Bernie Sanders view of the world formally in our pages. And we’ve had fewer voices to the right for quite some time. Now, of all of this work, it’s that last thing I mentioned that’s getting the most attention and the most concern, and the most blowback. But what I’m trying to explain is, it is one element in everything we’re trying to do.  We’ve gotten a couple more — and I’m very grateful for — some investment in the company for a few more slots that’s helping us do this work. But it’s a fairly ambitious reset of the entire operation largely within our existing footprint, and it’s really hard on our people. I mean, you’re going through a lot of turbulence right now. And Tyson can testify to that. I think on the other side of that is a lot of excitement and fun and a real adventure as we kind of get people sorted and get a clear understanding of everything we’re up to, what the ambitions are, and can begin experimenting in a big way. But right now we’re in the thick of it. Sorry, I talked a lot longer than I meant to. That’s the overall — did I leave anything out?  NYT employee: Can I ask you a question? Can you talk about some of the things that you’re really most proud of, or some of the biggest things you feel like you’ve been able to do since you’ve been here? Even if maybe they’re the most challenging at the same time. Bennet: I wouldn’t say there’s anything I’m particularly proud of. I’m really grateful for the way that my colleagues have kind of risen to the occasion here. I mean, again, it’s been hard, because everybody’s job is changing, and our people just all lost their offices. I mean, talk about a first-class problem, but it is a problem. If you’re a columnist at The New York Times, part of what goes with that is you have an office. And one day, you get it taken away — and editorial board members, too. We still have members of the editorial board who lament the offices that we had on 43rd Street, which were sort of, I don’t know, baronial — fires in the [inaudible] and dogs on the floor, and somebody — anyway. I think there’s some work we’ve been doing lately, there’s been some pieces — our graphics team is super strong. It’s two people, basically, right now. But I can point you to some examples of specific pieces, like the big piece about the opening up of this last Alaskan wilderness that we were able to do in a really — we just didn’t have the ability to tell a story that way just a few months ago. And it was really dynamic and powerful. And we’re doing more of that kind of work more regularly. I’m super happy with the work that Michelle Goldberg is doing. She’s a columnist for us, and Lindy West, who’s another new — she’s a weekly voice that we’ve added. And when I imagine a counterfactual, which is, again, I don’t know if you guys have had time to read any of this stuff, I know we’re all super busy. But we’ve got a bunch more very strong — going through this Harvey Weinstein moment without them, we would have done some really good work, but when I try to imagine what that would have been like, it feels like our report would have been really impoverished. So in a way, both these things are sort of proof of concept to me of how much more exciting it’s going to be when we represent a wider range. I feel the same way about Bret’s work for us. I know that there was a lot of — and I experienced it — a lot of criticism and concern about him. And you guys may disagree or there may be people who do, but I just think he’s an exceptional writer and thinker. I don’t agree with him a lot of the time. But I like to read him, so. And one thing that’s hard here, by the way, is that among the things we’re asking of people is — and I’ve had this experience before elsewhere — is, it’s a really hard thing to ask people who disagree with each other to work with each other. You know? And particularly with opinion journalism, these are people who are paid to have very, very strong convictions, and to believe that they’re right.  And then you want to put them together and say, “OK now we want to treat each other civilly and be good colleagues.” And that can be a difficult thing. But again, people are, I think — and, Tyson, correct me if I’m wrong — they’re making it work. We’ve had some explosions, but culturally it’s real, it’s actually a challenge internally. And if you ask me what I’m proud of, I’m proud of the way people have — I was not proud of some of the moments along the way. But in general, I think people handled that with the grace and dignity we would expect from people at The New York Times. NYT employee: I’m keeping an eye on Slack in case there are questions, but I guess what I’ll ask you is that — so you alluded earlier to a lot of, sort of, sameness, you know, among the opinions, like, across the board in media previously. How do you feel like the Times is currently — in your opinion section, that you’re running — how is it differentiating itself from, say, other publications? Bennet: This is where we’re trying to get. If you, um... I think, in general, what we’ve seen is that there are not very many places that have the ambition of putting people with very different points of view into conversation with each other. That may be because it’s a bad idea. I think it’s also because it’s hard to do that. And other publications simply don’t have the same sense of purpose around this that The New York Times has. Particularly the digital upstarts that have come along. The startups, generally, and serious players over the course of the last 15 or 20 years tend to have a point of view on the world and drive that point of view through everything that they’re doing. In the print world, it’s the approach that The Economist has taken, and arguably, it’s kind of what The New Yorker is, in the print world. And if you imagine two axes — and this is Tyson’s visual representation of this — where you put digital and print on two of the extremes and a single point of view and many voices on the other, and you sort publications that way, what you find is that one quadrant is almost entirely empty, which is digital and lots of points of view. One exception to that is media, which is open to everybody and obviously not a curated space. When we think about the competitive landscape, if there’s one publication I would say is maybe ahead of us here is The Washington Post, which scares me, and they’re moving into that space. And there’s a lot of risk here for us. I mean, this is where we need to go to be consistent with — and I think there’s an intuition and a faith that we’re not reaching a lot of readers who might otherwise appreciate Times journalism, partly because they feel like they don’t recognize themselves in our opinion report. That said, we could piss a lot of people off, you know, doing this work. And we don’t have very good measures of the risk or the reward. But I mean, I’m sorry, again, I’m talking way too much. I guess, to sort of answer your question, it feels like a very — the reason we’re driving towards this position is, it is both true to what... it’s authentic. It’s what we’re supposed to do. The third reason actually is true. It’s true to who we’re supposed to be. And it feels very differentiated. Nobody else is doing it.  The third reason I would say is, I just think it — the world needs this from us right now. You know it is, it is cutting against, and I don’t mean to sound pious, but it really is true that this is a crude and dangerously polarized time. And this is where it’s journalistically true to the ambitions of the Times, to approach opinion in this way. The notion that anybody has a monopoly on what the right answers are is just a dangerous kind of form of hubris that too many of us are really falling prey to right now. And you look what’s happening in the world, the sort of crackup of ideologies, of political parties. Neither party really makes sense, I don’t think, right now, in the U.S., ideologically, and there are big questions about trade, for example, that have been reopened. And to simply assert that we know what the right answers are is not good for the democracy. So I think trying to show that it’s possible, both to have strong convictions and an open mind to other people’s egos, is a valuable contribution that we can make. NYT employee: So there are questions in Slack, but I don’t want to monopolize. So it’s kind of variations on the same question, so I’m just going to pick one. So, media literacy is a big problem. We see and understand the differences between the op-ed and editorial, but how do you communicate to readers and critics, and keep from sending mixed signals to the world? Bennet: I think we do a really bad job of this right now. I think, a) I think those categories — these are the sorts of categories that make sense to us and don’t make any sense to other people. Like, what is an op-ed? I’d kind of like to stop using that word, even internally, but we’re stuck with it. What is an editorial? We have been talking too long now, even in the time I’ve been here, about doing a better job of communicating this to readers. And we’re still not actually doing it very well. Partly, it requires product solutions that have so far eluded our grasp. But I think every piece that goes out to us needs to be very clearly labeled. Not just labeled “opinion,” which right there we have a problem, particularly in social. But we’ve gotten a little better there. But then, it needs to carry a description of what it is. That’s particularly true of editorials, but also other pieces of opinion. And right now, if you, I mean, you know, more than 80 percent of our readers encounter one piece of opinion from The New York Times a month, and that is their only exposure to Times opinion. And if that is a piece by Charles Blow or a piece by Bret Stephens or a piece by Erik Prince, you will form your opinion of who we are based on that one encounter with that one ambassador of our content. And this is... I mean, everybody has this problem: Somehow we have to do a better job at the atomic level of the individual piece of communicating a version of what it just took me 15 minutes to explain to you guys. So I’d welcome any suggestions on how to do that. One of the areas — I mean, small thing, but where I envy the Post right now — and I don’t know how good or effective it is — but they’ve built a little bit of [artificial intelligence] into their... and I don’t know what level. But they are now able to automate serving up not just one argument, but the counterargument with it. So the related links are right there. Whether anybody uses those links or not, it’s a nice statement about the brand and the ambition ― that we’re giving you this point of view, and here’s somebody who disagrees with it in one package, should you choose to go there. That’s the kind of thing, you know, we should be doing, I think. NYT employee: One of the questions on here is around the advocacy that you described. Can you talk a little bit about that? Bennet: This was related to the tax bill, which we’ve been editorializing against. And the voice of the editorial board went onto Twitter to do direct advocacy on it, urging holdout senators who agreed with a number of the positions that we’ve taken on what it would do to the deficit, and how it was shifting the burden of taxation, and the specific issues it didn’t deal with. They each had a different specific issue to stand their ground. It was the kind of experiment that I’ve been encouraging our people to do. And I’m still not sure we’ve learned from it. It had — and, Tyson, you weigh in here, you have a better sense. It had, it had a very big impact. It got a lot of people talking. It pissed off our colleagues in the Washington bureau hugely, because it felt to everybody like a more direct form of advocacy than we traditionally do. In reality, I’ve yet to — and maybe one of you can do this — I’ve yet to get the explanation for why that’s the case. The principled explanation for why this was more direct. Like, we editorialized for this specific election in defeat of a given candidate. We editorialize and say “You should go throw this bum out of office.” That, to me, is as direct a form of advocacy as we could possibly do. Saying “Go call the senator and urge them to stick to their principles” feels like a much less direct form of advocacy. Yet it didn’t... I mean, I can argue logically that it’s a much — I think I’m right. But it felt — and I think it felt that way because it’s just different than anything we’ve done before. It was therefore shocking people and upsetting. But I’m still scratching around to try to figure out where the violation of principle is here.  Tyson Evans, senior editor, opinion products and strategy: I think that was key. Part of the problem in evaluating it is we don’t really have anything to compare it to, because we haven’t done anything similar, so it’s hard to know what size of impact it was supposed to have. I think in the spirit of this moment where we’re trying to say, the form of an editorial is so purely a print construct over the last century, that we’re asking, who are these editorials for? And what action are we trying cause by writing them? And what’s the value of the institution taking a position on something in a moment where it’s just a lot easier for this industry to do something when they feel compelled to do it. When they read a well-written, persuasive argument. Those are the facts on the ground and I think we’re still wrestling with what to do with it, and what’s the capital we have, how many times a year. The Guardian kind of plowed the way forward with this a couple years ago with their “Keep it in the ground” campaign, which was very, very driven over the course of one or two years, I think. [inaudible] It was a really concentrated effort of advocacy and trying to mobilize the citizenship to divest and persuade their legislative groups. So I don’t know, I think we’re early, and we’d love input on what’s the right way to do it, what are the right moments. Bennet: There are definitely some tactical things that we would do differently if we do this again. And we were able to have an impact. I mean, we did jam the switchboards on Capitol Hill, which is a more tangible outcome than we often get when we editorialize, so. And then we got some pushback from some readers, and some from our colleagues. And from individual senators, who were really pissed. [Sen.] Susan Collins [R-Maine] was just — but, you know. NYT employee: I mean, maybe to build on this point ― you started by talking about creating a place for civil debate. There is something about this that says, “But we’re also going to go and take some proactive actions beyond civil debate and push one side of the agenda.” And how do you think about the editorial page within that debate?  Bennet: Well, part of the goal of having more debate is, again, the, you know, basically making the editorial line a little more relevant in some ways. Because if we’re all agreeing with each other, what’s the point of having editorials? I think the first-order question is, what’s the point of having editorials? And here’s what I think, is that it saves us from more of the real moral hazards in the opinion environment in which we want to say, we want to convene lots of voices from lots of points of view. I would worry and personally be concerned about saying we’re indifferent to what the right answer is, right? We don’t just want to let a thousand flowers bloom, let a thousand schools of thought contend, and we’ll just provide the platform. In which there is one version of this, in which [inaudible], I think the conversation will continue about whether that’s actually the right outcome. What the editorials allow us to do, is to say on matters of real consequence, where for one reason or another, this institution has felt a kind of historic connection, the Times is going to come down. And God knows, we argued against women’s suffrage on the editorial page of The New York Times, so we should be humble every time we write one of these about whether we’re actually right. But on big questions, you know, climate change — I think this tax bill actually qualifies. I didn’t mention this, but one of the things we’re trying to do is — and we have done, actually — is lower the key. You know, the last — since time immemorial now, it’s three editorials a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. We’re reducing the cadence, so there are fewer of them. And then this is something David has pressed me for for a long time, is, so what are the issues that The New York Times should be engaging with? [Note to readers: We’re not sure who “David” is.] I mean, I think there’s... the three fundamental, you know, values that guide the editorial on is — and I’m still wrestling with all of these questions, and I’ve not done a good enough job of distilling any of this — but we’re concerned about honesty, fairness and progress. Right? And those things can actually be thought of as usefully in tension with each other. For example, take particularly progress and fairness. I mean, I think we are pro-capitalism. The New York Times is in favor of capitalism because it has been the greatest engine of, it’s been the greatest anti-poverty program and engine of progress that we’ve seen. But The New York Times is very concerned with fairness. We’ve been concerned with the essential equality of human beings from the get-go, and with minority rights and individual rights from the get-go. And in thinking about, for example, the tax bill in this and that, you know, we actually like the idea of reducing corporate rates. We’re not for taxation for purposes of taxation, but we are very concerned about fairness and equitable distribution. And it’s sort of wrestling with the, with the tensions there is, I think, how we come out where we do. But, you know, there’s a hierarchy of specific concerns. Honesty speaks to, again, to my mind, it speaks to the free exercise of a sound conscience and our preoccupation with First Amendment rights, and the ability for people to always be able to speak their minds and advocate positions that they believe in. That’s kind of at the top of our hierarchy of concerns. NYT employee: Just reading off the Slack channel, I’m going to abstract it out a little, but when you have differing opinions, how do you first of all vet and make sure that facts are right? But maybe even going a step further, how do you make sure that people aren’t misrepresenting facts? Maybe if you could even tie that into how you even think about the voices you invite in, to kind of judge whether they’re really going to take a fair take on [inaudible]. Bennet: You know we do, I mean at a very basic level, we fact-check our work. So, there is a kind of layer there of having a — but the harder question is representation of fact. And that’s where we’re really, you know, are instilling rules of the road and kind of values for how we approach argumentation and hiring for people. And you know, the first-order value is intellectual honesty. And that means — and God knows we don’t succeed at this every day — but the goal is, you’re supposed to take on the hard arguments on the other side, not the easy arguments. Not the straw men, but the actual substantive, kind of toughest arguments and acknowledge when the other side has a point. No ad hominem attacks. There’s a sort of series of things that we expect of our people and we’re hiring, to my mind — the two columnists who have been brought on board since I’ve been here have been Bret and Michelle so far, and both of them totally clear the bar, in my view, of being people who have both conviction — strong points of view — and very open minds. I give our conservatives, in general, particular credit because they have to live this every day in a way liberals don’t, because they’re working in an environment where they are constantly having to grapple [with] people with very, very different points of view. It really is in the hiring, of picking people that have these different [inaudible]. But the seduction of straw-man arguing is quite powerful and something. And it’s a danger on the editorial side, too, that we face a lot. Particularly when you’re operating within an echo chamber. NYT employee: So, kind of building on that, there’s sort of a question related, which is, like, in a world where a lot of people are sort of interested [in] reading the thing that they agree with, how do you balance the desire to have opposing viewpoints versus, you know, people gravitating to certain kinds of coverage? So yeah, just, how do you think about that? Bennet: I’m really concerned about this for opinion journalism generally, because right now in the last couple of years, with your — particularly now, though, the rewards for saying the same thing over and over again, and providing that kind of affirmation, are huge. And the punishments for stepping out of line and saying something — I’m talking about the individual writer, now — saying, hey, actually you know, the Democrats have a point about X or the Republicans have a point about Y, depending on their point of view, you just get killed for that in social media.  Then the effect of this, and I think you can see it happening, is that writers are becoming less interesting. You know, I can say this particularly as someone who is looking forward to new opinion writers. And you want supple minds and people who are a little bit unpredictable, and you’re not reading the same piece over and over again. It’s getting harder to find people like that. And it is partly a function of the media environment. We need super-strong, tough people, for one thing, to weather that environment and stay true to the ambitions that we have for the work we want done. NYT employee: I’m going to read, specifically, just cause I want your reaction to it, which is, how do you have a civil debate when one side isn’t interested in being civil or factual? Bennet: I think there are a lot of people out there, on both sides actually, who aren’t that interested in — and I’ll be accused of both-siderism, I’m only saying that because I’ve experienced it — who aren’t particularly interested in being civil or factual. And that’s true. And I actually understand that feeling myself some days, when I don’t feel like I want to be terribly civil or factual because I’m so angry about it. Um, read the question again, it was —  NYT employee: Let me ask it this way. [inaudible] How do you think about, like, is there one side that isn’t — this specific thing is, one side isn’t interested in being civil or factual, and how do you think about that? Or not. Bennet: I think that that’s true, and I lament it. I just don’t want to give into that ourselves. And I also think there are a lot of people out there who are susceptible to feeling that way, who aren’t necessarily going to feel that way if they are presented with an alternative. And this is where I think if — it’s not like we’re going to win all those people over and bring them onto our platform necessarily. But I do think if we show that we take — let’s talk about it from the point of view of the left and think about conservatives. Most of our readers [inaudible] are liberal. I think if we show we take conservatives seriously and we take ideas seriously there, we get a lot more moderates paying attention to what The New York Times has to say. I think we lose the moderates completely if we just show that we think the conservatives are just, that there’s no point in even engaging their ideas or to debate with them. That’s not the same thing as saying, you know, I don’t think we’re going to reform everybody in the world.  NYT employee: It’s a follow-up to something kind of earlier. You identified that you’re having trouble finding new voices, and that a lot of the problems you’ve identified seem to be that we just don’t have people representing certain positions. During the election you had no strong advocate for [Sen.] Bernie Sanders [I-Vt.], or any of those positions. And so I guess, in the more recent months, in your attempts to find those voices, where have you been looking, what types of people have you been looking for, and how are you trying to get a more diverse group of people regularly writing in the op-ed section? Bennet: I think we need, and you know, I’m sorry if I’m going to talk in code a little bit here, but I’m not talking about ideology necessarily. I’m talking about identity, as well. What columnists do, you know,p again, highly intellectually honest, highly entertaining, highly interesting writers who have a lot to say — hard to find those people from the get-go. What a columnist is is a trusted voice in your ear that helps you process, kind of, the world in real time, right? Through a particular lens. And there are a number of lenses we’re missing right now, I think. And a lot of those are, it’s gender and it’s identity, you know, as well as ideology. So where am I looking? I’m asking, I’m asking you guys. You know, send me names, please. You know, if there are people that you’re reading that you think belong in The New York Times. You know, please. I always, when I was at The Atlantic, I always kept a list of Atlantic writers who didn’t work for The Atlantic, just who felt like — I was at The Atlantic magazine before I came back to the Times, and there was a particular kind of, not that dissimilar from the kind of people we’re looking for now, with voice. And I could see them on other platforms and they just didn’t know that they were Atlantic people yet, but they were. And I don’t have as good a list now as I did then. It might be my own failing. Earlier I blamed the environment for that. But I’m taking nominations.   I’ve been... if I could, this is what I would be spending 90 percent of my time on. Because hiring in general, and I’m sure you guys feel this, too, is the most important thing that we do. Like, that’s the most important editing we do, is picking the people. After that, you know, you ideally cut them loose to do their thing. In reality, I’m spending a small percentage of my time on this. So I would love help. So please send your nominations my way. NYT employee: So question for you. Do you consider women’s rights, trans rights, people of color’s rights, to be liberal stances? Bennet: Um, I consider them to be classically liberal stances, as I understand liberalism classically. Which is to say, very concerned with the rights of the individual. The sort of John Stuart Mill sense of the world. You know, in a sort of American modern ideological framework, I would say they are also understood to be liberal. But I guess that’s not necessarily the way I would — I mean, these are human rights and deeply connected, I think, to our understanding of human value, which, again, I think is core to the editorial convictions of The New York Times. The essential equality of human beings. NYT employee: Maybe, can I just do a follow-up on that one? How would you think about, like, when you think about encouraging open debate, something like trans rights versus climate change where, you know — are there certain things where you said, like, there’s really not a debate? Bennet: Oh yeah, there are certain things I would think of as settled law. And I think the fact of climate change is one of them. That is the science of climate change, that it’s happening and that humans are driving it. What to do about it, how to address it, I think that’s a big debate that, in general, we should be participating in more actively than we are, right? Yeah, there are issues like, “Nazism: good or bad?” is not a debate I imagine The New York Times necessarily convening. It’s just, like, I think there are issues that are settled law. Although, apparently now slavery is an issue again in the Alabama Senate race, as of today. There’s people making a case for that. Well, [Roy] Moore was asked — I only saw it — I guess he was asked when the last time America was great was, and that was when it was great.  NYT employee: So just to follow up on this, there was a thread in Slack on this. You know, with climate change, can people have opinions about it? You know, like with trans rights, can people have opinions about it? Or is The New York Times’ perspective, “No no no, the debate that we want to encourage is not whether there should be trans rights or whether there is climate change but the implications for society about it.” Or how do you think about it? Bennet: I think we should have discussions about what the implications are for society. I’m not sure I understand the question exactly. NYT employee: The question is — we’re talking about the debate, what matters are settled that shouldn’t even be debated, versus what the debate actually is. I think, you know, climate change is a good example. So they said that you have a voice in the opinion pages who maybe has a different perspective about what to do with climate change. You’d say, “It’s not that Bret Stephens opposes or doesn’t think climate change is happening,” right? Or is he representing that other perspective? How do you think about where the debate begins versus the debate having been settled? Bennet: We — let me answer this generically first, and then come back specifically to Bret and climate change. We have, this is, this is the hard and interesting debate we have all the time, which is, what are the boundaries for debate in Times opinion. There are no hard and fast rules here. And it’s our privilege and burden as editors to define those boundaries, and we will get it wrong, right? There will be times we’ll publish a piece that feels, “Wow, that’s really a little bit out of bounds.” I would expect that to happen sometimes. I’d be much [more] worried about the environment in which we never crossed that boundary than one in which every now and then we do. So, that’s going to happen, I think. And that said, we have faced this over and over again. For example, we published a piece — well, I just gave away the punchline — but we had a big argument over a piece by a settler. And you know, pick your issue. For some people it’s climate change, for some people it’s trans rights, for others it’s a two-state solution and the fate of the Palestinians. In this case, it was the settler saying, look, the two-state solution is dead and [it’s] time to face reality, and here’s some alternative paths for what the future would look like. And we had a real debate about whether this piece was crossing a line, because was it denying personhood to the Palestinians? Was it an act of, kind of, hate speech in a sense? I felt strongly that we should publish the piece and we did, as did others. Because this particular viewpoint is hugely consequential. It actually is creating reality on the ground. To pretend that somehow we would be — either to think that we were legitimating that point of view by having it in our pages or to tell ourselves that we were somehow changing the reality by not allowing it into our pages seems to me to be deluded a little bit. And our readers need to hear it, like, unmediated, I think. They need to confront these arguments. And we published that piece, and we faced that.  We talk a lot about the Richard Spencer test, you know: Would we publish Richard Spencer in the pages of The New York Times? The answer to that is no — oh, well, the piece we’d publish from him is “Why I Got Everything Wrong, by Richard Spencer,” if he was owning up to it. I mean, as you could imagine, there’s conditions. But the reasons we wouldn’t right now are largely because the guy is — he represents a particularly poisonous point of view. And that isn’t having those kinds of consequences. You know, it’s not a, it’s not a giant movement. We’ve published [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, you know, and should we not allow Vladimir Putin into our pages? It’s hard to say. It’s hard to say that that would be doing a service to our readers. But as you can see, I mean, I struggle to articulate what those boundaries are. It’s one of the hard things. You guys have to eventually render judgment, you know. And there’s a degree of subjectivity inevitably that creeps into all of these sorts of decisions, and it’s particularly true in the opinion environment. I do — and I mean, it is a real struggle, and I do want to emphasize the thought that I worry a lot more about how, again, over time, you play it safe, you play it safe, you play it safe, and you wind up where, I think, we were. And I think you become a lot less interesting and a lot less of a constructive source of force in this society if you are not willing to take some chances.  NYT employee: So [inaudible] if you publish one thing in this one perspective, how do you think about providing the balance or making sure that when you’re putting something out there — do you think about that? Or ... Bennet: Um, I do. I don’t think we do a great job of that, as much as, you know, we want to have this kind of cacophonous opinion report with a lot of different points of view represented. I think it’s hard to do it and have it be compellingly journalistic. If it’s kind of over-engineered, that is, we’ll only publish this point of view when we have a point of view on the other side. And we’ll present everything as a debate — well, actually there are four or five corners to this debate, and we’ve got to wait until we have all the pieces, and then we — people don’t consume journalism that way, and it doesn’t feel very vital. I think it needs to be a running debate, that we need to be more deliberate over time about representing all these points of view. And then again, it’s a product question, too, like once we have them all, we need to be able to present them as a kind of constellation. But even in the editorial piece of it, and this is part of what the reorganization of our team is about, we’re not doing — we’re getting better at that. And look, you guys, I mean, debates are — there are always many, many points of view. And you can’t — my view is that it’s just one side and the other side, but... more voices is going to help us with that. NYT employee: Do we have time for one more question? [inaudible] Bennet: What do you guys think we’re doing wrong? Or what would you change?  NYT employee: I think something that the staff would probably say is that, on the web, it can be difficult — and this is something that A.G. said when we did the Q&A with him — is that, on the web, it can be difficult to differentiate opinion pieces versus news pieces when they’re, like, right next to each other. That just generally, I think, continues to be a confusing point for a lot of people. Bennet: Yeah, yeah, I agree. We’re trying to make a bunch of changes, improve the labeling. We’re actually going to change — I mean these are, some of these are the sorts of cues we’ve used in the past that we tell ourselves matter but don’t really matter to the readers. I think we are going to wind up with a bolder kind of differentiated typographical treatment for our opinion pieces. But there are some basic things we should be doing, like when it’s an opinion piece, the bio of the writer should be at the top of the piece, so you know kind of some sense of who this is and what point of view they’re advocating. You know, that this is the president of Russia. You know, right now it can look like just a New York Times staff writer, and there are design and product solutions here that I hope we’re going to have in place in the first quarter next year. But honestly, I thought we’d have them in the first quarter of this year, so I can’t — um, things take a long time to work their way through the processes here. But I do agree. I worry about that a lot. I know I really don’t like our opinion work to be contaminated by the news side.",I,think,lenses
"Babies have an almost magical ability to melt the hearts of adults ― most adults, anyway. Earlier this year, scientists revealed that infants’ cuteness doesn’t end with just chubby cheeks, button noses and other visual features. It also includes how they sound and smell. It’s as if babies are designed to shower us in a positive sensory overload targeting all senses.  And this is no accident. Throughout evolution, babies (of humans and probably most other animals) developed ways to optimally attract the attention of adults, whom they need in order to survive. Research going back to the 1940s by renowned ethologist Konrad Lorenz, who looked at babies’ physical features and face — what he called the baby schema — suggests they are not funny or cute by chance, but that cuteness has some sort of evolutionary purpose by provoking a care reaction in adults.   But what happens when babies grow out of infancy, and their extremely cute faces morph into something less baby-like and more adult-like? This is a particularly important question for human kids who have a long childhood and a long period of dependency on adults. They have to develop another strategy to keep a firm grip on our hearts.  And, of course, they have. As their outside cuteness slowly fades, kids seem to use another skill to continue getting caring attention from parents: something that a group of scientists in Spain have dubbed cognitive babyness. “Preschoolers have something that seems as strong as the baby schema in infants. Something that makes children more appealing for adults,” said psychologist Carlos Hernandez Blasi of University Jaume I in Castellon, Spain. “What we find is that precisely in this period from 2 to 7 years old, which we call early childhood, these important cues for adults are not so physical in nature but cognitive.”  Kids at this age show a type of immature thinking that comes off as cute and funny, and provokes a positive emotion and caring reaction in adults, Blasi and his colleagues found in experiments.  One such immature thinking involves showing a bias to attribute lifelike and human motivations to inanimate things. For example, a child might say “the sun didn’t come out because he was mad.” This type of thinking is called animism. Another is finalism, or a bias to attribute specific purposes or “reasons for being this way” to events. For example, a kid might say that a mountain has a big peak and a small peak, because the big one is for long hikes and the small one is for short hikes. “We have labelled this group of cognitive traits as reflecting supernatural thinking, because what they share is an explanation of natural phenomena that involves some form of supernatural or magical causation,” Blasi and his colleagues wrote in a new paper in the British Journal of Psychology. Not all childlike thinking involves magical causation and supernatural elements. Overestimating one’s ability (to memorize a long list of 50 items, for example) is one of type of such natural immature thinking. To determine the effects of these various modes of thinking on adults, Blasi and his team presented college students with pairs of short vignettes. One depicted a child showing immature thinking (of either the natural or supernatural type) and a second depicted another child using the same type of mature thinking that adults show. The study participants had to rank the hypothetical children, who ranged in age from 3 to 9, on a dozen adjectives, including, cute, sneaky, smart and helpless. The researchers found that adults rated the children exhibiting immature supernatural thinking more positively and as more helpless than children expressing mature cognition. Sometimes the vignettes were accompanied by a child’s face, but the cognitive cues seemed to be more powerful than facial cues in evoking adults’ positive reactions. This suggest that for kids beyond infancy, cute behavior trumps a cute face when competing for parents’ caregiving responses.  “It was more important what the kids said than what they looked like,” Blasi said. In a series of similar experiments, Blasi and his colleagues have found similar effects for both men and women, parents and non-parents, and in two different countries, the United States and Spain. Another piece of evidence that supernatural thinking in young kids serves to boost parental attention is that a 12-year-old doesn’t find it cute. The positive reaction seems to emerge at some point after puberty.  “Older adolescents’ reaction is similar to adults,” Blasi said. “It seems that this reaction is not something you are born with but develops later on.”  What happens to babies and children who aren’t all that cute, physically or cognitively? Although these young humans may experience some discrimination early on, it doesn’t mean that they would be totally ignored. The babyness that provokes in adults an urge to protect comes in many forms, and a cuter face may just make the reaction come easier and faster.  And no one stays cute forever anyway. ",they,developed,order
"Hannah Kendall Shuman was trying to finish up homework for her college Criminal Justice 101 class earlier this month when she stumbled upon a familiar face: Brock Turner.  The freshman at Washington State University told HuffPost she was surprised to see the Stanford rapist’s face in her textbook “Introduction to Criminal Justice: Systems, Diversity, and Change 2nd Edition.” Turner, who served only three months for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman at Stanford in 2015, is featured under the definition of “rape” in the textbook, which was published in January 2017 by Callie Marie Rennison and Mary J. Dodge.  “A recent highly publicized example is that of rapist Brock Turner. Turner, a student at Stanford University, was caught in the act, and ultimately convicted of three felony charges: assault with intent to rape an intoxicated woman, sexually penetrating an intoxicated person with a foreign object, and sexually penetrating an unconscious person with a foreign object,” the textbook reads. “Turner’s victim was unconscious during the attack, as it happened behind a trash container outside of the Kappa Alpha fraternity house on campus.” (Flip to page 20 to read the page in full.) On Sept. 7, Shuman published a photo of the textbook page to Facebook, writing: “He may have been able to get out of prison time but in my Criminal Justice 101 textbook, Brock Turner is the definition of rape, so he’s got that goin for him.”  Underneath Turner’s image, the textbook gives some context about the former Stanford student’s controversial sentencing.  “Some are shocked at how short this sentence is,” the textbook reads. “Others who are more familiar with the way sexual violence has been handled in the criminal justice system are shocked that he was found guilty and served time at all. What do you think?” As of Wednesday morning, Shuman’s post has received over 40,000 likes, 91,000 shares and 3,500 comments. “I didn’t think anyone of status or wealth would ever want to bring him up again, it seemed like America just wanted to act as if he never happened,” Shuman told HuffPost. “I’m glad his name is resurfacing.” HuffPost has reached out to the textbook’s authors for comment and will update accordingly.",which,featured,Rennison

"What makes a show fail? Many in the industry have pondered that question. If we knew the answer, shows wouldn't fail. Even veteran producers with a string of hits sometimes stumble. For there is really no magic key. I thought Gigi and An American in Paris would do equally well during the start of previews, with Gigi perhaps having the edge as the more sentimental favorite. I was wrong. Despite a financially successful out-of-town mounting, Gigi never gathered a large advance and then came the reviews, which were not supportive. The community was not exactly welcoming to the show's first-time producer, Jenna Segal, or the casting of its Disney star lead, Vanessa Hudgens. I get that from people who saw the show. I don't get it from those that didn't. I didn't like High School Musical either, that is no reason to judge her performance in this show sight-unseen, but I'm moving on. I've already written about that topic. Looking back on it, even the haters have to give a begrudging, if muffled, hand to the two, who both clearly believed in their Gigi. Segal kept it alive for longer than most people would have advised, hoping package deals and more television appearances and social media contests would help the show catch on. In doing so, she kept employed many theater veterans, both on and off stage. Hudgens did more to sell a show than basically any star I've ever seen. I frequently joked that she did everything but offer to date ticket buyers. It was an incredible effort, and I'll forever be impressed by it. It didn't work to attract enough ticket buyers, but I think it showed an amazing commitment to the show. She also frequently spoke about other cast members in her appearances and showed up at Stars in the Alley just to introduce Corey Cott, so it wasn't all in a vain attempt at glory. (Yes, there are those that argue that the show being a bomb reflects badly on her, and it does indeed reflect on her ability to carry a show in terms of ticket sales. But I don't think these things were grabs for personal credibility. I choose to think they represent a true belief in the show and a representation of the real joy she felt being on Broadway. If it was something else, she has a bad team.)  During Stars in the Alley, she appeared onstage with Darren Criss. And I think they both represent something we need to come to terms with as an industry -- social media followings and excitement don't necessarily equate with ticket sales. Countless producers beg for those with large followings to tweet about their shows. Just last week, a producer said to me: ""Well, the advance isn't huge, but [celebrity name omitted] is coming and he's going to really promote it to his social media followers, so I'm not worried."" And, listen, that's great. Anytime you're getting the name of your show out there is a win, especially in this competitive, high-stakes environment. But let's all face the fact that Madonna tweeting once about your show is wonderful, it just isn't going to necessarily mean your show is a hit; it's probably not even going to help your Broadway show that much. Now this seems obvious. You may wonder why you're even reading this -- I swear to you though that this is an actual misconception.  Some Broadway shows reach out to churches. I'm not just talking about putting Michael Riedel in a van with church ladies from Virginia coming up to see The Color Purple. I'm talking Marva Hicks from Motown going to get the word out before previews. Amazing Grace is doing the same, sending cast members to sing at churches. There are those that argue that these old-school outreach attempts are a lot of effort for not much reward. After all -- if someone who had 5 million Twitter followers could sell only 1 percent of their followers, it would easily get more butts in seats than you could with one church visit, without as much effort. But that theory takes into a lot of ""ifs"" and also ignores the built-in ""word of mouth"" machine that is the church circuit. The #DarrenisHedwig Twitter campaign is massive. There is even a special @darrenlshedwig Twitter account, though it is not that commonly used. The night he started, I saw so many posts about his performance, or posts expressing sadness that the poster could not be there for his performance. If you checked Twitter for his name, you would think the Belasco would be sold out. He's also genuinely really good according to everyone I know who has seen him. However he's not selling tickets.

Likewise, Hudgens has an amazing following on social media. When I wrote a story supporting Gigi, two fans tracked down my email and sent me crazy messages. (That day I gained two fans in Argentina and lost the respect of at least six people in the industry who emailed to ask if I lost my mind.) She has 5.3 million followers on Twitter -- as a comparison, recent Tony winner Kelli O'Hara has 23,500. Criss and Hudgens have both tweeted a ton about their respective shows. Hudgens even does weekly short videos with the cast. There is of course no telling how much worse Gigi would be doing without Hudgens. She's clearly sold some tickets. (I sold tickets to people based on her -- à la I said: ""You know, I think your niece would love to see..."") With Criss on the other hand, we have a comparison, and he's not doing well. The show has been playing for a long time though, so arguably any comparison to past stars isn't 100% fair. But it can safely be said that neither of these performers have proved to be huge draws. Criss did very well ticket-wise in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying but that was during the height of Glee's popularity, was a very limited three-week engagement and How to Succeed was simply a more family friendly show. (Nick Jonas, Criss' How to Succeed replacement, had problems filling his large shoes.)  Both Hudgens and Criss have large international followings. I would honestly think, if it was still open, Gigi would have a slight uptick during the summer with tourists buying same day tickets. It seems like a show older teens could convince their parents to see. Hedwig, on the other hand, is obviously a tougher sell to families. The issue is that a huge chunk of their ""fans"" are sadly made up of people embarrassed that they once loved High School Musical and/or Glee or people not able to afford Broadway tickets or people honestly so used to seeing the stars for free, they don't think they should have to pay $150 to do it. (I've written frequently about the community pricing out young theatergoers, so I will not go into it here.) And neither has the magic juice needed to attract a broad base on name alone. They each need more to sell out a Broadway house. Gigi didn't get near money reviews, Criss didn't get reviewed.  I'm going to say this though -- I hear Criss is good. So go see him if you're on the fence. You have until July 19. As for Hudgens, if you're in town this week and want an enjoyable night at the theater, go see Gigi. You have four days left. I get the complaints about it, but if you don't go in with rigid ideas of what you want Gigi to be, you'll have a good time. The score sounds glorious and the production is lush. There are a lot of great performances on that stage -- Dee Hoty and 2015 Tony nominee Victoria Clark were for a while this season my favorite onstage duo. Hudgens really has an enthusiasm about her that I think is infectious. It's not genius theater, it's not making an artistic statement, it's not completely true to the Colette novella or as French as that or the movie, but it's a fun night. I was happy to see it was up $106,697 to $508,643 last week. At least that is a sign people liked the Tony Awards number or maybe even that they heard it was closing and wanted to catch it before it did. Listen, I'm not going to tell you that you'll regret it years from now if you miss it. I so rarely say that though, I doubt that should be the standard for anything. I am going to tell you, when my mother heard it was closing she said: ""Is there enough time to go again?"" She paid a shiva call yesterday and Gigi came up (don't ask me) and another family there said: ""We had so much fun! I couldn't believe it was closing!"" Obviously the word-of-mouth in the crowded spring season never rose to ""go right now,"" but that doesn't mean if you have time you shouldn't check it out.",I,talking,previews
"Hoda Kotb might be raking in the ratings on “Today,” but she tells People magazine she won’t be making the same salary as the man she’s replacing. NBC announced on Tuesday that Kotb would be replacing Matt Lauer as the co-anchor of the “Today” show after Lauer was accused of sexual misconduct in the workplace. Kotb will join Savannah Guthrie to lead the first two hours of the program, making history as the first female co-anchors for that segment.  Kotb told People on Wednesday that neither she nor Guthrie are making the same kind of money Lauer was.  “I think the whole money thing for me, I’ve always been sort of — I know it sounds ridiculous that I’m going to say this, but I really have done jobs I liked for the job I liked because I never wanted to be happy every other Friday on pay day,” Kotb told People. “Like, I didn’t want that to be the happy day. I wanted to feel good throughout. So no, I’m not making Matt Lauer money. Not even close.” Kotb did not mention what her contracted salary is, but Page Six reports that she and Guthrie are each making $7 million annually. Lauer ended his 25-year career at the network with a $25 million contract. And Megyn Kelly, who signed on to anchor the morning show’s third hour last year after great success at Fox News, makes about $18 million a year, according to a Variety estimate. NBC and a representative for Kotb did not return HuffPost’s requests for comment. “Today” ratings soared to beat rival “Good Morning America” after Kotb joined Guthrie in December. In an internal email announcing Kotb’s co-anchor role Tuesday, NBC News Chairman Andy Lack said Kotb and Guthrie have an “undeniable connection with each other and most importantly, with viewers.”  Kotb will also continue to co-host the show’s fourth-hour slot with Kathie Lee Gifford.",Kotb,said,viewers
"Busy Philipps said she’s “lucky that TMZ and the internet did not exist” when she and “Dawson’s Creek” co-star Michelle Williams hit the bar scene in Wilmington, North Carolina, in the early 2000s. “I feel very lucky that TMZ and the internet did not exist,” the actress said on Thursday’s “The Late Late Show With James Corden.”  “I would probably not be sitting here today. I would have been TMZ’d out of Hollywood,” she added. Philipps played Audrey starting in 2001 on the much-loved TV series and cultivated a lifelong friendship with Williams, who played Jen. The two frequently are seen out and about together and have been each other’s dates to award shows.  A post shared by Busy Philipps (@busyphilipps) on Apr 18, 2018 at 12:37am PDT Philipps told Corden about her and Williams’ “wild” nights in North Carolina while filming “Dawson’s Creek.” Philipps revealed that she would even have gotten into a bar fight for Williams, if necessary. “Michelle and I were at a bar one night, and this girl kinda was a little drunk and accused Michelle of being really rude to her on a flight,” Philipps said. “Michelle Williams is my best friend for many, many years,” the actress said. “She has never been rude to anyone ever. She is the sweetest, kindest, most loving human. If it had been me she’d accused, I would have been like, ‘That kinda tracks,’ but she accused Michelle of being rude, and I was just like, ‘I will not stand for this.’” To show she meant business, Philipps chose that time to reveal her hidden nose ring. “I had my nose pierced, you know in the middle, like a bull, at the time, in my early 20s, which people didn’t know,” Philipps said. “And I would hide it when I was doing my acting jobs. And so I flipped my nose ring down and was like … ‘Should we take this outside?’”  Philipps has long been perceived as the ultimate best friend ― consider the “Busy Philipps Is Your Best Friend” meme. A story published this month by The Cut described her like this: “You probably know Busy Philipps as somebody’s friend. ... With the easy laugh of your favorite sister and a poreless face made for ultra-high-definition 4K TV, she has played ‘best friend’ as dependably as anyone in Hollywood for the last 20 years.” To that, Philipps told The Daily Beast, “Everybody says that…” But clearly for good reason.

"A Florida woman made a very memorable impression at a wedding on Saturday, but not in a good way. Shelby McDowell, 20, was arrested by Flagler County Sheriff’s deputies after she crashed a wedding in order to spy on a guest she said was her boyfriend. He, however, told police he’s actually her ex-boyfriend. It was unclear whether he meant she was his ex prior to the wedding, or because of what happened at the wedding, Flagler Live reports. It all started Saturday morning when Darby Johns ― the man she claims was her beau ― told her he was going to a wedding at a nearby resort, but without her. Investigators said McDowell decided to go uninvited to spy on the 26-year-old Johns, who may or may not have been her boyfriend. After crashing the gathering, McDowell allegedly poured a drink on him and the woman he was dancing with before punching the woman in the face, according to WKMG TV. McDowell told WJAX TV that she wore a black wig to avoid being recognized. “I just wanted to find out what was going on, unnoticed, and leave,” she said in a written statement. “My intention was to SEE what was happening, and if I saw him betraying me, it would have been a way for me to know and understand that our relationship was over.” McDowell said when she walked into the ballroom, Johns was dancing and kissing another woman, identified as 26-year-old Crystal Munoz. That was when she chucked the drink and allegedly punched the woman in the left eye. Police said McDowell ran to the restroom and hid in a stall. McDowell claimed several women in the bridal party went into the bathroom and “pulled her out of the stall by her feet and they began to punch her,” according to the arrest report. However, resort employees told police that when the manager came to break up the fight, McDowell was on top Munoz, pummeling her, according to WKMG TV. McDowell was separated from her victim and made to wait until police and emergency responders arrived. “I was told that if I did not press charges on anyone, no charges would be pressed on me,” she told WJAX TV. “I agreed that I would not press charges, and I waited to be escorted out. When the police arrived, I was arrested and told that Crystal Munoz was pressing battery charges on me.” Officers charged McDowell with misdemeanor battery. She spent the night in jail before being released 12 hours later. In her statement to WJAX TV, McDowell acknowledged she is aware of certain social niceties. “I am aware that going to a wedding uninvited is wrong. I am aware that pouring a drink on someone is also wrong,” she said. She added: “I just wanted to see if Darby was really cheating, so that I could know it was forever over between us. It was always about him, never Crystal. I never intended for there to be a scene. “After the drink incident, if the girls had not of attacked me, there would never have been such a chaotic scene. I am very apologetic towards the bride and groom, since this happened at their wedding. “Like I said, I never intended for it to have gotten so out of control.” Johns told deputies that he did not kiss Munoz, but instead that he and Munoz were walking to the dance floor when McDowell allegedly attacked them",she,told,TV
"Indian families’ traditional preference for sons over daughters has led to the existence of millions of “unwanted” girls in the country, a new government report estimates. Many parents eager for boys continue to have children until the desired number of sons are born, according to a report released Monday as part of the finance ministry’s annual economic survey. A lot of daughters are born during this process, too. The report estimates that these “unwanted” girls number more than 21 million. As they grow up, they often receive poorer nourishment and less schooling than their brothers. Despite those “unwanted” girls, India’s male-to-female sex ratio at birth still tilts significantly in favor of males. And it hasn’t improved even as incomes rise. The skewed ratio crosses socioeconomic classes. Even families in wealthier Indian states show a preference for having sons.  “The challenge of gender is long-standing, probably going back millennia, so all stakeholders are collectively responsible for its resolution,” the report’s authors write. “India must confront the societal preference ... which appears inoculated to development.”  For India as a whole, the sex ratio at birth is about 1,108 males per 1,000 females, the report states. In two higher-income states, Punjab and Haryana, the sex ratio for those between infancy and 6 years of age is even worse: 1,200 males per 1,000 females. The natural sex ratio at birth is about 1.05 males for every female, according to the report. How has the male-to-female ratio been skewed in India? Tests to determine the sex of a fetus are illegal in India, but families still test and then procure sex-selective abortions. The authors estimate these abortions, in conjunction with the country’s higher mortality rates for female children, have led to a gender gap of about 63 million women, whom they classify as “missing.” And yet the researchers also found that India had improved on several indicators of gender equality, including women’s education and women’s power to make decisions in their households.  “In some sense, once born, the lives of women are improving but society still appears to want fewer of them to be born,” the authors write. The report suggests several possible reasons for India’s preference for sons. Male offspring perform important religious rituals for their parents. Property is often passed down within the male line, while women are traditionally expected to move in with their husbands’ families, taking their labor with them. Sending a young woman to her new husband with a dowry has been illegal in India for decades, but many families still practice this custom. This means the birth of girls represents an extra financial burden for their parents. The authors of the report urge Indian society as a whole to reflect on this cultural preference for sons ― especially with the growing evidence that when women acquire greater personal agency and participate equally in the labor force, it can boost the economy of an entire country. “The intrinsic values of gender equality are uncontestable,” the authors write.",ratio,is,report
"The Senate’s iffy vote on Health Care Reform has been delayed once again, ironically over the health of one of the “yes” votes, Senator John McCain. McCain’s blood clot surgery at the Mayo Clinic is a timely illustration of what happens when a person of means is confronted with a life and death health dilemma. There’s far more here than simple partisan disputation, and this pause gives us a chance to delve into one specific difference between the left and the right concerning the government’s involvement in the health care industry. The GOP campaign promise to overturn Obamacare has at its core a deep Christian conflict so strong that one can say with a great degree of confidence that the issue really isn’t about health care. The driver is the Christian GOP’s worship of personal responsibility, one that benefits primarily the haves of our culture. Personal responsibility as a moral contract with culture is a personal, internal governor commonly referenced by conservatives - especially Christian conservatives - in considering social issues or problems. At core, it states that that human beings “choose, instigate, or otherwise cause their own actions.” It’s a neat, black and white, and ordered principle that ignores time and chance in the events of life, and has become more of a yardstick for measuring others than a genuine operating philosophy for life. This is especially true when arguments over God’s will are involved, for it’s a handy reference in attempting to explain the unexplainable. People starve in the ghetto, so it must be their fault for not living a lifestyle governed by personal responsibility. People get AIDS, because they don’t take personal responsibility for their behavioral actions. Just because others don’t take responsibility for their own choices, it doesn’t follow that I should have to pay for them. Sound familiar? And when tragedy strikes close to home, the personal responsibility demand can make amends for the loss of an explanation. A young mother is taken from a shopping center parking lot and brutally murdered, leaving a suffering family looking for answers. Someone, most likely a close relative, will ask what she was doing at the shopping center, and while some will be offended, others will nod on the inside. Some will insist it was the devil’s doing, and emphasize the need to be diligent in watching for “the evil one.” Still others will look to the murderer’s background as a reprobate and sinner who for whatever reason has rejected God. Few will argue time and chance, because they don’t have a place in this world of personal responsibility. The word “deserve” sneaks its way into the conversation of personal responsibility, for all black and white thinking comes with a reward for doing right. Hence, one “deserves” what they get, according to their own choices and actions. “Well, she got what was coming to her,” is a common phrase among those assigning blame for bad outcomes. Or how about, “He was such a nice man until he started drinking every day.” Here, there is no requirement to understand the why of this man’s drinking, because it’s irrelevant to the point of his behavior upon drinking. In other words, he deserves whatever the law does with him. Trial lawyers love this personal responsibility obsession, for if true, then there really is no such thing as an accident; someone is always to blame, and it’s hoped they have deep pockets. Lawyers are the guardians of the law, and no cultural group has more to gain from the worship of personal responsibility than they do. Lawyers, it should also be noted, serve as our representatives in Congress, so they actually make the laws that benefit their own kind. It’s a conflict of interest of staggering proportions, but that’s an argument for another time. Christian fundamentalists can find Scriptures to justify any of their beliefs, and there are plenty when it comes to personal responsibility. The verses most often quoted relate to family life. The below is from the evangelical fundamentalist “Got Questions Ministries” through GotQuestions.org: The Bible expects us to take personal responsibility in all areas of life. Able-bodied people should work for their food. “The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat” (2 Thessalonians 3:10). Men are to take responsibility for providing for their households (1 Timothy 5:8). At times, people try to avoid personal responsibility, usually through blame-shifting. Adam tried to blame Eve for his sin (Genesis 3:12). Cain tried to dodge responsibility (Genesis 4:9). Pilate attempted to absolve his guilt in the matter of the crucifixion of Christ: “‘I am innocent of this man’s blood,’ he said. ‘It is your responsibility!’” (Matthew 27:24). Ultimately, attempts to pass the buck are futile. “You may be sure that your sin will find you out” (Numbers 32:23). The whole book of wisdom found in Ecclesiastes contradicts everything about the worship of personal responsibility. Sometimes called “the book for cynics,” it is VERY important reading for today’s believers, for it speaks to the madness of black and white thinking. Here are two especially revealing verses, the latter being the Bible’s “shit happens” template: The worship of personal responsibility also plays a significant role - perhaps even the most central role - in the cultural divide between the haves and the have-nots. It functions as a form of moral superiority for the rich, because it leads to the argument of the American Dream of prosperity. At the other end of this spectrum is the argument that life can’t possibly prosper everyone, which is suggested by the black and white nature of the American Dream ideal. Surely, life is a zero sum game when it comes to resources, so this idea that we can all have it easy if we accept responsibility for our actions is just a bit problematic. For every winner, there must be a loser. As my friend Doc Searls likes to say, “Life is a death sentence; it’s just that some of us get to live it more comfortably than others.” If not, why this constant battle for resources, with the most stuff going to the previous winners in a game wherein the rules are tilted towards them before the starting whistle is even blown? Think about the University of Alabama in college football. It would be absurd to suggest that any other college could compete if they just took more responsibility for their athletic programs, for it’s Alabama’s ability to recruit 4 & 5-star athletes that, along with a great tradition and coaching, makes them such constant winners. There just aren’t enough of these resources to go all around the NCAA. The Gospel of Self is a perfect accompaniment for personal responsibility, for it begins with a personal relationship with a God who meets all our needs and rejects the realities of time and chance. Everything is ordered, for why wouldn’t God, after all, want to be good to those who acknowledge and worship Him? Behave a certain way, and you’ll be blessed. Moreover, demand that the whole culture behave this way, because it’s “God’s will” for everybody. This is the essential political and cultural drama being played out each and every day in the West in general and in the United States in particular. We’re hung up on arguing about the fruit of this conflict instead of talking about it directly. Like many other things in a culture afraid to talk about its religion, it helps explain our current conundrum in the debate over health care. Am I responsible for my decisions and actions? Of course, but the question is to what extent? Resolve that, and legislating its fruit – like health care – at least has a chance.",what,is,outcomes
"Means, motive, opportunity. For detectives, nailing down those is the perp trifecta. In Las Vegas, the forensic postmortem on the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history stands at two out of three. Means? Check. Opportunity? Check. But unless new evidence turns up, the killer’s motive is a black box. A missing motive is worse than frustrating. It disrupts the moral order. When humans act, in Coleridge’s phrase, with “motiveless malignity,” our wisdom traditions, the stories we typically soothe ourselves with, are disturbingly ineffectual. Not knowing why the cipher on the 32nd floor did what he did, not knowing why God did what God did, upends our beliefs about luck, meaning, evil, justice — the stuff of life and death. “What the detective story is about,” said P.D. James, the queen of crime fiction, “is not murder but the restoration of order.” Las Vegas was, devastatingly, not fiction, but it was and is a detective story. It came to us labeled as news, but we experienced it as narrative. It was visual, visceral, violent and shamefully riveting. It also illustrates James’ aphorism: The murderer may be dead, but absent a motive, we’re stuck in a random cosmos, where horrors like this can happen to anyone. Why did he do it? Was he a psychopath, driven by demons, severed from reality? No one who knew him saw it coming. If he could snap like that, who’s next? Was it for fame? Revenge? Was he abused? Or was it political? Did he hate us for our freedom? He left no note, no manifesto, no trail of terror — no reason, until his blaze of barbarity, for us to call him Other instead of Brother. Or did he do it, like a madman out of Dostoevsky, to demonstrate that God is dead? “I was agnostic going into that concert,” Taylor Benge, 21, his and his sister’s clothes covered in other people’s blood, told CNN, “and I’m a firm believer in God now, ’cause there’s no way that all of that happened, and that I made it, and I was blessed enough to still be here alive talking to you today.” The terror of that night is unimaginable. Like all Americans, I mourn its victims, and its survivors’ courage and generosity take my breath away. Yet — with respect —  I wrestle with the idea of a God who blessed Taylor Benge enough but who also made the monster of the Mandalay Bay. If the Benges’ survival is attributable to God’s benevolence, could the 58 killed, the more than 500 injured and the shooter who rained grief and death on them be chalked up to God’s negligence, perversity or impotence? Any restoration of order is tentative, because our human hands have enough free will to fail us. But to inhabit a world where arbitrary carnage is inevitable: that’s a lousy story to have to tell our tribe about the nature of existence. It limits God’s love. It imagines that God has abandoned us. It prompts some of us to source evil to an origin beyond God’s reach, to a Satan or an evil eye. It moves others to conflate mysticism with wishful thinking. It’s what led Gloucester, in King Lear, to drag our deities down to earth: “As flies to wanton boys are we to th’ gods. They kill us for their sport.” Taylor Benge experienced his survival as God’s grace. To interpret it, instead, as luck: that’s living life on the volcano’s edge. I’ve been there. It’s intolerable. On the cover of The Wall Street Journal on Oct. 6, there appeared a three-column image of a page from the 1970 Francis Polytechnic High School yearbook, above the headline, “The Life of a Mass Shooter.” To protect student privacy, all pictures but one were pixelated. The exception was a photo of the murderer as a junior. Pleasant face, healthy head of hair. Nice kid. In hindsight, uncanny and haunting. But no warning — no horns. The Journal’s reporters found nothing in his life that fits a mass killer’s profile. His final act might as well have fallen from the sky. The mass murder case is closed. The murderer of order, though, remains at large. Our life stories now include his story. Like it or not, his motiveless malignity points a bullet at our dreams of an unconditionally lovable God.

"From Mother Nature Network's Russell McLendon: A newborn horse in Virginia has scientists celebrating, and not just because she's cute. The still-unnamed filly isn't a regular domesticated horse — she's a Przewalski's horse, a formerly extinct species deemed the last true wild horse on Earth. She's also the first of her kind born via artificial insemination, a milestone seven years in the making. Przewalski's horses (pronounced ""sheh-val-skee"") were declared extinct in the wild 44 years ago, wiped out from their native China and Mongolia by hunting, habitat loss and livestock encroachment. Fourteen survived in zoos, and thanks to conservationists, they had enough offspring to begin reintroduction in the 1990s. Those horses then reproduced in the wild, and in 2008 the species was upgraded from extinct to endangered. There are now about 500 wild Przewalski's horses on Earth, all carrying the genes of those original 14 founders. Another 1,500 or so live at zoos and breeding centers, but boosting their numbers while maximizing genetic diversity can still be a challenge. ""It seems reasonable to assume that reproduction for the Przewalski's horse would be similar to domestic horses, but it simply isn't the case,"" says Budhan Pukazhenthi, a reproductive physiologist at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Virginia, where the foal was born on July 27. ""After all these years of persevering, I can honestly say I was elated to receive the call informing me that the foal had been born."" The value of artificial insemination is that it doesn't require both parents to be together for a successful mating, thus enabling better gene matches regardless of location. Moving the animals themselves can be expensive and dangerous, the SCBI explains in a press release, while the collection of semen is cheaper, safer and ""significantly improves the efficiency of managing small populations of endangered species."" The foal's mother, Anne, was born at SCBI to a mare from Europe and a stateside stallion renowned for his genes. Her father also lives at SCBI, so the use of artificial insemination was more about demonstrating its viability than geographic necessity. It required specialized animal-handling facilities, hormonal treatments to induce ovulation, and conditioning of Anne to provide urine samples for hormone monitoring and other tests. Anne's pregnancy was confirmed 35 days after insemination using ultrasound technology, and she was monitored closely by SCBI staff for more than 11 months. ""Anne is a young, first-time mother,"" says Dolores Reed, supervisory biologist at SCBI, in a statement. ""She had a normal pregnancy that lasted 340 days, and the foaling lasted less than 10 minutes. I've raised a lot of foals and other hoofed stock over the years, but this filly feels like an extra-special triumph for us and her species."" Przewalski's horses have never been tamed for riding, leading some to consider them the ""last truly wild horse in existence today."" Scientists at SCBI — along with collaborators from Auburn University in Alabama, the Wilds in Ohio and Conservation Centers for Species Survival — say the unprecedented birth of a Przewalski's foal by artificial insemination bodes well not just for her species, but for rare horses everywhere. ""This is a major accomplishment,"" Pukazhenthi says, ""and we hope our success will stimulate more interest in studying and conserving endangered equids around the world.""",filly,raised,us
"By Curtis Skinner SAN FRANCISCO, April 7 (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc agreed to a $25 million settlement to end a civil lawsuit in California that accused the ride-sharing company of misleading customers about the strength of its background checks on drivers, prosecutors in Los Angeles and San Francisco said on Thursday. Uber must pay $10 million within 60 days, and the remaining $15 million will be waived if Ubercomplies with the terms of the agreement for two years, the San Francisco and Los Angeles County district attorneys said in statements. ""It sends a clear message to all businesses, and to startups in particular, that in the quest to quickly obtain market share laws designed to protect consumers cannot be ignored,"" San Francisco District Attorney George Gascón said. Uber welcomed the settlement. ""We're glad to put this case behind us and excited to redouble our efforts serving riders and drivers across the state of California,"" it said in a statement. The case was filed in December 2014 by the two district attorneys, who alleged that Uber misled its customers about the strength of its background checks on drivers. The civil complaint also contended that Uber drivers work at airports without obtaining authorization, and in the case of San Francisco, charged a $4 extra fee to passengers traveling there, without paying anything to the airport. The agreement bars Uber from making untrue statements about its background checks and from charging airport ""tolls."" In addition, the company must ensure that its fare calculations meet state measurement standards. Uber said it has already made many of the changes, including no longer callings its service the ""safest ride on the road"" or calling its background checks ""the gold standard.""

" Music Maker Relief Foundation artist Dr. G. B. Burt. Photo by Tim Duffy. Courtesy of Music Maker Relief Foundation. Public folklorists like me often advocate for traditional arts, and for individual traditional artists. We try to increase funding, support, and participation in the art forms we work with, and we recommend artists for gigs, awards, grants, and other recognition. Although I'm in the government now, for a long time I worked in the non-profit sector, and I have great respect for the folks in those trenches, battling the forces of indifference and cultural homogenization in their attempt to preserve and present traditional folk arts. It's a tough job, and it requires a rare blend of idealism and street smarts, artistic sensitivity and practical life skills. Because of this, I'd like to draw your attention to the Music Maker Relief Foundation. They have two catchphrases, neatly summing up the double impulse of advocacy for the arts and support for the artist: ""Preserving the Soul of America's Music"" and ""Helping Artists Make It."" While they're based in the South and mostly support Southern styles like blues and old-time, their mission statement is more basic: ""Supporting American roots music."" Their programs include stipends to help struggling folk and blues musicians pay the bills for food, utilities, and medicine; support to help artists build their skills and advance their careers; mentorship programs to pass the arts on to the next generation; concert tours that take great unsung artists to places as prestigious as Lincoln Center and as far away as Australia; photography exhibits that raise awareness of traditional musicians and their work; and (of course) a label that has released over 150 albums.
Music Maker Relief Foundation artist Dom Flemons in February 2015.  Photo by Stephen Winick. It's this last feature that I'll focus on here, giving you a rundown of just a few of their recent releases, most of which have a pretty ""live-in-the-studio"" feel involving minimal production. If you like the kinds of music they present, chances are you're just fine with that. Before getting to the reviews, let me also recommend that you explore the Music Maker website at this link; there are videos and free streaming tracks from almost all their artists, and you could spend all day listening to free music on their generous site--while contemplating how much to give or what to buy, of course!  Now for reviews: first up is We Are the Music Makers! This double-cd compilation includes 44 tracks by almost as many artists. It's an entertainment experience, but it also reveals hidden styles found in the secret treasure-box of the Music Maker vaults, becoming an educational history of old-time music making. It includes human sound-effects like Whistlin' Britches' ""Clickin'"" and novelty tracks like Captain Luke's Jew's harp version of ""Freight Train Boogie,"" along with an interview segment with Guitar Gabriel about the meaning of the blues. But it's mostly a rich buffet of great roots music, ranging all over the (Southern U.S.) map in style and subject matter. The primary genre is blues, but there are healthy helpings of rootsy gospel like Carl Rutherford's ""Old Rugged Cross"" and Mother Pauline and Elder James Goins's ""Old Time Religion,"" as well as a few great old-time pieces like Benton Flippen's ""Benton's Dream"" and the Carolina Chocolate Drops' ""Sourwood Mountain."" Guitar styles alone range from Cool John Ferguson's intricate picking on ""No Hiding Place"" to songster-style strumming on Boo Hanks and Dom Flemons's ""Keep on Truckin'"" to the hot electric blues of Beverly ""Guitar"" Watkins on ""Back In Business."" (See the video below.) There's also boogie-woogie piano on Essie Mae Brooks's ""Feel Like My Time Ain't Long"" and Mr. Q's ""Cocktail Boogie,"" and archaic banjo styles on Neal Pattman's ""Shortnin' Bread"" (where the banjo is played by Taj Mahal) and Samuel Turner Stevens's ""Railroadin' and Gamblin'.  Beverly ""Guitar"" Watkins performs ""Back in Business."" Among the blues numbers, there are songs drawn from life on the farm, like Big Boy Henry's ""Old Bill,"" and others drawn from life on the street, like Adolphus Bell's ""Child Support Blues."" There's a fun grouping of songs with bawdy themes, including Willa Mae Buckner's ""Peter Rumpkin"" and Algia Mae Hinton's ""Cook Cornbread for Your Husband, Biscuits for Your Outside Man,"" both examples of old-time hokum blues, as well as Ironing Board Sam's ""Nothin' But Your Butt,"" which cooks along with an infectious funky beat. I should also mention that, although primarily African American and Anglo, the collection features Pura Fé and the Deer Clan Singers performing a Tuscarora song called ""Pigeon Dance,"" and Leyla McCalla singing a beautiful traditional song in Haitian Creole. We Are the Music Makers thus includes old and young, rural and urban, black and white, native and immigrant, archaic and modern. It's sprawling, diverse, and rich; worth buying, worth hearing, and worth exploring. Although it can't be summed up in one track, there's one that speaks loudly to the Music Maker mission: Dr. Burt's ""What Can an Old Man Do (but Sing the Blues)?""  See a video of that great song below. Dr. G. B. Burt performs ""What Can an Old Man Do (but Sing the Blues)?"" I don't have space to review all their compilations, but I'll briefly mention two more albums from a few years ago: Blues Sweet Blues Volumes One and Two, now available as a double CD. Those focus more tightly on the blues, but still have room for some great weirdness, like a psychedelic poem called ""Giant Squid."" It's another great collection, and highly recommended; for a preview, you can find the track list here, and hear some of the songs here, by clicking on individual artists. Live at the Hamilton presents a near-perfect evening of laid-back electric blues by Captain Luke and Cool John Ferguson, captured live in Washington, D.C. Captain Luke had a deep, smooth, smoky voice, perfect for the low parts in church and many blues songs to boot. Cool John's electric guitar playing is equal parts country blues and 70s rock. Together with the rhythm section of Sol Creech (bass) and Ardie Dean (drums), they put together a charming, atmospheric electric blues set that includes Tony Joe White's 60s hit ""Poke Salad Annie,"" Albert King's ""Angels of Mercy,"" and Slim Harpo's ""King Bee.""  One of my favorites is ""Old Black Buck,"" Captain Luke's own take on the folk genre of mule-driving songs. But no song suited his voice better than White's ""Rainy Night in Georgia,"" which is on the CD, and which you can watch as a video below. Captain Luke passed away about a month ago; he loved to exclaim ""Lord have mercy,"" about anyone and anything, and I'm sure that mercy will extend to his gentle soul. To remember him, we have this satisfying set, his two previous Music Maker albums, and the video below.  (We also have this very nice obituary from WUNC, featuring audio of Captain Luke and Tim Duffy's terrific StoryCorps interview recounting the genesis of the Music Maker Relief Foundation. The uncut interview can be heard in the archive where I work at the American Folklife Center of the Library of Congress.) Captain Luke and Cool John Ferguson perform ""Rainy Night in Georgia."" One of the youngest musicians on the label, the 19 year old Lakota John, has his own take on blues and gospel, informed by his Lumbee and Oglala Sioux heritage. His album Lakota John and Kin features buoyant arrangements of classics from Robert Johnson, Elizabeth Cotten, Jesse Fuller, and Charlie Patton, among others, plus some traditional songs. His guitar playing places easy strumming alongside demanding but tasteful slide work, and his soulful singing recalls Dave Van Ronk. The backing instruments, which include guitar, blues harp, fiddle, washboard and kazoo, are played by his dad, mom, and sister; sister Layla also sings excellent lead on three songs.  It's really fun, mostly upbeat, and does a great job of presenting old classics alongside some almost-forgotten treasures like Sippie Wallace's ""Women Be Wise,"" which you can hear in the video below. This impressive debut establishes Lakota John as a young musician to watch! Lakota John and Kin, featuring Layla Locklear, perform ""Women Be Wise."" Finally, I'll talk about one of the label's best known acts, Dom Flemons, who won a Grammy Award with his former band, The Carolina Chocolate Drops. Now mostly a solo act, Dom most recently released Prospect Hill. He proudly claims the label of ""The American Songster,"" establishing himself in the lineage of artists like Lead Belly, Mississippi John Hurt, and Henry Thomas, and Prospect Hill lives up to that promise. It presents a varied selection of old pieces, some traditional and others from commercial 78s. Highlights of the old repertoire include ""But They Got it Fixed Right On,"" which Flemons covers with exhilarating abandon, and ""Sonoran Church Two-Step,"" a laid-back but infectious fiddle tune from his native Arizona. Like the old songsters he so admires, Dom also creates fantastic original songs that fit right into the traditions he loves. His brand new piece ""Hot Chicken"" is destined to be a new classic of hokum blues. His originals ""San Francisco Baby"" and """"Til the Seas Run Dry"" might fool you into thinking you're listening to an old piece from Gus Cannon or Frank Stokes, but with a more modern flair for arrangement. (See a video of ""'Til the Seas Run Dry"" below.) Flemons even bravely tackles compositions in some of the more archaic styles of African American folk music, showing his chops on ""Grotto Beat,"" a piece in the fife-and-drum style collected by Alan Lomax and others in the Mississippi hill country. He's joined by a number of guests, including Guy Davis, himself a revered figure in folk music and a masterful proponent of the songster style. It's a telling partnership, and rewards the listener with several tunes that couldn't have been done by anyone else. They're joined by a banjo belonging to the late Mike Seeger and the guiding spirit of the late Pete Seeger, both of them mentors to Dom and Guy alike. You can feel the presence of both Seegers in every note of this brilliant work, which is easily one of my favorite albums of recent months, Dom Flemons performs ""Til the Seas Run Dry."" So those are the reviews. You can get the albums through the Music Maker Shop. But I know what you're thinking: ""What about that 'Free Album' you promised us?"" So here's the deal: when Dom Flemons was recording Prospect Hill, he found he had a number of outtakes and alternate versions that were worthy of being released. He put them on a vinyl-only album called What Got Over, and offered it as a Record Store Day special. Dom and Music Maker decided also to make it available as a free download for a limited time. They've extended that time a bit just for our readers, so head over to this link to get your free download.  And enjoy one more Dom Flemons original in the player below!

"James Sutter is a science teacher at Wellston High School, student population less than 500. Wellston, Ohio is a town of a little more than 5,000 people in southeastern Ohio near the West Virginia border. The town is 98 percent white and mostly Protestant. Only 12.7 percent of adults in the town age 25 or older have at least a college degree compared to almost one of three adults in the United States as a whole. Most students are from families that live below the poverty line. Wellston, located in Jackson County, used to be coal country and it is now Trump country. Donald Trump got 73 percent of the presidential votes cast in Jackson County in 2016. According to a recent article in the New York Times, Mr. Sutter has been having difficulty with some of the students in his classes, and their parents, because, like the President of the United States, they reject the reality of climate science. The article cited a specific conflict between Sutter and one of his students. When he “ascribed the recent warming of the Earth to heat-trapping gases released by burning fossil fuels like the coal her father had once mined, she asserted that it could be a result of other, natural causes.” In addition, “When he described the flooding, droughts and fierce storms that scientists predict within the century if such carbon emissions are not sharply reduced, she challenged him to prove it.” This student was only the “most vocal of a raft of student climate skeptics.” During one interchange, the student insisted that teachers “are supposed to be open to opinions.” Sutter responded, “It’s not about opinions. It’s about the evidence.” She answered, “It’s like you can’t disagree with a scientist or you’re ‘denying science.”’ On another occasion, the student, who was academically very strong, grew so agitated that she stormed out of the room. The Times article attributed the battles in Mr. Sutter’s classroom to the “culture wars” being played out in the United States. In a 2016 Pew public opinion poll only 22 percent Trump supporters believed that human activity is warming the planet. The Heartland Institute, which receives major funding from the fossil fuel industry, has distributed tens of thousands of copies of their propaganda material challenging climate science to teachers in an effort to undermine support for reigning in pollution, cutting back on the use of fossil fuels, and reversing climate change before there is a global disaster. The kind of issues raised in Mr. Sutter’s classroom are not just limited to disputes about climate change or to science classes. Creationist forces have long fought against the teaching of human evolution as part of the biology curriculum. In social studies classes during the last election cycle, some students echoed one of the Presidential candidates, repeating unsubstantiated claims they heard or read in alt-media. As a teacher educator I offer the following advice to pre-service and beginning teachers who face determined student, parent, and even administrative challenges that interfere with their ability to teach the mandated curriculum. I think this advice would be useful for Mr. Sutter. 1. You need to know your stuff, to do the research, to collect and evaluate the data, and to organize how it will be presented to students. It is okay to express uncertainty, but be clear about why you are uncertain and what more you feel you need to know. 2. Science is never about 100% certainty, but there are things scientists are really, really sure about. Science is always about making decisions based on experimentation, evidence, and consistent explanations. 3. Explain to students the purpose of what they are studying. Every class has an established curriculum. In this case, Mr. Sutter’s curriculum is understanding climate science, particularly evidence of the impact of human action on the environment. Information, analysis, and discussion must be consistent with established scientific principles and procedures and explanations must be based on evidence. The purpose of the curriculum in this case is to understand what scientists know about climate change and how they arrived at these conclusions. According to the State of Ohio Science Learning Standards: “Contemporary studies regarding global climate must be based on facts and evidence.” In high school, students are expected to be able to: Identify questions and concepts that guide scientific investigations; Design and conduct scientific investigations; Use technology and mathematics to improve investigations and communications; Formulate and revise explanations and models using logic and evidence (critical thinking); Recognize and analyze explanations and models; and Communicate and support a scientific argument.” The guidelines for Environmental Science include a section titled “Common Misconceptions.” It recognizes that “Students may have difficulty separating science from non-science factors as they relate to the different parts of the environment. It is important to distinguish “what is science” and therefore, what will be included in an environmental science class, especially as it relates to climate change and evolution. Identifying and understanding personal bias and ethical issues are an important step in recognizing science.” Additionally, “it is important to provide evidence of climate change throughout Earth’s history and current data to document temperature changes (surface and oceanic).” 4. It is crucial to establish guidelines for discussion. An important goal is to develop a classroom community where students are able to listen to each other and the teacher and to explore the curriculum together. No student, or group of students, has the right to monopolize discussion, to silence others, or to prevent a class from proceeding. Mr. Sutter and every teacher should welcome student questions, but questioning should not become a technique for disruption. 5. It is important for students who dissent from the curriculum or teacher presentations to feel they are respected and have a place in classroom discussion. In this case, I would offer the dissenting student or students the opportunity to conduct research and prepare a report explaining their critique of climate science. I would help the dissenters evaluate data and alternative explanations for climate change and if their reports were well-organized and consistent with the curriculum and established scientific practice, I would set aside time for the student or students to present in class and for the class to discuss their alternative perspective. This approach could have prevented must of the difficulties described in the Times article. Follow Alan Singer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ReecesPieces8",they,recognizes,environment
"It was a normal Sunday, nothing that would make it stand out from the 100s of other Sundays that came before it. But on that particular day, something happened that changed me forever. I was wearing a red and gold checkered churidar, my favorite one, the one that I wore slightly too often.  A churidar is an Indian outfit, typically worn by women and favored because of it’s modesty and comfort. It consists of a dress, pants, and a shawl. Mine was totally on trend, with the bodice being cut short so that it fell just above my knees, a contrast to the one my mother wore that fell at her ankles. It was the epitome of Indian fashion in the early 2000s. Service had just ended and I was anxious to leave soon so that I wouldn’t have to talk to too many people. I weaved and bobbed my way through the crowd as I headed to the back of the sanctuary trying to find my parents. I smiled and said hello to a few uncles and aunties but I kept moving. Until he blocked my path. He smiled, like he had 100 times before, called me molay, dear girl, and asked how I was. I gave him a shy smile and said that I was good. That’s when I noticed him coming closer. Before I could blink or take my next breath, I saw his hand reach out. He reached out and grabbed me. Down there. Then he squeezed me. Then he let go, and brushed past me. It happened fast. Lightening fast. Fast enough that his smile never left his face while he did it. Fast enough that not one of the 60-70 people surrounding us noticed. I stood there for a minute completely stunned and overwhelmed. Then I heard my name as my mom called me and said we were going home. ___ All these years later, what shocks me the most about that moment is the sheer audacity that he had in touching me in total public. He had no fear of being seen. He had no fear of me screaming. He had NO FEAR. Why? Because he knew that he would never be caught. He knew that even if I told my parents, which I did, we wouldn’t feel like we could do anything. He knew that he could get away with it, because he had gotten away with it before. You see, this man that violated me, also molested my friend not long before this incident. In the years that have passed since both of us were taken advantage of, I cannot imagine the countless number of young girls and boys he has had- and continues to have- access to. My biggest regret in my entire life is that I was not able to be the last person he ever molested. Some of you may read my description of the incident, and say that it wasn’t a big deal, at least I wasn’t raped. Or that I must be mistaken, he simply brushed his hand against me in the crowd. But I can confidently say that I have been in many crowds, and I have never been brushed like that before that day, or after. When you feel your crotch being squeezed, you know that it is intentional. Sure, it could have been worse, I was lucky that was all he did. But even at that age I knew that if he could do that to me so quickly and casually, he certainly would have no qualms doing much worse in private. And I was right. He has done much worse in private. Now, I am an immigrant from the Malayalee Pentecostal community. We are from Kerala, a state in South India that prides itself on having one of the largest Christian populations in the country and for having the highest literacy rate in the country. There are multiple Christian denominations present in Kerala, and my family converted to Pentecostalism in the early 1980s. Our culture is mishmash of Malayalee and traditional Pentecostal values. As a whole we are intelligent, industrious, and conservative. I recently shared a quick description of this on Facebook, joining the chorus of #MeToo. I posted it because I was frustrated that my Malayalee Pentecostal community refuses to talk about sexual abuse in any capacity. I have known too many Malayalee kids who have been sexually abused, and yet never once have I heard of an abuser being held accountable for their actions. After I posted my status, I received a request to take my post down. Apparently it made me look bad. Apparently it was shameful. No. The only thing that is shameful is that you want to silence me. Because you do not want be uncomfortable. You do not want to deal with this problem in the community. You do not want to believe that the person who sits next to you every Sunday is capable of such atrocity. I’ve been looked dead in the eyes and told by Malayalee aunties and uncles that I would go to hell because I wore nail polish and got my ears pierced. I’ve been told that wearing jewelry and dresses to church makes me unfit to teach Sunday School…yet these same people hear about sexual predators lurking around their churches and they keep quiet. I am now in seminary, and I work as a full time Children’s Minister in a church in Southern California. We background check every person that volunteers in our Sunday School. We have training where we talk about what it is appropriate touch and speech. To my fellow leaders in Malayalee Pentecostal churches, and other immigrant churches- do you talk about these things with your volunteers? Do you do background checks? Do you vet the people who have spiritual authority over your children? Don’t assume that because most of your volunteers are women you have nothing to worry about. Women have just as much capacity to be sexual abusers, and boys can be targets to be victims. Same sex abuse is also possible. To immigrant parents of young children- I am fortunate enough to have parents who are profoundly open with me and my sister. My mother talked to me from a very young age about being careful around people, and what I should deem as acceptable touch. I felt comfortable to tell my parents about the incident and I am grateful that they both believed me. They told me not to go near him. At that time that was all they felt they had the power to do. Parents, please have an open dialogue with your kids. You may think that they are too young, but it is never to early to teach them how they can protect themselves. Make sure that you can be the person that they trust to tell if they have been hurt. Lastly, if your child has the strength and bravery to tell you something happened, please believe them. The disbelief can sometimes hurt more than the abuse itself. You may ask why I am talking about this more than a decade later. I am talking about it now because I want our communities to stop being afraid of talking about our issues in public. Each time we shove an incident under the rug, we are creating an opportunity for that abuser to abuse another child. The mentality of ‘as long as it’s not my kid’ is disgusting. The first step is to actually talk about the fact that this is happening in our communities. The next step is to take action. Ideally, these abusers should be in jail. Ideally, they should be on the National Sex Offender Registry. Our children should be able to go to church without seeing the face of their abuser every week. I hope if you are reading this and you have been abused, or you have a child who has been abused, you will feel inspired to tell someone who can help you. Tell the Senior Pastor. Tell the Director of your Children’s Ministry. Tell the police. Tell someone who can protect the other children. Our immigrant churches are a safe haven for sexual predators. I, for one, am tired of protecting them. Need help? Visit RAINN’s National Sexual Assault Online Hotline or the National Sexual Violence Resource Center’s website.",he,is,life
"A woman who accused a former Mormon leader of rape filed a civil lawsuit against the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Wednesday, claiming the church did not properly respond when she reported the abuse decades ago. McKenna Denson, 55, says she was raped in 1984 by Joseph L. Bishop, the former president of a Mormon missionary training center (MTC) in Provo, Utah. Denson said she told local Mormon leaders about the assault numerous times over the years, but that the church failed to take action against the leader. Instead, she says, Bishop was allowed to continue holding leadership positions that placed him in charge of hundreds of Mormon youth.  Denson said that after trying to seek justice through the church for three decades, she’s “absolutely prepared” to fight it in court.  “I’m ready for this,” Denson said Thursday during a press conference in Salt Lake City. “I’ve been ready. I think what makes me feel even more confident [is], I’m right. It happened. I was raped at the MTC. The church covered it up, and they still promoted him to higher and higher positions of the church.” Bishop, who is now 85 years old, denies the rape allegations. In an interview with police last year, he admitted that he had taken Denson to a small “preparation room” at the center and “asked her to show him her breasts, which she did.”  Church spokesman Eric Hawkins told HuffPost in an email that the church is confident that the legal system will ensure a just result in this case. “Our hearts ache for all survivors of abuse, and the Church is committed to addressing incidents of abuse wherever they are found,” Hawkins wrote. “As this is now an active legal matter, we are unable to make further comment at this time.” In a previous statement, the church claimed that it did not impose formal discipline on Bishop because it was unable to verify the allegations against him. The church said it is investigating the alleged rape again and would take action against Bishop if it found the claims to be true. Denson’s lawsuit names Bishop and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as defendants, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. Denson’s lawyer, Craig Vernon, said his client is seeking to hold Bishop accountable and that he hopes the lawsuit will also reveal systematic problems the church’s handling of abuse allegations. On March 26, the church updated its guidelines on abuse prevention. The guidelines instruct church leaders to call a church helpline when they learn of possible abuse cases. The helpline reportedly connects the leaders to “legal and clinical professionals” who provide instructions on how to assist victims and comply with local requirements about reporting abuse.  Vernon said he wants the church to consider telling its leaders to take complaints directly to local authorities. “We want the church to consider whether it makes sense to instruct [leaders], if you find out about one of these crimes ... don’t call the helpline, call the police,” he said during Thursday’s press conference. Denson also brought up the church’s longheld practice of allowing local leaders, known as bishops, to conduct one-on-one “worthiness” interviews with young children. Some parents have complained that bishops are able to ask children invasive questions about their sexuality during these interviews.  The interviews have recently become a controversial subject in the Mormon church. Last week, about 1,000 people marched to the church’s headquarters to demand an end to the practice and make it a requirement for a parent or guardian to sit in on the interviews. The church’s updated abuse guidelines make this an option, not a requirement. In response to a petition from concerned Mormon parents, Hawkins, the church spokesman, issued a statement last December defending bishops’ interviews as an important part of the church’s ministry.  Denson said Bishop was able to groom her for abuse because she had already gotten used to the idea that it was OK to be alone in a room with an older man who asked her sexually explicit questions. She said the movement to change the church’s policies on bishop’s interviews was “absolutely vital” to her. “If I had been taught early on that it was not OK to be alone, one on one with a priesthood leader, no matter how high up he is, I honestly believe this would not have happened,” she said.",claims,said,Bishop
"Sir Winston Churchill once said ""We make a living from what we get, but we make a life from what we give."" It's an honor and privilege this Christmas to 'tip my hat' to an exemplary friend of nature -- the legendary Bob Barker. A 50-year career on television with the longest running daytime game show 'The Price is Right' is certainly remarkable. But there's another side to Bob Barker beyond his successful daytime job that is astonishing and brought an ear-to-ear grin across my face. 
Come on Down! He truly loves animals, ""I am one of millions of people who was just born with a deep love of animals. I have been devoted to animals since I can remember. As a kid I picked up strays and tried in my clumsy ways to help injured animals. I've done it all my life, and now I'm doing it on a much larger scale,"" says a spritely Barker. Barker who hails from Washington the Apple state has a nimble mind and sharp focus as one might expect from a man who holds a black belt in karate and trained rigorously with Chuck Norris. He also possesses an exquisite sense of humor and Bob Barker is a benevolent gentleman. Perhaps the fact that he's 1/8th Sioux gave him an advantage of being that much more 'hardwired' and sensitive to the Earth and its animals. Though he credits his dear late wife Dorothy Jo for turning him into an animal advocate. And make no mistake Bob Barker is global in his love, determination and splendid achievements in standing tall and protecting the Animal Kingdom.  Barker has testified before the U.S. Congress to ban elephant traveling shows. His tireless advocacy on behalf of the Animal Kingdom in South America helped pass a bill against using animals in circuses in Bolivia. And he picked up the tab to send 84 lions from circuses from Bolivia to the U.S. after the bill passed. ""I went to Denver to welcome the lions and they're in a sanctuary there now. I felt just as joyous at the slight of those beautiful lions as I did when I saw those elephants,"" said a jubilant Barker. This year (2013) Barker footed yet another $1M bill of moving three elephants from the Toronto Zoo to the Performing Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) sanctuary in California. In fact, one of his all-time favorite memories is, ""When I stood and watched those three elephants from the Toronto Zoo come off the bus and arrive at the PAWS sanctuary."" He graciously donated $2.5M to People for Ethical Treatment of Animals for their stunning Los Angeles office on Sunset Drive. On yet another occasion, Texas-based Wildlife Reserve & Rehabilitation reached out and asked Barker for $5,000 for an avian ventilator, but instead they received a gift 50 times larger. Lynn Curry, the founder of the center remembers it like this: ""Mr Barker placed a personal phone call to me and said he was sending $250,000 to support the purchase of the ventilator as well as many other things we need for all the animals we rescue."" The center receives over 5,000 animals a year at their 187-acre facility. Barker is a strong believer in education and knows that the only way to assure a better future for the Animal Kingdom is through excellence in the field of law. So he gave $1M to Georgetown University to support the study of animal rights. At his alma mater, Drury University, he created an animal ethics program with a donation of $1M. Then, a couple buildings away, he established a professorship in animal rights with another million-dollar donation. Post 9-11, Bob Barker's philanthropy also generously touched our Armed Service men and women. He donated $2M to Semper Fi Fund and personally helped 1,000 wounded and critically ill Marines, sailors, soldiers and their families. Barker became a vegetarian a long time ago. ""I became a vegetarian out of concern for the animals and I was a vegetarian for a very long time before I realized that many people do it out of concern for their health. Furthermore, the answer to enjoying life is nutrition. I recommend that you become a vegetarian and exercise if you want to enjoy the golden years,"" says a fit and active 90-year-old Barker. The story that moved me the most was his stalwart efforts to protect our ailing oceans from despicable poachers. Barker is a long-time supporter of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society and Captain Paul Watson. ""I'm delighted to be able to help Sea Shepherd Conservation Society in its mission to end the destruction of habitat and slaughtering of wildlife in the worlds oceans. There's a lot of talk about preserving our ecosystems and species, but this is one organization that puts their words into action,"" asserts Barker.

Barker also procured the helicopter for the Bob Barker boat naming it 'The Nancy Burney' after the President of the United Activists for Animal Rights, another organization he supports.

For 35 years of 'The Price is Right' Barker closed his shows with ""Help control the pet population, have your pet spayed or neutered."" The 'guru of spay neuter' is certainly doing it his way. His plan as he so delightfully revealed is to die broke. On behalf of all the Animal Kingdom and Armed Service men and women around the globe, we wish you a very Merry Christmas  -- Bob Barker!

"A team of archaeologists say they’ve made a potentially “seismic” discovery in Canada that could “rewrite the history of Vikings in the New World” -- and they did it with the help of medieval sagas and the latest satellite technology. Medieval sagas, considered to be masterpieces of literature from the Middle Ages, capture the stories of the intrepid Vikings -- the master seafarers and warriors who, starting around the 8th century, ventured beyond their Scandinavian homelands to raid and trade in foreign lands. According to these stories, many of them featuring “larger-than-life heroes,” the Vikings had made the first European voyage to North America -- at least 500 years before Christopher Columbus. But the question has long remained: Just how much fact was interwoven into these sagas, which Icelandic monks wrote in the 13th and 14th centuries? And if laced with truth, just how much of the New World did the Norse really explore? In the 1960s, archaeologists determined that a site on the northernmost tip of Newfoundland in Canada -- L'Anse aux Meadows -- had been a Viking settlement, established about a millennium before. The discovery changed the history of European exploration in the New World and proved the sagas were not simply works of fiction. L’Anse aux Meadows, however, had merely been a temporary settlement, which the Norse abandoned after a few short years. Archaeologists have since been searching for clues of other Viking expeditions in North America; but in the past half-century, nothing concrete has been found. Until now. Thanks largely to the work of Sarah Parcak, a leading space archaeologist, evidence has been unearthed of a possible second Viking site in North America -- and it’s located about 300 miles further south than L’Anse aux Meadows. The site at Point Rosee, which Parcak pinpointed after analyzing satellite imagery, is located on the southwest coast of Newfoundland, The New York Times reports. 2nd #Viking settlement in North America may have been discovered in Point Rosee Nfld pic.twitter.com/Kb9QBeBUqO “I am absolutely thrilled,” she told the BBC of the new find. “Typically in archaeology, you only ever get to write a footnote in the history books, but what we seem to have at Point Rosee may be the beginning of an entirely new chapter.” “This new site could unravel more secrets about the Vikings, whether they were the first Europeans to ‘occupy’ briefly in North America, and reveal that the Vikings dared to explore much further into the New World than we ever thought,” added Parcak, who won the $1 million TED prize last year for her pioneering work using satellite data for archaeological purposes. Last summer, Parcak and a team of archaeologists conducted a test excavation at Point Rosee, and uncovered an “iron-working hearth [and some cooked bog iron] partially surrounded by the remains of what appears to have been a turf wall,” The National Geographic reports.  The team said they can’t yet say for certain that the Vikings built the hearth, but the signs are encouraging.  The turf wall is “nothing like the shelters built by indigenous peoples who lived in Newfoundland at the time, nor by Basque fishermen and whalers who arrived in the 16th century,"" according to Nat Geo. And Douglas Bolender, an archaeologist who specializes in Viking settlements, said there “aren’t any known cultures -- prehistoric or modern -- that would have been mining and roasting bog iron ore in Newfoundland other than the Norse.”  Bolender told the BBC that the Point Rosee discovery “has the potential to change history.” “The sagas suggest a short period of activity and a very brief and failed colonization attempt. L’Anse aux Meadows fits well with that story but is only one site. Point Rosee could reinforce that story or completely change it if the dating is different from L’Anse aux Meadows. We could end up with a much longer period of Norse activity in the New World,” he told Nat Geo. One of the reasons why the Vikings have been so hard to track down is because of the way they moved around. “They travelled light and left nothing behind, No massive stone theatres for them. They voyaged in longships with a strong oak keel ... [and] sails spun from wool,"" historian Dan Snow writes for the BBC. ""Food was pickled herring, lamb smoked using reindeer droppings, fermented salmon. Almost everything on a Viking ship would get recycled or rot away.” But, thanks to satellite imagery, Parcak believes that even the elusive Vikings can be found. In the case of Point Rosee, for instance, it had been irregularities in the soil -- “a dark stain,” according to the Times -- that initially piqued her interest.   “For a long time, serious North Atlantic archaeologists have largely ignored the idea of looking for Norse sites in coastal Canada because there was no real method for doing so,” Bolender told Nat Geo. “If Sarah Parcak can find one Norse site using satellites, then there’s a reasonable chance that you can use the same method to find more, if they exist. If Point Rosee is Norse, it may open up coastal Canada to a whole new era of research.” Parcak’s Point Rosee findings will be explored in greater detail in the two-hour television documentary, “NOVA: Vikings Unearthed,” that will premiere online on Monday at 3:30 p.m. EDT and will be broadcast in the U.S. on Wednesday, April 6, on PBS at 9 p.m. EDT.",that,been,interest
"“The ugly kike Erin Schrode from Marin County hilariously got shot by a rubber bullet as she was making trouble on the behalf of the low-IQ redskins in North Dakota.” “I’m just sad the bullets were rubber, like the world needs another Talmudic anti human psychopath.” “Bullets don’t work on these rodents. Try Zyklon B.” Zyklon B is the toxic gas which Nazis used to kill Jews en masse in concentration and extermination camps throughout Germany. Nazis. Racists. Bigots. Sexists. Supremacists. Call these monsters what they are. I am done with the term “Alt-Right” for those who are effectively modern-day Nazis and Ku Klux Klan, for those who attack me personally with unspeakable, unabating venom, for those who brutally and inexcusably denigrate Jews, women, people of color, LGBT, immigrants, Muslims, the list goes on. The name “Alt-right,” like “white nationalists,” sanitizes a ghastly rhetoric and acutely dangerous agenda, akin to Nazis or the KKK. This is no longer a fringe group, not a few lone actors under the cloak of darkness, no small subset of anonymous individuals; this is a concerted effort currently embedding itself in the heart of Washington, D.C. — policymakers, lobbyists, think tanks, institutes, and the new administration itself — in attempt to mainstream monstrous views and tactics that support a white majority and pro-white ideals they treasure and promote. A physical, offline hub is emerging with a vengeance for the group and ideology that gained traction and rose to prominence across the internet. During my congressional run in June, two articles came out about me in Jewish publications. In response, I received a deluge of thousands of neo-Nazi attacks and threats, to a degree that necessitated involvement of the FBI. The vicious onslaught against my “filthy Jewess” self — that wanted to “fire up the oven” and “laugh with glee as they gang raped her and then bashed her bagel eating brains in” — originated with the same neo-Nazi propaganda machine that endorsed Trump for president. It has not ceased. Earlier this month, I was shot by police with a rubber bullet while interviewing a Native American man about the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock — triggering an increase in frequency and intensity. The firing of a grenade launcher against me was entirely unprovoked without any violence, aggression or even words exchanged with armed law enforcement. Officers on the far bank of the river were inexcusably assaulting peaceful Water Protectors with pepper spray and mace, when one militarized cop shot me from his nearby perch on a motorboat. I have been reeling from physical and emotional trauma, while asking myself: Why? Why was I shot? Was I targeted? Was it random? “You were shot because you are a filthy kike. It’s obvious. Maybe, anuddah shoah just has begun.” I was born Jewish. My mother is Jewish. I identify as Jewish. In the eyes of neo-Nazis, that is reason enough to mount a relentless campaign. My being shot at Standing Rock spurred a new wave of evil, which I only learned of when an email with the subject line “you got shot! lol” appeared in my personal inbox. “Dumb parasite jew. Hilarious!” it read, with a link to a chatroom boasting hundreds more despicable comments and bastardized images. My rational self knows that there is zero justification for the use of such indiscriminate force against me — or worse against other Water Protectors, native and non-native, in the present day or over a history of hundreds of years of oppression — yet I cannot help but question the incident. I walked into the Sheriff’s office to file the police report with newfound fear of assault or arrest: if police can fire a grenade launcher at the back of an innocent journalist without reason, what other crimes can they commit? And what crimes have, do or will certain officers perpetrate, specifically against people of color who are targeted, killed, charged and imprisoned at dramatically higher rates than their white counterparts? As the story of me (a white female ally) being shot gained traction — largely because I inadvertently captured the moment on video — the response across social media was largely outrage. People were appalled by the dramatic incident itself, disproportionately militant police response, lack of mainstream media coverage and saddened by the pain, trauma, and tragedies being perpetrated once again upon Native Americans and their sacred lands. But, as has become the norm for me, anti-Semites lashed out in full force as well. “You can see the video on her Twitter and hear her pain. It’s hilarious!” You can indeed see for yourself on Twitter and Facebook. But nothing about anti-Semitism, supremacy, bigotry or racism is normal. Horrific words and behavior must not become my norm. We cannot allow the barbarous to be normalized. “The alien Erin Schrode just shrugged it off, and continued wreaking destruction to our country.” I try not to read or lend credence to the thousands of posts and messages I receive, but that becomes unavoidable when constantly popping up in my inbox and social feeds. My coping mechanism has become an attempt to downplay or assuage, but I refuse to do so any longer. Do not normalize. Do not sanitize. Do not condone. For that is to empower, breed and propagate. President-Elect Donald Trump has appointed Steve Bannon as his Chief Strategist — the same Steve Bannon who ran Breitbart News, which he boasts as being “THE platform of the alt-right movement.” Just go read the headlines like “Renegade Jew,” “Birth control makes women unattractive and crazy” or “Gay rights have made us dumber, it’s time to get back in the closet.” No, Bannon was not in the room in Washington, D.C. this week when hundreds of neo-Nazis and white supremacists gathered at a conference put on by the misleadingly-named National Policy Institute, the leaders of the newly emboldened “Alt-Right,” and proclaimed “Hail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!” with a Nazi salute — but he is the movement’s top propagandist and key enabler. Bannon gave extremism a digital home, a hub, a launchpad — and because this extremism is the type which preys upon minorities and not ISIS or jihadists, for which anyone would be promptly imprisoned, he will now advise the president of the United States from within the Oval Office.  Someone with the username Vote Trump told me, “Organize and pack your bags. January is coming soon” with a photo of an El-Al Israeli plane. I am not Israeli; I have no family in Israel; we are five-plus generations in the United States of America. This racist narrative parallels that of black people being told to “go back” to Africa or Latinos to “go back” to Mexico, or any immigrant to “go back” where they “belong.” We belong right here in America; that diversity and rich history of immigration is precisely what makes our country great. Anti-Semitism and racism are on the uptick in America today, as are violent views, words and actions against immigrants, Muslims and women, among other target groups. The Southern Poverty Law Center has recorded well over 700 hate crimes since the election. CNN hosted a roundtable on the “Alt-Right” leader questioning whether Jews were people. I feel myself becoming unfazed, almost numb to the heinous rhetoric and videos of hate speech on television, at schools, on streets, and in communities across the country. The very fact that this has been normalized is the most alarming red flag. It is up to us to recognize, name and denounce hate speech and discrimination when we see it, to drive out a wave of darkness that has the power to poison hearts and minds, bring down institutions and society, and reverse centuries of progress and victories — while posing imminent danger to the safety and wellbeing of millions of human beings. We cannot wait and see what type of administration this will be; we know in concrete terms. It is one that condones anti-Semitic views, racist tendencies, discriminatory policies, blatant sexism, and white supremacy. We must stand in solidarity with and do all we can to protect the persecuted and most vulnerable among us. We can neither yield to nor compromise with bigotry.",Nazis,Try,Germany
"By Carolyn Jones Since Donald Trump was elected president, more than 100 California school districts have declared themselves ""sanctuaries"" or ""safe havens"" for undocumented immigrant children. As the debate over immigration heats up, more districts are expected to follow suit. But do these resolutions have much impact? Do they really protect students, or are they just a rhetorical band-aid? And are these districts risking federal funding? Here are some answers. What does it mean when a district calls itself a “safe haven” or a “sanctuary” district? Some elected school boards have declared their districts “safe havens” or “sanctuaries,” which means they offer protections and create a welcoming environment for students and families who are undocumented immigrants. Definitions of “sanctuary” vary from district to district, but in most cases it means that school staff will not allow federal immigration agents on campus without a warrant, subpoena or court order. Any request by immigration agents to enter a campus, or obtain information about students, would have to be approved by the superintendent or the school district's legal staff. In addition, many districts won’t collect immigration information from students when they enroll. Some districts also work with local legal aid and social service nonprofits to help immigrant families facing deportation, and otherwise try to create a welcoming atmosphere for students by promoting tolerance and inclusion. In declaring themselves “sanctuaries,” school boards often cite a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Plyler vs. Doe, which states that school districts cannot deny students an education based on their immigration status. As Oakland Unified notes on its website, “We stand behind our students no matter where they were born or the barriers they have overcome to be here. We cherish the cultural richness in our district and make no exceptions when it comes to including learners with a wide variety of backgrounds and needs.” Under a federal policy, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents are prohibited from making arrests at ""sensitive locations,"" which include schools, churches, hospitals and protest rallies, except under circumstances they consider urgent or with permission from a site supervisor, according to the ICE website. Is there a different between a district calling itself a ""safe haven"" or a ""sanctuary"" district? No. Some districts opted for the labels ""safe haven"" or ""safe zone"" as a way to potentially avoid the Trump Administration's threats against sanctuary jurisdictions. But in most cases the resolutions offer the same protections. Does a school or district run the risk of having federal funds cut off if it passes a safe haven or sanctuary resolution? It's too soon to know. The Trump Administration has threatened to withhold federal grants from local governments — including schools, possibly — that declare themselves “sanctuaries.” But in April, a federal judge ruled in favor of two California counties (San Francisco and Santa Clara) that had sued the president over the order, claiming that the White House does not have the authority to force local police to carry out federal immigration laws. The Trump Administration appealed the ruling. In May, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo saying that sanctuary jurisdictions would only lose grants from the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security, not the federal government generally. Schools in California rely on federal funds for special education, free and reduced-price lunches, teacher training and other expenses. Federal funds account for about 10 percent of the total California spends on public K-12 education. But school police departments are eligible for, and often receive grants from the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security. Sessions left the door open to further changes in his crackdown on sanctuary jurisdictions, however. ""Nothing in the Executive Order limits the Department's ability to point out ways that state and local jurisdictions are undermining our lawful system of immigration or to take enforcement action where state or local practices violate federal laws, regulations, or grant conditions. ... Going forward, the Department, where authorized, may seek to tailor grants to promote a lawful system of immigration,"" he wrote in the memo. What is the main purpose of passing a resolution? School officials say that fear of deportation has led some immigrant families to keep their children home from school. Schools’ budgets are based on average daily attendance, so the fewer students, the less money. Districts have also said that the anti-immigrant rhetoric coming from Washington has led some children to feel anxious or worried, which affects their school performance. Resolutions are intended to reassure students and their families that schools will offer welcoming environments, will not seek or pass on information about students' or parents' immigration status to law enforcement authorities, and will do what they can to keep immigration authorities off school campuses. About 6 percent of California’s population are undocumented immigrants, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. An estimated 12.3 percent of California’s K-12 school children have at least one undocumented parent, according to the Pew Research Center. How many districts in California have passed such resolutions?  Have any faced retaliation or legal consequences as a result of passing them? As of June, 113 school districts and county offices of education,with enrollments totaling 2.7 million students, have declared themselves sanctuaries or safe havens, according to the California Department of Education. Some, such as San Francisco Unified, have been sanctuary districts for more than a decade, but most others adopted the term since the November 2016 election. Most of the state’s largest school districts are on the list, including Los Angeles Unified, Long Beach Unified, San Diego Unified, San Francisco Unified, Fresno Unified, Sacramento Unified, San Jose Unified and Stockton Unified. In addition, the University of California, California State University and California Community College systems have also declared themselves sanctuaries. Those schools represent an additional 1.2 million students. None of California’s sanctuary or safe haven districts have been subject to lawsuits or other backlash, according to the American Civil Liberties Union and California Department of Education What if a district doesn’t want to call itself a “sanctuary” or “safe haven” district?  Can they still pass similar resolutions without using those labels?  Yes. Long Beach Unified, for example, passed a resolution that uses neither term. Instead, the resolution simply states that the district affirms “its protection of students regardless of immigration status.” But like sanctuaries and safe havens, the district promises not to cooperate with federal immigration agents without a warrant. Some districts avoid the term “sanctuary” — opting instead for “safe haven” — because of the Trump Administration’s threats to withhold funding for sanctuaries. In any case, the definition of “sanctuary” has been in flux. In his Jan. 25 executive order on immigration, President Donald Trump describes “sanctuary jurisdictions” as those that “willfully violate Federal law in an attempt to shield aliens from removal from the United States. These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our Republic.” The U.S. attorney general will ultimately decide what jurisdiction is a sanctuary, according to the order. Sessions' May memo clarified the definition of “sanctuary” as any jurisdiction that withholds information about an individual’s immigration status from federal agents. Most so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, including schools, avoid that by not collecting immigration data to begin with. Where can I find examples of model resolutions?  State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson cited Sacramento City Unified School District's resolution as a model for other districts to follow: Sacramento City Unified safe haven resolution. Oakland Unified created a sanctuary web page that includes its resolution, referrals to immigrant rights and community groups, and information about immigration law. The information is available in English, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Khmer and Vietnamese. Los Angeles Unified, which has an immigrant population that's among the state's largest, has passed numerous resolutions in support of immigrants, most recently in May. The district also maintains an immigration hotline and web page of resources for immigrant families, in multiple languages. This story originally appeared on EdSource.org",Schools,rely,lunches
"By Sharon Bernstein SACRAMENTO, Calif., Sept 20 (Reuters) - California's first  regulations on fracking and related oil production practices  will go into effect next year in the most populous U.S. state  under a bill signed into law on Friday by Democratic Governor  Jerry Brown. Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is the practice of  injecting water, sand and chemicals underground to crack rock  formations and free up oil and natural gas. The technology makes  it possible for oil companies to unlock California's vast  Monterey Shale deposit, estimated to hold 15.4 billion barrels  of recoverable oil. But environmentalists across the nation have decried the  practice, saying that the chemicals used in the process pollute  underground water supplies and cause other damage. New York has  instituted a moratorium on fracking, and Illinois Governor Pat  Quinn signed a strict set of regulations into law in June. The California law would require oil companies to obtain  permits for fracking as well as acidizing, the use of  hydrofluoric acid and other chemicals to dissolve shale rock. It would also require notification of neighbors, public  disclosure of the chemicals used, as well as groundwater and air  quality monitoring and an independent scientific study. The hotly contested bill drew strong opposition from many  environmentalists, who said it did not go far enough and  complained that a proposed moratorium was taken out, along with  some tougher regulations. In his signing statement, Brown, who favors some level of  fracking in the Monterey Shale, said he believed more changes  would be necessary even as the law goes into effect next year. ""The bill needs some clarifying amendments, and I will work  with the author in making those changes next year,"" Brown said.  He did not specify what changes he wanted to make. State Senator Fran Pavely, a Democrat who represents the Los  Angeles suburb of Agoura Hills and was the author of the new  law, said the regulations would stop oil companies from fracking  in the state without full disclosure of their methods. ""Oil companies will not be allowed to frack or acidize in  California unless they test the groundwater, notify neighbors  and list each and every chemical on the Internet,"" Pavely said.  ""This is a first step toward greater transparency,  accountability and protection of the public and the  environment."" Opposing the measure along with the environmentalists was  the oil industry, which said the new law could make it difficult  for California to reap the benefits offered by development of  the Monterey Shale, including thousands of new jobs, increased  tax revenue, and higher incomes for residents. The law ""could create conditions that will make it difficult  to continue to provide a reliable supply of domestic petroleum  energy for California,"" said Catherine Reheis-Boyd, president of  the Western State Petroleum Association, which represents oil  companies in California. The law will go into effect Jan. 1, 2014.     (Reporting by Sharon Bernstein; Additional reporting by Rory  Carroll; Editing by Cynthia Johnston and Eric Beech)",Brown,said,changes

"DALLAS ― John Lott, the National Rifle Association’s favorite academic and gun researcher, had a question for the mostly older, white, male crowd seated in front of him. How many of them had heard someone say that federal gun research has been stymied for years because of Congress? Or that the U.S. has a uniquely high rate of gun homicide compared to other nations? Or that guns make suicide easier? All those claims were lies, he said, told by gun control advocates and repeated by an unquestioning media intent on pushing an anti-gun agenda. Over the weekend the NRA held its 147th annual convention, and Lott, whose highly discredited book More Guns, Less Crime, is considered the bible of the gun lobby, addressed a packed room inside the Kay Hutchison Convention Center here in downtown Dallas. For three days, gun rights enthusiasts gathered to peruse the newest firearms and gear, attend educational seminars such as “Refuse to be a victim: Crime prevention strategies,” and “14 factors impacting your shooting performance under duress,” and to simply have fun. Many were also there to send a pointed political message: NRA, we support you. The NRA is now on the defense as it faces off against a country that is mostly fed up with current gun control laws that did not prevent horrific mass shootings like those that took place in Las Vegas, Sutherland Springs, Texas, and most recently in Parkland, Florida. Since February, the U.S. has witnessed nationwide protests, student walkouts and countless state legislative wins. This coming November, advocates promise to vote out politicians who take money from the NRA, which opposes virtually every state and federal effort to tighten existing gun laws or pass any new gun safety measures. At the convention, many attendees disputed the idea that gun control is gaining momentum.  Instead, they said it was a false narrative created by the media. Fake news, in other words. Many participants told HuffPost that journalists ignore positive stories about guns, such as home invasions thwarted by gun owners. They said the media spends a disproportionate amount of time covering gun violence. “It’s what the press chooses to cover,” said Brian Lilly, 49, who attended the convention for the first time this year, alongside his father and his 18-year-old son, Benjamin. “They are censoring what the true pulse of the citizenry thinks.” When his son, a high school senior, was asked what he thought about his fellow students who were advocating for gun control, he exhaled sharply. “I think they want to get out of class,” he said. “It’s what’s on the news. They can’t back up their claims. They don’t know what they’re talking about.” The biggest misperception about guns is that “they’re always used for bad things and they’re not used for good,” he said. Dante Martin, 52, agreed. He stood at the Beretta booth, testing out a semi-automatic handgun he was looking to potentially acquire for his wife. It was his first convention despite being an NRA member for a decade. This year, he brought his 15-year-old son as a reward for getting good grades. “Guns don’t kill people ― people kill people,” Martin said. “Everyone has sympathy for people who were killed in these horrific events, but how many people are killed by drunk drivers? Where’s the outrage there?” He, like others interviewed, said that if guns were removed, perpetrators would just use vehicles to commit mass murder. “Without your second amendment rights, all the other [amendments] are just suggestions,” he added. Inside the sprawling exhibit hall, giant photos of NRA leaders bore down on members as they pointed and pulled the triggers of unloaded firearms, the sound of metallic clicks filling the air. There was a tone of jubilance and celebration. A poster with a silhouette of a woman carrying a grocery bag in the dark asked ominously if she was “trained for what’s around the next corner.” Dozens of people lined up to try a virtual reality simulator to test their firearm skills in a self-defense scenario. As people examined firearms on the floor, it was common to see them pointed directly at passersby.   Outside the convention, cars decked out with enlarged photos of victims of gun violence circled the center, weaving between an endless stream of convention-goers as they crossed the street. Protesters gathered on Friday and Saturday to rally against the gun group but were greatly outnumbered by the more than 87,000 people who attended the NRA event, which set a new record.  The site of the convention was notable for its proximity to two historic acts of violence. It is blocks from where Lee Harvey Oswald assassinated President John F. Kennedy, using a mail-order rifle he bought from an ad in the NRA’s American Rifleman magazine, and the location of a police ambush in 2016 in which five police officers were killed. Manuel Oliver, whose son Joaquin was fatally shot at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, implored President Donald Trump to listen to survivors as he painted a mural on Saturday, in front of hundreds of protesters.   “I’m impressed with the support that the NRA got from our president yesterday,” Oliver said, his voice strained. “I haven’t heard from President Trump the name of my son, not even once.” Speaking in front of the NRA on Friday, Trump appeared comfortable and happy, buoyed by the enthusiasm of the crowd who laughed uproariously at his jokes. In a typically meandering speech, he made fun of John Kerry for breaking his leg and thanked rap artist Kanye West for boosting his poll numbers among black Americans. He also mimicked the mass shooting at the Bataclan theater in Paris using finger guns. No one laughed at that. He urged NRA members to get out and vote in November. “We cannot get complacent,” he said. “We have to win the midterms.”  Attendees said they were not fazed by Trump’s inconsistencies on gun rights. After the Parkland shooting, he suggested that firearms should be immediately confiscated from people deemed dangerous, raising alarms among gun rights proponents.  “I think he’s in our corner,” said Mr. Nichols, a retired military member from San Antonio who only gave his last name. “I tend to look at his actions, not always what he says.” “The only thing I wish he would do is stop tweeting,” said a 52-year-old Texas man who only wanted to be identified by his first name, Donald. “Shut up and get offline.” Donald said he was a “lifetime member” of the NRA, a level of membership which costs $1,500 and does not ever need to be renewed. He was at the convention with his wife and son. All three work in their family-owned barbecue restaurant, which has been broken into five times. They keep a gun on site for protection. His son become a lifetime NRA member earlier that day.  The NRA are “on the front lines, fighting for our rights,” Donald said. “Individually, I don’t feel like I have any power, but as part of a group I do.”",It,was,decade
"The Society of Behavioral Medicine (SBM) has issued a new position statement recommending that middle and high school start classes no earlier than 8:30 a.m.— and is urging local, state, and national leaders to take action to help schools make this change. Such a schedule gives students a chance to get healthy sleep and has been shown to improve physical health, psychological well-being, attention and concentration, academic performance, and driving safety. With this call to action, the SBM joins a long list of notable health groups making similar recommendations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, the National Association of School Nurses, and the Society of Pediatric Nurses. Calls to start school later are based on well-documented biologic changes during puberty that shift sleep cycles later than those of younger children or older adults. Even teenagers with reasonable bedtimes cannot get sufficient sleep if they wake for school at dawn. Disrupting the natural sleep cycle impairs mental and physical health, safety, and learning. The SBM recognizes that this change will require a multi-pronged effort from a wide variety of stakeholders, from students and parents to sleep professionals to policymakers. They recommend a four-tiered approach to promote later start times for middle and high schools: 1. School board members “must enact an 8:30 a.m. or later school start time policy in their school districts. It is fundamentally at the school district level that administrators can prioritize school start times that promote students’ health, well-being, and learning.” 2. State departments of education and state legislators, “should advocate for later school start times for middle and high schools. This advocacy can be achieved by including student healthy-sleep promotion on committee agendas and by lobbying school board members to enact an 8:30 a.m. or later school start policy.” 3. Health and education advocates “should lobby the U.S. Department of Education through congressional representatives, particularly those on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, so they understand the value of later school start times and can enact pertinent legislation.” 4. School communities should raise awareness. SBM suggests “school-level promotion of education about the importance of sleep through in-services, workshops, curriculum changes, and family and community events.” They also urge media to “to promote the public’s understanding of the benefits of later school start times for middle and high school students..” The new statement has been endorsed by the National Education Association (NEA), National Parent Teacher Association (National PTA), Start School Later, Parents for Public Schools, and the Sleep Research Society. Stacy Simera, Start School Later’s Communications Director, says it is no surprise that a society of behavioral health professionals is joining forces with other health and education groups on this issue. Behavioral health professionals were among the earliest proponents for healthy school start times, she says, dating back to Minnesota psychiatrists who pushed for later start times in their state in 1993.  She encourages colleagues across the nation to speak to their local school boards and state lawmakers about the need for healthy school start times.  ""Child health is worth adult effort,"" she says. And that effort is making a difference. As the SBM statement concludes: “It is no longer a question of whether policies promoting later school start times should be adopted but rather how they should be implemented.” Visit Our Website | Sign Our National Petition | Join Our Newsletter | Follow us on Facebook | Join a Chapter | Make a Donation Follow Terra Ziporyn, PhD on Twitter: www.twitter.com/terraziporyn",schedule,gives,safety
"LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Deadpool might not consider himself a superhero, but its latest installment is off to a powerful start. The Marvel Comics film from 20th Century Fox debuted in North American with $125 million in 4,349 locations. That wasn’t enough to match the debut of its predecessor, 2016′s “Deadpool,” which had the biggest opening ever for an R-rated film with $132.4 million. The Ryan Reynolds-starrer bowed overseas with $176 million for a global weekend total of $301 million. Although it debuted under estimates, “Deadpool 2′s” launch was nothing to complain about. It still secured the second-best opening for an R-rated film, as well as the third-biggest debut of the year behind Marvel blockbusters “Avengers: Infinity War” and “Black Panther.” It also secured Fox its second-highest opening weekend in history. The sequel is still boasting a promising critical consensus, with an 84 percent Rotten Tomatoes rating and an A CinemaScore. “Deadpool 2′s” strong debut is a testament to Reynolds, according to Fox’s president of domestic distribution Chris Aronson. “I just can’t say enough about him,” Aronson said. “Not just the character, but promoting it. I feel great about this opening.” Its opening was enough to crush “Avengers: Infinity War’s” reign on the domestic box office. After securing the No. 1 spot for three weeks, the Disney and Marvel superhero tentpole dropped to second place. Its fourth weekend haul was still impressive, reeling in $29 million from 4,002 screens. “Infinity War’s” domestic tally currently sits at $595.4 million. “Infinity War” was followed by Paramount Pictures’ new release, “Book Club.” The romantic comedy ― starring Diane Keaton, Jane Fonda, Candice Bergen, and Mary Steenburgen ― came in slightly ahead of expectations, earning $12.3 million on 2,781 screens. The weekend’s other newcomer, Global Road Entertainment’s “Show Dogs,” landed in sixth place, only digging up $6 million from 3,212 locations. The family-friendly comedy garnered an A CinemaScore. Its Rotten Tomatoes critical score didn’t fare quite as well, averaging a 26 percent. Rounding out the top five are two film’s sophomore frames. Warner Bros.′ “Life of the Party” rallied in $7.5 million from 3,656 locations. Domestically, it has made $30.9 million. Universal’s “Breaking In” secured $6.5 million on 2,537 screens. In two weeks, it’s earned $28.8 million. In the specialty market, Focus Features’ “Pope Francis - A Man of His Word” opened with $480,000 on 346 screens for a per-screen average of $1,389. “RBG,” the documentary on Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, is still holding strong. In its third weekend, it expanded to 375 locations for a three-day total of $1.28 million. That’s a per screen average of $3,413. Magnolia Pictures and Participant Media co-produced the film with Storyville Films and CNN Films. Thanks to a trio of superhero powerhouses, the domestic box office is up 6.3 percent from 2017, according to comScore. The weekend-to-date is up a staggering 62.9 percent, compared to 2017 when “Alien: Covenant” was the No. 1 film. “A crowded powerhouse of a mid-May weekend benefitted from a very diverse lineup of newcomers to appeal to almost every taste and demographic,” Paul Dergarabedian, box office analysis at comScore, said.",office,is,comScore

"You probably wouldn’t put the Apple Watch in the same category as a PlayStation 4, but one of the world’s most beloved video game publishers is going to try. Square Enix, the company behind franchises like “Final Fantasy” and “Dragon Quest,” announced Thursday that it is developing a new role-playing game for the Apple Watch. It’s called “Cosmos Rings” and it’s expected to release in Japan this summer. The company says it’s the “world’s first” RPG made fully for the Apple Watch. That’s arguable: There have been other RPGs that run on the device, like “Watch Quest!” and “Runeblade,” but “Cosmos Rings” could be the first that doesn’t require an iPhone. Apple introduced Apple Watch-native apps with watchOS 2 last fall. The Apple Watch screen is dinky compared to the iPhone ― let alone a television ― but the move makes more sense than you’d think. According to recent analysis, the Apple Watch, an iPhone-connected accessory launched by the tech giant last year, is a $10 billion business. “Apple isn’t walking or jogging but sprinting ahead with Apple Watch,” Neil Cybart, an Apple analyst who runs the Above Avalon blog, wrote in a post last month. Square Enix has also been keen on expanding its mobile gaming options. The company has released iOS and Android versions of classic games like “Final Fantasy VII,” “Secret of Mana” and “Dragon Quest III,” in addition to smartphone-only entries like “Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius.”  Mobile gaming is expected to generate $35 billion in revenue this year, according to an analysis from Deloitte. That’s more than “traditional” PC gaming and console gaming, though mobile gaming is also much more competitive ― the average smartphone game makes a lot less money than PC or console games, that same analysis said. As for the amount of money an Apple Watch RPG can make ― we’ll just have to see. H/T TechnoBuffalo",company,released,Fantasy
"Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg on Friday pilloried Fox News host Laura Ingraham, declining to accept her apology after she mocked him for getting rejected from several colleges ― one of several right-wing attacks against the student activists of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. “She’s only apologizing after a third of her advertisers pulled out, and I think it’s really disgusting, the fact that she basically tried promoting her show after apologizing to me,” Hogg, 17, said on CNN’s “New Day.” “If she really wants to do something, she could cover inner-city violence and the real issues that we have in America.” On Wednesday night, Hogg called on his Twitter followers to pressure advertisers to cut ties with Ingraham’s TV and radio shows. By Friday evening, at least 14 companies had announced they were pulling their ads or had otherwise sought to distance themselves from Ingraham: Nutrish TripAdvisor Wayfair Expedia Nestlé Johnson & Johnson Stitch Fix Hulu Jos. A. Bank Office Depot Jenny Craig Miracle-Ear Liberty Mutual Principal Some of the companies did not specify whether their decision was directly tied to Ingraham’s comments. But a number of them did criticize the host’s remarks. “As a company, we support open dialogue and debate on issues,” a spokeswoman for the home goods retailer Wayfair said. “However, the decision of an adult to personally criticize a high school student who has lost his classmates in an unspeakable tragedy is not consistent with our values.” Ingraham apologized Thursday afternoon, attributing her apology to “reflection, in the spirit of Holy Week.” She also invited Hogg to appear on her show “anytime for a productive discussion.” ""I think it's great that corporate America is standing with me,"" David Hogg says of his call for advertisers to boycott Laura Ingraham's Fox News show, ""They cannot push us around, especially when all we're trying to do here is save lives"" https://t.co/kL7RrM6fHF pic.twitter.com/yvz1PpXMxg “We will no longer advertise with The Laura Ingraham Show moving forward,” a representative for Office Depot told HuffPost on Friday. A representative for Duracell, meanwhile, said the company “does not comment on media buys and placements.” A spokesman for Jos. A. Bank told HuffPost the company did not specifically have ad spending on Ingraham’s Fox News show, “The Ingraham Angle.” Ads that aired on Wednesday night were likely “bonus ads” from the network. Principal told HuffPost, “We are distancing ourselves by removing our advertising from ‘The Ingraham Angle’ show at this time.” Also on Friday, Hogg praised “corporate America” for “standing with me and the rest of my friends,” and accused Ingraham of creating a distraction. “It is important that we stand together as corporate and civic America and show them that they cannot push us around, especially when all we’re trying to do here is save lives,” he said. “And when people try to distract, like what Laura is trying to do right now, from what the real issue is, which is gun violence in America, it’s not only sad, it’s just wrong.” “I am not the issue here,” Hogg went on. “The issue is gun violence in America, but she is trying to distract from that, and I hate it.” Hogg also told CNN that he may take a gap year in order to continue his activism through the midterm elections and work with candidates who support gun control measures. Other than her apology on Twitter, Ingraham did not address the matter Thursday evening on her Fox News show. A representative for the network declined to comment beyond Ingraham’s apology.

"A major Christian news outlet is denouncing Donald Trump in the wake of a video’s release in which the Republican presidential nominee boasted about groping women. Christianity Today, a leading evangelical magazine, published an editorial on Monday denouncing Trump and criticizing Christians for supporting a man’s whose life has been marked by “idolatry, greed, and sexual immorality.” “The revelations of the past week of his vile and crude boasting about sexual conquest — indeed, sexual assault — might have been shocking, but they should have surprised no one,” wrote editorial director Andy Crouch, referring to the release of a 2005 “Access Hollywood” audio recording. In the recording, Trump claimed he tried to have sex with a married woman and boasted he can grab women “by the pussy” because he is a celebrity. Trump was already married to his current wife, Melania, who was likely pregnant at the time of the recording. Crouch referred to Trump as an “idolater” for indulging in “sexual immorality” and attacked him for repeatedly failing to repent for his actions. He also accused Trump’s Christian supporters of looking past the Republican nominee’s moral failings at the expense of their religious integrity. “Enthusiasm for a candidate like Trump gives our neighbors ample reason to doubt that we believe Jesus is Lord,” wrote the Christianity Today editor. “They see that some of us are so self-interested, and so self-protective, that we will ally ourselves with someone who violates all that is sacred to us.” Nearly two-thirds of white evangelical voters in the U.S. are standing behind Trump, even after the video’s release. But that percentage has declined significantly in recent months ― and it may continue plummeting as more Christians, evangelicals and Republicans speak out against their once-revered candidate. Megachurch pastor James MacDonald, a member of Trump’s own evangelical advisory council, sent an email to others in the group over the weekend calling the Republican nominee “lecherous and worthless.” MacDonald, like many others, didn’t accept Trump’s excuse that his comments in the 2005 video were nothing but “locker room talk.” On Sunday, prominent evangelical theologian and former Trump-supporter Wayne Grudem published a column condemning the nominee’s “moral character” and urging him to withdraw from the election. Trump also lost support from his Mormon base over the weekend, as several Mormon Republican officials pulled their endorsements. Deseret News, a media outlet owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, published an editorial on Saturday calling on Trump to step down.  “In democratic elections,” the outlet’s editors wrote, “ideas have consequences, leadership matters and character counts.” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly

"The head of programming at HBO says that the network has examined all of its shows and corrected gender pay disparities among staff, inspired by “Big Little Lies” star and producer Reese Witherspoon and the larger Time’s Up movement. “One of the things that’s come out of thinking about the movement and some conversations with Reese, who’s really at the forefront, is something we’ve done recently,” Casey Bloys, HBO’s president of programming, told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview published Monday. “We’ve proactively gone through all of our shows — in fact, we just finished our process where we went through and made sure that there were no inappropriate disparities in pay; and where there were, if we found any, we corrected it going forward.”  Bloys would not elaborate on which of the network’s shows required adjusting pay. A spokesman for HBO declined to comment further. Witherspoon’s representative did not respond to a request for comment. Other popular shows and networks have had to address similar pay gaps. Netflix’s “The Crown” generated controversy when producers admitted that actress Claire Foy was paid less than male costar Matt Smith, despite Foy playing the central character.  Bloys said that pay would be commensurate with experience but that the network sought to eliminate “wildly disparate” pay, especially when a show is successful. “When you’re putting a show together, people come in with different levels of experience and maybe some people have won awards or something that makes them stand out,” he said. “But when you get into season two or three of a show and the show is a success, it is much harder to justify paying people wildly disparate numbers.” Witherspoon has been an outspoken leader of Hollywood’s Time’s Up movement, which established a legal defense fund to assist women across all industries facing sexual harassment and other gender-related workplace injustices. The popularity and critical acclaim of “Big Little Lies” last year, which Witherspoon and costar Nicole Kidman helped bring to HBO, marked a watershed moment for shows created by and about women. Originally slated as a limited series, the show’s second season will air in 2019.",he,said,awards
"I’ll be the first to admit that “intersectionality” is not a great term – more jargon than rallying cry, it doesn’t exactly slip off the tongue – but as a 21st century Jewish feminist, I also embrace it as a powerful framework for the complexity of identity and politics. Recent events – such as last Saturday’s exclusion from the Chicago Dyke March of a Jewish lesbian carrying a rainbow flag with a Star of David, or Linda Sarsour’s challenge last March to the compatibility of feminism and support for Israel– have been held up by some American Jews and others as examples of intersectionality’s failure. I see them, instead, as proof of how deeply we need intersectionality and how seriously misunderstood the concept remains. The term “intersectionality” was first coined in 1989 by legal scholar Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw to describe how the overlapping of multiple identities complicates the experience of discrimination. Her initial focus was black women, whose experiences are not fully described by considering those of black men and white women. This idea has significant implications for social justice movements, reminding them that if they do not think broadly and holistically about the interplay of multiple identities, these movements cannot succeed. The further implication of intersectionality is that while we all hold many different identities, they are, of course, not all marginalized identities. One might, for example, be black and wealthy; or male and gay; or female and white. So while a key goal of intersectionality is to fight for the visibility and inclusion of the multiply marginalized, it has also brought to light the complexity of having identities that combine elements of oppression and of privilege.   There’s no doubt that holding this complexity isn’t easy or comfortable, as Jews in the modern world know well. (Are we privileged or oppressed? I would argue both.) And so, unfortunately, intersectionality has suffered from some serious slippage, from a call for greater complexity of analysis to a call for ideological alignment. Because, let’s face it, it’s much easier to demand a neat reckoning of oppressed vs. oppressor, us vs. them, than it is to admit that it’s almost always more complicated than that—and we may even be implicated. But here’s the thing: intersectionality is not about enforcing alignment of identities and politics. In fact, by definition, “intersectionality” is the opposite of alignment! Intersecting lines touch at only one point; everywhere else, they are heading in different directions. The purpose of intersectionality is to help us all realize that identities are complex and diverse and multi-faceted; that we can’t create simple equations to explain, describe, or prescribe them. This misunderstanding of intersectionality is deployed by its supporters and detractors alike – by those, like the organizers of the Chicago Dyke March, who insist that an LGBTQ march must necessarily be pro-Palestinian and anti-Zionist, and by those, like Bari Weiss of the New York Times, who warn us that intersectionality by definition is bad for the Jews. You have to choose, they all seem to say: either get on board with a neat version of intersectionality and pare down those messy identities, or reject intersectionality out of hand. As always, when we are being asked to choose, I believe we must ask ourselves why. Who benefits from this framing of the conversation? Choices are almost never neutral and unweighted; instead, they cloak deep structural power relations in the language of freedom. A world without intersectional analysis is a world in which we can’t see the big picture, and a world in which we’re forced to amputate parts of our identities is a world in which we cannot be our authentic selves. Neither is a world in which I want to live. As a historian, I am keenly aware that social movements have often come undone over the attempt to enforce rigid ideological alignments. Movements such as socialism and feminism have fractured again and again over ever-narrower definitions of the true cause of oppression. Similarly, the “my oppression is greater than your oppression” game doesn’t benefit anyone or anything but the status quo. In this historical moment, we do not have the luxury of splintering in pursuit of ideological purity. If we’re going to survive the current administration and its threats to multiple communities (not to mention the planet and the entire human race), we’re going to need to learn how to build coalitions and hold the complexity that comes along with that. We’re going to be triggered sometimes by finding ourselves sharing space with people and ideas that challenge our worldviews. We’re going to have to figure out how to make that experience productive, not destructive. My own commitment to social justice is rooted in both Judaism and feminism, and both have taught me to ask the hard questions and to believe in the possibility of change. Intersectionality is a process, and a challenging one at that. We have a long way to go but I believe that we can reclaim its original meaning and practice it more effectively. Frankly, this white American Jewish feminist progressive Zionist sees no alternative.",Movements,fractured,oppression
"I get a kick out of spotting invisible threads that connect disparate theories and lines of research.  Sometimes I'll even notice a pattern (after the fact) in my own essays about different topics -- which can be gratifying until I realize that the common denominator is embarrassingly simple. One observation I've offered in various contexts is that ""how much"" tends to matter less than ""what kind.""  That's something I've written about in four very different domains.  My only defense against the reply ""Well, duh.  Who says otherwise?"" is: ""No one says otherwise, but most of us tend to act as if it weren't true.""  Let me explain. 1.  Motivation.  After I published a thick book about the damaging effects of rewards, I realized that a lot of the research I had cited could be summarized in a few straightforward sentences:  Without really thinking about it, we tend to assume there's something called ""motivation"" - a single entity of which someone can have a lot or a little.  When we deal with people who have less power than we do, we're often tempted to offer them rewards for acting the way we want because we figure this will increase their level of motivation to do so. If we ignore the moral implications of treating others this way, rewarding them might be justified in practical terms. . . . that is, if the underlying model of motivation were accurate.  Unfortunately, it isn't.  In reality, there are qualitatively different kinds of motivation, and the kind is more important than the amount.  What matters is whether one is intrinsically motivated to engage in an activity (which means one finds it valuable or satisfying in its own right) or extrinsically motivated (which means that doing it produces a result outside of the task, such as a reward). Even impressive levels of extrinsic motivation don't bode well for meaningful goals.  In fact, as scores of studies have shown, rewards tend to reduce people's intrinsic motivation.  You get a prize for reading a book (or for being helpful) and you tend to find reading (or helpfulness) itself less appealing in the future.  Thus, what matters isn't how motivated someone is, but how someone is motivated.  The common but mistaken assumption that motivation comes in only one flavor helps to explain why rewards remain popular despite all the harm they do. Many teachers, I find, are familiar with the modifiers ""intrinsic"" and ""extrinsic,"" yet they continue to talk about ""how motivated"" a student is or how to ""motivate"" kids in general.  By overlooking the critical difference between types of motivation, they contribute to a serious problem.  Only extrinsic motivation can be increased from the outside, so that's what schools focus on (with grades, points, awards, praise, and the like) -- often at the expense of children's interest in learning.  2.  Love.  Let's consider a very different example of the same general principle.  Many of us who are parents take comfort from the idea that what kids really need -- maybe all they need -- is our love.  The implication is that love is a substance we can supply in greater or lesser quantities -- greater, of course, being preferable.   But again, this assumption turns out to be fatally simplistic since there are actually different ways of loving a child, and these ways aren't equally desirable.  The psychoanalyst Alice Miller observed that it's possible to love a child ""passionately - but not in the way he needs to be loved.""  If she's right, the relevant question isn't just whether, or even how much, we love our kids.  It also matters how we love them.  Once that's understood, we could pretty quickly come up with a list of different types of parental love along with opinions about which are better.   I tend to focus on the distinction between loving kids for what they do and loving them for who they are.  The first kind is conditional, which means children must earn our acceptance -- by acting in ways we deem appropriate or performing up to our standards.  The second kind of love is unconditional:  It doesn't hinge on how they act, whether they're successful or well-behaved or anything else.  And it's the latter, according to a growing body of research, that children really need -- from their parents and even from their teachers.  Unfortunately, it's also the opposite of what most parenting and classroom management resources are selling.  Positive reinforcement for good behavior, just like ""time out"" for bad behavior, exemplifies conditional acceptance. 3.  Self-esteem.  Conservatives have been sneering at what they call the ""self-esteem movement"" for decades, but considerable research confirms that how people regard themselves is indeed a powerful predictor of various psychological outcomes -- and that higher self-esteem is better than lower.  Over the last few years, however, a number of psychologists have shown that what matters about self-esteem isn't just how much of it one has but how stable it is.  If your confidence in yourself is fragile, the result may be anger or depression.  And even if your self-esteem is generally high, you may struggle with self-doubt or become defensive if that positive view isn't sufficiently secure. The crucial determinant of stability, in turn, seems to be unconditionality.  A solid core of belief in yourself, an abiding sense that you're competent and worthwhile -- even when you screw up or fall short -- creates a more reliable (and healthier) form of self-esteem.  Conversely, if you think well of yourself only to the extent that you're successful or attractive or appreciated by others -- if you regard self-esteem as something that's perpetually in doubt -- then you're in for trouble, psychologically speaking.  Low self-esteem (""I don't feel very good about myself"") is bad enough; self-esteem that's contingent (""I feel good about myself only when..."") is even more worrisome.[1] It's a neat parallel:  The level of esteem one has for oneself, just like the amount of love children receive from their parents, doesn't tell the whole story.  Actually, it's more than a parallel because these lines intersect.  Being accepted unconditionally is what allows children to accept themselves unconditionally.  Or to put it the other way around, conditional acceptance predicts conditional self-acceptance -- and poorer psychological health. 4.  Internalization.  Many people with an interest in child development -- even if they're aware of the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation -- like to say that kids should be helped to internalize good values or behaviors.  But how exactly does that process play out?  On the one hand, kids may swallow whole (or ""introject"") an adult's rule or standard so that it seems to control them from the inside: They do what they've been told because they'll feel guilty if they don't.  On the other hand, internalization can happen more authentically, so the behavior has been fully integrated into their value structure.  It feels chosen.[2] In short, internalization can take place in very different ways.  Which means, once again, that what counts isn't just whether (or the extent to which) kids are doing it, but how.   When adults control children, they end up promoting an introjected style that often results in learning that's rigid, superficial, and ultimately less successful.  Many older students have very effectively internalized a compulsion to do well in school.  On the outside they look like admirably dedicated students, but they may have mortgaged their present lives to the future: noses to the grindstone, perseverant to a fault, stressed to the max.  High school is just preparation for college, college is just an occasion for collecting credentials for whatever comes next.  Such students may be skilled test-takers and grade grubbers and gratification delayers, but they're often motivated by a perpetual need to feel better about themselves rather than by anything resembling curiosity.  True, these students no longer require carrots or sticks.  They don't need discipline because they're self-disciplined. . . to a fault.  Their motivation is internal but it sure as hell isn't intrinsic.  And that key distinction would go unnoticed if we had just asked whether they had internalized certain values rather than inquired about the nature of that internalization. * If we know better, why do so many of us act as if things like love, motivation, self-esteem, and internalization come in only one variety?  Might we focus on how much of ""it"" someone has because of our culture's preoccupation with quantification and data?[3]  Or is it just that we've never been invited to consider the practical ramifications of the fact that none of these concepts is actually unitary? NOTES 1.  For an extended discussion of this point and the supporting research, see chapter 6 (""The Attack on Self-Esteem"") of my book The Myth of the Spoiled Child . 2.  I rely here on the theory and research of Edward Deci, Richard Ryan, and their many colleagues and former students.  For a list of publications on this topic, see http://ow.ly/4n12A9.   3.  In all four examples I've offered here, my argument is that it's not enough to ask ""How much?"" because the more meaningful question is ""What kind?""  But some practices may be inherently problematic, such that even the latter question takes too much for granted.  In such cases, the more pertinent question is ""Should we be doing this at all?""  One example that comes to mind is homework, the practice of making students work what amounts to a second shift when they get home from school.",whatever,is,credentials

 Czech writer Milan Kundera poses in a garden in Prague in 1973. (AFP/AFP/Getty Images)  What do we make of a bad book, written late-career, by an acclaimed author?  With a whiff of schadenfreude, some revel in the literary hero’s fall from grace. Others avert their eyes, saddened that a great artist failed to move them as he or she once did. In either case, the book is more than a book. It has become intertwined with the writer’s cultural legacy and personal history. Milan Kundera’s new novel, The Festival of Insignificance, is one of these late-career bad books. With a startling relish, writers from The New York Times and The Guardian have denounced the slim hundred-pager as out-of-touch, sexist, and, worst of all, banal. Praise, when it comes, remains glancing. A New Republic piece calls it “more bagatelle than concerto, more ramble through the park than expedition to scale lofty peaks,” while an LA Times review recommends we read the book as mere “epilogue.”  In a sense, they’re right. The Festival of Insignificance is a far cry from Kundera’s classic The Unbearable Lightness of Being, which combined lyrical excellence and philosophical weight to great effect in 1984. The new book, on the other hand, tracks five trifling characters as they play pranks, tell anecdotes about Stalin, and ruminate on navels. When a failed actor speaks ""Pakistani"" to feed his performance bug, the ploy strikes as quirky rather than profound. “Insignificance, my friend, is the essence of existence,” summarizes a character at the book’s end.  For fiction, it’s a thesis told in too few words. Yet there’s good reason to ponder Kundera’s book. Not destined to be a masterpiece, it nevertheless remains ripe for a different sort of analysis: one that fits the “bagatelle” into Kundera’s literary narrative, recognizing that an “epilogue” cannot be understood without the preceding text. His, after all, is a knotted history. It began with the ardently anti-communist The Joke in 1967, shed its political bent after The Unbearable Lightness of Being, then switched languages from Czech to French after 1990 -- a decade after Kundera had emigrated to France.   If a shallow late-novel recalls and complicates those decades of depth, is it really so shallow? It’s disappointing that so few of the reviews have dug into the philosophical meat of The Festival of Insignificance -- because it diverges so drastically from earlier Kundera works. Compare, for instance, its title with that of The Unbearable Lightness of Being. The 1984 classic tracked the motifs of lightness and heaviness, complicating the assumption that heavy things -- tragedies, heartache, angst -- were negative. Heaviness was painful, yes, but it also lent meaning to existence. It’s difficult to lapse into nihilism when there are pressing issues like political catastrophe to attend to. Lightness, the characters found out, was the truly awful condition. Though it seemed attractive to float serenely through the world without care, ease turned quickly to apathy, then became unbearable.  Then we have The Festival of Insignificance: a complete embrace of the lightness Kundera once seemed to reject. Life, the new characters contend, is insignificant, so we might as well make it a spectacle. Instead of forging meaning through layered memories, relationships, and objects, these Parisians find solace in what Hegel called “unendliche Wohlgemutheit” -- an infinite good mood in which even the worst atrocities seem hilarious.  Back in The Joke, humor was no laughing matter. When the protagonist quips wittily, “Optimism is the opium of the people,” he spells his doom in a repressive communist regime. But fast forward 50 years in Kundera’s oeuvre, and the stakes are reversed. In the latest book, Stalin becomes the excuse for a joke about urination; instead of leaving us vulnerable to totalitarianism, laughter dances above it. These are fascinating departures, almost complete reversals. Why, we must ask, has a novelist of ideas so radically changed his own? Perhaps it is a question of nationality. Did Kundera discover lightness when he left behind his homeland, opting for the very life of garden strolls and party antics that consume the insufferable Parisians in the new novel? When Kundera rejected his Czech heritage -- asking that all his works be reclassified as French Literature -- was he breaking with his homeland’s political gravitas? Or perhaps it is a matter of age. Has Kundera arrived -- after a lifetime of grappling with heaviness, identity, and meaning -- at the conclusion that insignificance is our best foundation for life? “We’ve known for a long time that it was no longer possible to overturn this world, nor reshape it, nor head off its dangerous headlong rush,” ruminates one of the characters in The Festival of Insignificance, “There’s been only one possible resistance: to not take it seriously.” Time can breed cynicism, and Kundera seems to have arrived at humor as the only option in a jaded world.   These modes of reading are a far cry from normal review protocol, which tends to judge each book on its own, isolated terms. But Kundera’s late novel cannot help but drum up associations with the past 50 years. Readers and critics will inevitably contextualize it with political and personal details, and that’s not necessarily a problem. In a recent NPR piece, Saeed Jones explored the question of how to view Toni Morrison’s Gold Help the Children, a late-career novel much like Kundera’s. Morrison’s new work is similarly sparse and pared down -- as if she’s withholding the full, thundering force that captivated readers in Beloved or Paradise. Yet, Jones points out, the book still means volumes to us. It interlocks with the thematics of beauty, slavery, and mother-daughter relations Morrison has spent a life-time exploring -- so each passage calls up layers of symbolic meaning. An image that would flow quickly from our minds if penned by another author is instead captured and savored because we have a Morrison foundation to receive it.  The Festival of Insignificance operates in a similar vein. Its lightness is heavy with the weight of previous Kundera books, so a Stalin reference blooms with additional meaning -- because it’s been set so strikingly against previous portrayals of communism. This is a very different model for thinking of literature; it rests less on the individual merit of a book and more on how it connects to a broader network of meaning. Academics sometimes call this “intertextuality”: examining the relationships between texts, delving into the network’s depth. If that seems to be letting authors off too easily -- letting them sit on their laurels and produce paltry works -- we would do well to revisit The Unbearable Lightness of Being. One of the novel’s central preoccupations, after all, is the formation of meaning through layered memories:   ""Each time the same object would give rise to a new meaning, though all former meanings would resonate (like an echo, like a parade of echoes) together with the new one. Each new experience would resound, each time enriching the harmony."" If we take Kundera to be the object, even a banal “new experience” will summon all those old echoes. The harmony resounds just a bit more richly, and The Festival of Insignificance becomes a parade of echoes. It’s a perfect metaphor for reading novels of this sort -- and a fact Kundera seems to have known all along. In a few weeks, Harper Lee will release Go Set a Watchman, a book that will inevitably fail to live up to its predecessor but that need not be written off. Broadening our mindset -- fitting the novel into a larger textual legacy -- may not redeem it. But that mindset can, at least, provide a stimulating exercise, a more productive and respectful way to think about the late works of the greats.  For then they will become, like the reunion of two lovers in Kundera’s famed novel, “a recapitulation of time, a hymn to their common past, a sentimental summary of an unsentimental story that was disappearing in the distance.”",atrocities,find,which
" no more tests by timlewisnm via Creative Commons BY-SA 2.0 ""What's the best way to evaluate a teacher?"" The question, asked of me by one of the members of the National Teacher of the Year interview panel, was one I've been thinking about for a while. ""I'll answer that by telling you a story,"" I said. Stories are how I make sense of anything. Partly because I'm just no good at remembering statistics and academic sources under pressure. Partly because I come from a clan of people who illustrate everything with a story. My first year to teach Advanced Placement English was also my first year to feel completely successful as a teacher, if success meant getting perfect test scores. All of the AP students passed the test for graduation; half of them received academic recognition - meaning they answered all of the questions right and wrote high-scoring essays. ""I am a master teacher - be me,"" I joked to my colleagues. But down deep, I nurtured an almost electric thrill at meeting this marker of ""objective"" teaching success. I wanted to believe my own joke. Rattling around somewhere in that little raisin-sized conscience of mine, I knew the truth: I hadn't given much to those kids that they didn't already have. Sure, I taught them how to finesse a few things in their writing, how to do some closer reading of texts. But really, they would've scored almost as well with a substitute teacher. Because that really happened one year at my school. The ""permanent substitute,"" (one of my favorite education oxymorons), who took over a class for almost the entire school year, had better scores than veteran teachers. He had no classroom management; his class looked like a modern version of ""Blackboard Jungle."" And yet, ""his"" scores were not the worst in the department. Which brings me round to another part of my story. That first year for AP was also my first year to teach two classes of refugee students. And they took the same graduation test as my AP students. Spoiler alert: no one passed. ""I'm the worst teacher in the world,"" I thought. ""I should be fired."" Because once you factored in my ESL students' scores, my 100 percent perfect average became 50 percent, making me - officially - the worst teacher on my campus. And so I put to you the same questions I used to end my story at the interview: ""Which is the truth? Was I the worst teacher? Or the best teacher? And upon what criteria are you basing your answer?"" And that, dear reader, is the same spot we find ourselves in wherever teachers are judged solely on test scores. I'm not even good at math, but here's my statistical probability prediction: Where, what, and who you teach will show similar patterns of ""successful"" and ""failing"" schools and teachers across your district. Any district. And yes, please test me on that.",year,was,students
"If Simon is going down, he’s going down swinging. “Walking Dead” fans lost their new favorite character this week after Simon’s (Steven Ogg) plans to usurp Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) were sniffed out by the big man himself. Negan basically went “Game of Thrones” on Simon, sentencing him to trial by one-on-one combat. Since Negan has nearly indestructible plot armor, you knew it wasn’t ending well for his second-in-command. In a scene that’s incredibly hard to watch, Negan ends up strangling Simon to death, but not before our dude managed to sneak in a few good shots on his boss. During an interview with HuffPost on his exit, actor Ogg also threw some punches at the sometimes-toxic fan culture surrounding the show. A number of “Walking Dead” actors have been the subjects of disturbing online bullying. Josh McDermitt, the actor who plays Eugene, left social media after receiving death threats due to his character’s “evil” turn in the show. Alanna Masterson, aka Tara on the show, experienced a barrage of body-shaming comments on Instagram after she appeared in the Season 7 episode “Swear” shortly after giving birth. Two years later, she’s still asking people to “please” stop harassing her. A post shared by Alanna (@alannamasterson) on Mar 31, 2018 at 1:13pm PDT When it comes to the trolls, Ogg isn’t so cordial. “It makes me fucking sick,” he told HuffPost. “It’s just disgusting.” Ogg said he’s seen firsthand what social media can do to a person, and he’s tired of it. “It makes me sick that these trolls and these people can say stuff, because, again, the social anonymity of it is what allows people somehow the right to just say whatever the fuck they want,” he said. “And you know what? If you want to fucking beak off like that, then why don’t you post your name — your full name, not your Twitter name, not your handle, not your bullshit, whatever made-up stuff you do. Print your real name. Print your real phone number. Print your real address. Step up. Don’t just hide behind this anonymity and say whatever you want. That shit pisses me off. ” “I’ve had personal experiences, and I’ve been through stuff,” Ogg added. “But again, it does affect you, but you have to quickly go, it’s bottom feeders, right? It’s catfish. It’s people that are eating the fucking shit out of the hippo tank, and that’s how you’re spending your time? It’s sad.” The actor explains a “better man” would just say, “Oh, it’s sad. These people are just pathetic,” but sometimes he can’t help getting upset. “That’s why Alanna’s post was so beautiful, because fuck off. Why are you harassing people?” he said. “Go fucking do something productive with your life.” Ogg noted that he has a “love and hate” relationship with social media overall. (We’re probably safe assuming it’s more of the latter.) He does run his Instagram account, but he says he left Facebook after the 2016 presidential election and only “dabbles” on Twitter. According to him, he has “enough shit” going on in his head without online comments further polluting it. Ogg recently saw his co-star McDermitt perform in a play in New York and remarked on how different he is since he left social media. “He’s happier and in a better place than ever now,” Ogg said, adding that “his energy, and I made the point of saying this to him, is different.” Now, as clear-cut as Simon’s strangling was, “Walking Dead” actors never really die. Sure, they can be snuffed out on the show, but with Comic-Cons and other fan events, actors are constantly called back to make appearances and greeted by masses of fans bigger than any zombie herd. Ogg will likely be hearing from “Walking Dead” fans, on- and offline, for some time. Which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. When there’s respect, Ogg said the fandom can be a deeply rewarding experience: There’s people that haven’t left their home in five months or that have anxiety attacks or depression, and you talk to them. Shit, I have super crazy anxiety. I get super depressed, and we’re all human. Man, woman, transgender, black, white, whatever all these fucking labels are we got flying around. You punch anyone in the nose, and we’re all gonna bleed, so people are at these [events], man, I wanna share what I have to share. I’m not better than you because I’m on the show. I’m just lucky in a sense, and I work at my job, and I got this but, man, you connect with people. It’s an emotional experience, and you realize that you can make a difference to people, so how beautiful is that? And they make a difference to me, these people saying, ‘This is the best day of my life.’ OK, I don’t have to understand that any more than I have to understand why someone paints their fucking face for a sports event, but it doesn’t mean that I don’t appreciate what they have to offer. But when there isn’t respect, well, Ogg’s got two words for you: “Fuck off.”",he,saw,media
"Thirty-five years ago today, Michael Jackson took the stage and made an indelible impact on pop culture with his solo performance on “Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever,” a televised celebration of the famous label’s creation. The May 16, 1983 broadcast was produced and directed by Don Mischer, who has helped orchestrate other historic moments over the years, including the opening ceremony for the 1996 Olympic Games, where Muhammad Ali made a surprise appearance; Prince’s iconic 2007 “Purple Rain” Super Bowl halftime show; and many Oscar ceremonies (not, thankfully for him, 2017’s Envelopegate). Mischer spoke to Yahoo Entertainment about working with Jackson and having a front-row seat to one of the most exciting and innovative performances of all time. Since Motown 25 was intended to showcase the label’s greatest hits, Mischer and executive producer Suzanne de Passe initially banned every artist (from Marvin Gaye to the Temptations to Diana Ross) from performing new material. Jackson pushed back, wanting to perform a solo song called “Billie Jean.” Mischer recalls the tense moment: “Look, if we let Michael do a new song, who’s going to take the phone call from Marvin Gaye on Monday saying, ‘Why did you let Michael do a new song and I couldn’t do a new song?’” But that delicate game of politics was upended when Mischer witnessed Jackson’s rehearsal for his “Billie Jean” performance. “I think Linda Ronstadt was there, Smokey Robinson was there, Diana Ross was there, but the place was empty basically,” Mischer said. “So we watched ‘Billie Jean’ for the first time, the whole thing, the hat, the socks, the moonwalk — after that was over, we just knew this was incredibly special.” Mischer and de Passe ended up letting Jackson perform “Billie Jean,” with Mischer volunteering to take the call from a presumably ticked-off Marvin Gaye on Monday. For those not alive in 1983 or who may misremember the performance, Jackson’s actual moonwalk was surprisingly brief: It lasted only two and a half seconds. There are a few yelps of approval from the fans in the audience, but that moment in itself didn’t bring down the house. Like most myths, it has evolved exponentially over the years. A couple of weeks later, Mischer began to edit the concert together. Jackson visited him to decide on what shots of his performance he wanted. “He had very clear creative ideas about what he wanted and how he wanted to see himself portrayed,” said Mischer. “There were times we disagreed about a shot or something, but I always deferred to him … I trusted his judgment.” But while Jackson might have been an outsized presence onstage, he was the exact opposite in Mischer’s editing bay. “He was always quiet … he was a very quiet, shy human being,” Mischer said. “He would come into a room and just go into a corner. He would whisper to people. [But] when he got onstage, he was like a general.” Ultimately, Jackson was happy with “Motown 25.” Mischer says that after it aired, he got a signed photo saying “Thanks for the magic moment.” And the rest of the country shared in that sentiment. Mischer says that days later, he was at the White House to film a Barbara Walters interview with Nancy Reagan. As he recalls, “Coming down the elevator [of the hotel], everybody’s talking about Michael. In the taxicab going to the White House, everybody was talking about Michael. In the East Wing [of the White House] … everybody’s talking about Motown 25 and Michael.”He continued, “We do these kinds of things and we never know how people are going to react, but that morning in Washington … suddenly I said to myself, ‘This show really had an incredible impact.’” Read more from Yahoo Entertainment: This post was originally published on Yahoo Entertainment.",show,continued,impact
"It was in late August 2015 when I found out that Visualise had won the Doctors Without Borders (MSF) Forced From Home project. Our brief: condense a number of complex geopolitical issues into a series of emotive and empathetic VR films shot in some of the most remote and difficult places on Earth. I remember feeling a mixture of excitement and dread. We would be embarking on a globe spanning VR project about the refugee crisis, and it was my responsibility to direct it, but what excited me was the opportunity to prove that VR can connect people even in the most distant of places.  Even at the best of times, shooting VR films is challenging. VR really benefits from carefully planned shots and total control over the scene, and a refugee camp is essentially the furthest thing from this. People tend to walk up to the camera and inspect it, which is understandable because it looks strange, but this tends to ruin shots. In rural Tanzania, at the Nduta camp for Burundian refugees, a crowd of people 10 deep would circle the camera if we left it rolling for longer than about 2 minutes. To manage this, our audio engineer Henrik Oppermann would distract people by getting the crowd to follow him to his microphone to record some group singing, or to show them our VR headset.  Having a piece of equipment like a 360° camera in your luggage usually warrants extra scrutiny from security. In Iraq, we were at Erbil airport and security had me unpack every single piece of equipment for inspection. I think they were probably a bit bored and were interested in what we had with us. A particular moment which I’ll never forget was when one security guy picked up a compressed air canister, wondering if it was flammable. He took out his lighter and held it to the stream of air. Of course, nothing happened, but had it been something else he would have lit me on fire. Satisfied, he let me take it on the plane.  In Domiz Camp in northern Iraq we were filming a Syrian family from Damascus who had their house destroyed and fled. We spent a few days with the family in their makeshift concrete block home in the camp. What struck me most was how similar they seemed to my own family. After one day of shooting, I brought over my VR headset and showed it to one of their sons, a kid of about 10 years old. He very nervously put on the headset and spent about 20 minutes immersed in the experience. When he came out, he couldn’t stop smiling, and immediately began asking me questions about how the headset worked via our translator. It’s something I would have done as a 10 year old growing up in Canada.  Stepping into a refugee camp for the first time is a daunting experience because you’re confronted with poverty, helplessness, disease. Yet, what you soon realise about the people there is that they’re just like you. They want the same things you do. This was the idea that I tried to convey in Forced from Home. I think if VR can take someone to a place like this and allow them to meet the people affected by these situations, then it will make us more understanding of each other.  I was honoured to have been given the chance to take part in this project and for the chance to push the medium of VR forward.",us,think,other
"The month before standardized tests begin each school year, Stephen Lazar, a National Board-certified history and English teacher at Harvest Collegiate High School in New York City, tells his students that he is going to ""turn into a bad teacher. ... No more research, no more discussion, no more dealing with complexity, no more developing as writers with voice and style."" Instead, they practice mindless repetition of facts so they can perform well on a standardized test that, in its perverse way, Stephen says, ""works.""  But he knows it doesn't really work -- that is, if we want to equip our kids with the skills and knowledge they need to be successful in life, college and career. When Stephen testified before Congress earlier this year, he told lawmakers that top-down, test-based accountability, which ""values three hours of testing over a year of learning and development,"" should be replaced with more valid and useful measures of student achievement.  Stephen is one of thousands of educators, union leaders, parents and students who have called for changes to policies that essentially reduced kids to test scores and teachers to algorithms. AFT members alone took more than 100,000 actions online, submitted 20,000 comments to Congress, and met with numerous congressional leaders and staff. After all these years of test-and-sanction policies, Congress listened and acted.  In a rare display of finding common ground, Congress recently passed the Every Student Succeeds Act by overwhelming majorities. ESSA replaces the broadly discredited No Child Left Behind Act, a law whose test-punish-repeat approach has left students alternately stressed or bored, has frustrated parents and has de-professionalized and demoralized teachers.  Under the newly passed ESSA, high-stakes testing and sanctions are no longer the be-all and end-all in education. States still will administer standardized tests, but they can now limit the consequences of these tests and the time students spend taking them, and eliminate unnecessary or poor-quality tests. States have an explicit obligation to help struggling schools succeed, not simply close them. And they are obliged to build an accountability system grounded in what students need to know and be able to do -- for example, by allowing project-based assessments, which can replace regular state standardized assessments in seven pilot states. ESSA focuses on populations of students who need the most, providing funds that can be used for early childhood programs, class-size reduction and community schools. It maintains high certification requirements for paraprofessionals, and it gets the federal government out of the business of teacher evaluation.  Does this law solve all the problems of public education? No law can. Indeed, just this week researchers recognized (again) the impact of poverty, finding that poor kids start school a year behind wealthier kids.  But this new law can create positive change. States will now take the lead on accountability, interventions and teacher evaluation systems. While some states will mess up, we hope most will learn from the failures of NCLB and give teachers and schools the latitude and support to deeply engage students and to focus on the whole child.   There are other signs the tide is turning. Gov. Andrew Cuomo's Common Core Task Force, on which I served, last week urged a reboot of education policy in New York after its disastrous implementation of the Common Core. The task force calls for the development of new state standards, along with curriculum, tests and training, that focus on kids' unique needs and foster a joy of learning. And it recommends a moratorium on evaluating teachers using students' test scores. Now that the federal law has been overhauled, every state should do what this task force did--diagnose what's working and what's not, and make the necessary fixes. When state officials err, we will still have to fight, as in New Mexico, where educators and union leaders have long called for changes to the state's teacher evaluation system, which is based on a flawed ""value-added"" model. Earlier this month, a judge granted a preliminary injunction that halts the use of this system, calling it a ""Beta test where teachers bear the burden for its uneven and inconsistent application.""  The people closest to our kids have shined a light on harmful education policies and practices. Responsibility now moves to the states, and officials must use this opportunity to get this reset right. I call on them to work with educators, parents, unions and other partners to help bring back the joy of teaching and learning, and to empower teachers to stoke students' curiosity and help them pursue their interests, work in teams, and wrestle with and master concepts. Because wonderful educators like Stephen Lazar should have the resources and latitude not simply to prepare kids to take tests, but to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them.",Congress,listened,policies

I'm not a theorist but of course I want to have a say in the course of history so I'm using what I do in a very literal way. I'm painting portraits of every woman artist I know. It's a simple gesture. I'm painting them so they will not disappear. The almost performative extension of this project has been the many hours I spend hearing each of their different and powerful perspectives.

We each chose a news item from the day we were born to respond to with an artwork. I chose a society piece on a party at the ""Playboy Mansion."" Collaging with contrasting tapes on Miss April 1971 I created something both beautiful and terrible. The image was so absorbing and quarrelsome I was inspired to monumentally remake it. The 6' x 14' image was first painted realistically then troweled over with waxy medium, 90% of the original painting obliterated.

I'm curious to explore our paradoxical relationship to these patriarchal images of beauty and desire, at once seduced and repulsed. Slabs of paint are suffocating violation, protective barrier and teasing veil. These are not linear narratives the way cubist space was not linear. Quantum physicists have proved it but artist have always known it. Particles exist in multiple places at once. Truth is not a fixed point. Artists are the guardians of the freedom to be broken.
Rebecca Campbell, Candy Darling, 2015, oil on canvas, 60"" x 60"" As women demand equity there is sometimes a call to circle the wagons. This is practical for survival mode.

- Michelle Obama, Tuskegee University Commencement Address, May 2015 The following comments below are responses from my discussion with successful, young Black colleagues in the opera profession in May 2015. ""I did walk on stage in a competition once, while audibly hearing a shocked audience member mention ""Ein Schwarze..."" (German for ""A Black"") ""Once in Italy, I had to walk to my hotel and it was a hump. It was a small town and everyone knew I was not from there. I only saw two other Black people there. My Italian was pretty new so I didn't understand everything. On my walk, men constantly were stopping and asking me if I needed a ride. I said, ""No thank you,"" and kept walking. Finally on a long walk to the grocery store a very old man offered and I said to myself, ""I can take him on if he acts like a fool."" I kept my hand on the door to jump and roll if necessary. It wasn't. He took me to the store and when I offered my hand to shake his and thank him, he grabbed my breast and smiled. I was shocked and got out the car.(I was young and stupid, I know). I told my cast-mates what happened. I had been telling them all along how nice everyone in the town was always for offering me rides.  Once I told them of this incident they finally told me it was not niceness. Black women were thought to be prostitutes and they were trying to pick me up.  From that point on, the tenor offered to drive me home at night."" ""...in Europe... the director said he couldn't have two Black singers cast in a production he was directing because the direction and flavor of the show would change."" ""While walking the streets of Paris midday with my family, my sister and I passed a
woman who intentionally put her leg out to forcefully kick my sister (who was wearing
her hair in an afro at the time) and cursed at her using racially-charged language."" ""Once in Europe with a mostly French cast, a cast-mate's daughter was encouraged to come and show me the ""English"" they taught her. She came to me slapped her hands together and shouted, ""Dynomite!!!""  They all laughed.  Good Times was 20+ years old by then. I had never said those words to my cast mates, but they found it appropriate to teach this little girl that ""cooning"" is what I would like."" ""My family was very openly refused taxi service in Berlin coming from an airport and
made such a scene that caused another White taxi driver to comment, ""What was his
problem?""  ""Primarily in Europe, make-up artists refuse to apply my make-up because
they don't know how to work with my complexion. I take this as fear on their part
because certainly they have the resources to research my skin tone and learn the best
methods to apply; however, time and time again they tell me just go without make-up while in the same show my lighter-skinned counterpart is spending an hour, on average, in the make-up room to be sure their features are highlighted."" ""While working in Europe I have been told that I can never sing certain traditional roles solely on the basis that I was black. This is something opera houses in America would
never be so bold to proclaim."" Meanwhile in America... ""I have never worn a wig in Europe or been ""whitened up"" as I have in the States."" ""We had a concert at a country club. I arrived with an Latino singer They told us we had to park in the back and enter through the kitchen. I told them that we were performing.  They said we still had to come through the kitchen. My colleague was going to do it. I told him I would go home first. I parked in front and walked through the front door. When I told the White singers what happened.They said, they parked in the front, walked in the front and no one had told them to do
differently."" ""Just after walking off stage and taking my bow, I walk out to the valet parking area to retrieve my Black Cadillac Escalade. As the truck pulls up, I tip the driver and open my door to get in when suddenly I'm stopped by an elderly Caucasian women who asks,
 ""Young man, where is the bus?""
 ""Pardon me ma'am?""
""The Bus. Where is it? Where did you park it? You DID drive the Bus DIDN'T you?"" ""I've had cabs called for me while staying at nice hotels that upon seeing me waiting in front of the hotel have attempted to refuse to take me somewhere until a concierge worker or someone from the hotel pressed the issue. But to end on a lighter note, there was once a couple that handed me the keys to their car to park it for them while at a company function. I guess they assumed I was the help since I was dressed in a tuxedo."" ""On a tour of the eastern seaboard with my boarding arts high school we encountered a donor who refused to house black students: as result two other black singers and I were put up in a hotel."" ""After a private donor party in a gated neighborhood a white female colleague and I
were talking and walking through the community when we were approached by a White police officer and told we were not welcome in the neighborhood. My White friend tried to speak up on our account, but the officer made it clear that he wasn't talking to her. I explained that I was there as a guest of prominent family and were just taking a walk. He threatened to arrest me for ""talking back."" ""Place: Metropolitan Opera. Very high level Donor dinner at a private restaurant ... Sitting at the table with all the Lindeman Young Artists, the director and several donors.  The wife of a donor turns to me and says,
 ""You know what? I'd just like to apologize to you for Slavery. I just think it was so bad. I mean I never OWNED slaves ... Well, my Family did years ago I guess ... but I never did. I mean we had blacks that helped out around the house and everything, but they weren't SLAVES ... They were like our family. But I'm serious ... It was just so bad ... and I just feel like I needed to say that to you!""
Everyone at the table sat there with their mouths open.""   ""I've been told, unfortunately more than once, that it's just too difficult to get my skin tone to make sense in the plot."" I've heard more times than you can imagine:  ""Nobody sings Old Man River like YOU people!"" ""When touring USA... I was responsible for all the expenses as it pertained to both my pianist and myself. There were a lot of wonderful people I met during my travels but unfortunately in some places I encountered some less than enlightened folks with their narrow attitudes or biases. One in particular was a desk clerk at a hotel who refused to look in my direction or even speak to me. She attempted to communicate with me only via my pianist and not acknowledge my existence at all. This was really comical since my pianist was standing a few steps behind me and I was the one with the credit card and handling the check-in. This was a situation that definitely needed to be dealt with in as stern and unambiguous a manner as was warranted. Her manager was beyond mortified and quite apologetic.""  ""I'm not sure if folks are really ready for that kind of truth in this business. I'm not sure of any Black man in this business that could say without a doubt that it hasn't been an issue."" Postscript: Barbara Conrad entered the University of Texas in 1956, the first year in which Black students were admitted to the University as undergraduates. With her natural talents and stage presence, Barbara was encouraged to audition for a role in the University's 1957 production of Dido and Aeneas. She was awarded the leading role of Dido, the Queen of Carthage, opposite a white boy as Aeneas, her lover. Soon after the start of rehearsals, word spread that a black girl and a white boy were to play the lead roles in a romantic opera, and Barbara's trouble began. Ultimately, the controversy escalated to the Texas legislature, and the president of the University was advised to remove her from the cast. Barbara's story was covered by national news media, prompting a carte blanche offer from Harry Belafonte to underwrite her studies at the institution of her choice. Barbara, however, chose to remain at the University. She triumphed by going on to sing leading roles throughout the world. There are many more from the pioneers who have broken the color barrier: Marian Anderson, George Shirley, Simon Estes, Leontyne Price, Reri Grist, Grace Bumbry, Todd Duncan, Shirley Verrett, William Warfield, and many more.

" The perfect beach read is in the eye of the beholder. For some, getting lost in a faraway fantasy world or suspenseful thriller appeals, and reduces the risk of dozing off, book firmly planted on face. For others, fantasy can be found closer to home, in whirlwind romances and compelling character studies. Whatever your preference, we recommend packing one of the following fun reads to dive into during your summer outings.
Naked at Lunch by Mark Haskell Smith
For many of us, being at a beach in the summer can feel weirdly like hanging out with a bunch of strangers in our underwear. (Right?) Haskell Smith’s rollicking Naked at Lunch does its absolute best to make us feel more comfortable in our skin. In his funny, thorough account of his investigative stint as a social nudist, he deftly balances reporting, dry humor, historical context and hilarious anecdotes. He overhears swingers having a casual orgy in Cap d’Agde, a bustling French nudist resort; he goes for a vigorous hike with a whole troop of naked people in the European Alps; he sees a man with a penis pump waving his erect member while frolicking at a nude beach in California. You may not be a total convert -- I sure wasn’t -- but Haskell Smith’s enthusiasm is infectious and his subject matter will make you appreciate the cool breeze on your mostly unclothed beach body more than ever. -Claire Fallon
The Diver’s Clothes Lie Empty by Vendela Vida
Vida’s narrator wanders the streets of Morocco in a series of increasingly absurd events. She’s lost her non-descript black backpack upon landing, and on her hunt to reclaim it, winds up backstage at a Patti Smith show, on set for a movie being filmed at her hotel, and telling flat-out lies to American embassy attendants. A funny, thoughtful commentary on the precariousness of identity. -Maddie Crum

Modern Romance by Aziz Ansari
This pop science book, which Ansari collaborated on with sociologist Eric Klinenberg, doesn’t promise the nonstop laughs of most big releases by standup comics. It does, however, offer a comprehensive dive into the dynamics of dating today, dissecting the relative merits of different texting approaches and the pitfalls of creating an online dating profile. The sober science may take the reins here, but Ansari manages to keep a subdued through-line of irreverent humor, illustrating points with ridiculous hypothetical scenarios and recounting particularly awkward text exchanges shared by audience members. For the dating-minded modern single, or anyone intrigued by the vagaries of relationships today, Modern Romance is the ideal beach read, breezy and easy-reading yet still substantive. -Claire
Find Me by Laura van den Berg
A more personal, contemplative take on doomsday plotlines, Find Me follows Joy on her escapades in a wayward hospital for survivors of a strange epidemic. Beginning with a silvery rash, the disease culminates in memory loss and death, but Joy, who’s endured a traumatic childhood that’s transported her from foster home to foster home, seems somehow immune. Sometime during the chaos of the apocalypse-torn country, she learns the identity of her birth mother, and sets out to find her. -Maddie

The Star Side of Bird Hill by Naomi Jackson
Jackson’s debut takes on heavy topics -- depression, grief, abandonment -- but with a backbone of hope that keeps the narrative aloft. Teenage Dionne and 10-year-old Phaedra have been sent to Barbados for the summer when their mother, Avril, no longer feels she can care for them in Brooklyn. With their grandmother, Hyacinth, the girls struggle to digest the sudden change in their lives and to find identities for themselves in Bird Hill, even to think of it as home. The characters, especially Phaedra, feel solid and alive, riddled with the flaws and idiosyncrasies no human is without. In simple, straightforward prose, Jackson maps the girls’ emotional developments as they learn to make sense of their family and their futures -- and a home where winter never comes. -Claire
Mayumi and the Sea of Happiness by Jennifer Tseng
Jennifer Tseng's novel comes from Europa -- the publisher of Elena Ferrante's acclaimed series -- and similarly employs Realism to reveal the wonders of everyday desires and the stifling strictures of a society's norms. A 40-something librarian whiles away her time, enjoying her days surrounded by books, until her infatuation with a younger patron invades her thoughts. While the plot is reminiscent of Doris Lessing's The Grandmothers, Tseng dives deeper into her narrator's thoughts and motivations. -Maddie
The Enlightenment of Nina Findlay by Andrea Gillies
Nina, driven to Greece by the collapse of her marriage and her best friendship, soon finds herself in a hospital bed recovering after being struck by a bus. There, in a sun-washed Grecian clinic, she has time to repeatedly rehash her mistakes, the path that led her to such an unsatisfying life. Best friends with Luca, a neighbor, as a girl, she ultimately married his brother instead, maintaining a decades-long friendship -- and flirtation -- with Luca, until shocking events wrecked both relationships. Nina is distracted from her meditations, however, by the handsome doctor at the clinic, who quickly takes an interest in his new patient; as he urges her to confide more and more in him, she sees that he offers another possible life. Gillies’ quiet rumination on midlife crises and self-knowledge, set in the midst of a balmy idyll, makes a perfect holiday read for the introspective reader. -Claire

The Life and Death of Sophie Stark by Anna North
North tells the story of a single, eccentric artist, Sophie Stark, through the intertwined lives of those close to her. Daniel, a fallen former athlete, met Sophie in college when he was the subject of her first film; Allison was “discovered” by Sophie while performing an embellished nonfiction story at a reading event. Through those she’s loved, we learn of Sophie’s difficulties with intimacy; she prefers life behind the lens to the messy, structureless real world. Film lovers or readers craving a compelling character study will relish going behind the scenes with Stark. -Maddie

Pretty Is by Maggie Mitchell
If you prefer to add a dark edge to your sunny vacation, this debut work of literary suspense should keep you on the edge of your beach chair. The plot hinges on the abduction of two little girls, a spelling bee champ and a beauty queen, by a man who keeps them in a remote cabin for two months. Years later, the two have moved past their childhood trauma, but when one, now an actress, receives a script for a movie shockingly similar to her own experience, the abduction’s consequences can’t stay buried in the past. -Claire
Saint Mazie by Jami Attenberg
Like North’s novel, Attenberg’s is structured as a fictional oral history of a single, remarkable woman. Mazie Phillips is a Prohibition-era partygoer who, when the Depression hits, eagerly takes on a new identity as a movie theater owner serving patrons in need. Mazie’s true story was shared in The New Yorker, but Attenberg imbues it with her lively voice and wit, penning Mazie’s diary and reflections on her vivacity from those who knew her. -Maddie
Hausfrau by Jill Alexander Essbaum
If you haven’t yet picked up this taut domestic drama, summer vacation isn’t a bad time. Desperate housewife Anna Benz, is an American woman who moved to Switzerland with her Swiss banker husband. With two young children, but no real friends or distractions, Anna turns to the comfort of illicit flings -- initially carefully controlled, but eventually deeply consuming and even self-destructive. Essbaum, a poet, infuses the book with finely crafted, playful prose, but it’s the suspenseful narrative that will keep you turning the pages. -Claire

The Rocks by Peter Nichols
Nichols’ novel might be the most literal beach read selection, which isn’t to say the story won’t transport you. A sailing enthusiast, he sets his story in stunning, sleep Mallorca, where the lives of two couples -- one set of honeymooners driven apart by a mysterious incident, and their star-crossed children, who find love on the same island decades later -- slowly collide. The Rocks is a sensual treasure, a love story and a subtle examination of the tides of time. -Maddie
Local Girls by Caroline Zancan
You’re at your favorite beach-town bar, and your celebrity crush walks in. What next? Zancan puts an intense, psychological spin on this dream scenario in Local Girls. The girls, three close friends from near Orlando, spot their favorite movie star in their local watering hole, and unexpectedly, he strikes up a conversation with them. The result: Long-suppressed grievances between the friends bubble to the surface, upending their solid, lifelong friendship. Zancan infuses her narrative with both carefree fun and deeply felt human emotions familiar to any reader who’s experience a complicated friendship. -Claire
Seveneves by Neal Stephenson
Stephenson’s novel isn’t the dreamy, lackadaisical sort of book you’d hope to curl up with on the sand, but if you’re hunting for an enthralling saga -- something to keep you alert while you laze -- Seveneves is a strong, explosive contender. It spans millennia -- from the near-end of the world to surviving humans’ apprehensive return 5,000 years later. It’s not a “hard science” read a la The Martian -- instead, Stephenson weaves in politics and philosophy, as he explores the tension between the reassembled nations that cropped up post-apocalypse. -Maddie
Let Me Explain You by Annie Liontas
Let’s say you need a few laughs on your vacation -- isn’t that what vacations are all about? Liontas’ energetic saga infuses a poignant family drama with raucous humor and outsize characters. When Stavros Stavros Mavrakis, believing he has only 10 days to live, sends his family a harsh email berating them for how they’re each failing at life, they laugh it off. Soon after, however, he disappears, and his ex-wife and three daughters begin to wonder if he is actually dying. Let Me Explain You has both heart and hilarity, the perfect combination for a poolside read. -Claire ",he,sees,life
"If you’re lucky enough to get tickets to Mary Jane, a heartbreaking comedy by Amy Herzog now playing at New York Theatre Workshop, you may emerge from the experience as I did, exhilarated and shaken. A flawless cast led by The Leftovers’ Carrie Coon brings to gorgeously odd life the story of a mother whose devotion to her son breaks the limits of reason, bleeding into something either mad or profound. Pairing a deceptive lightness with fearless emotional directness, this exploration of the heights and depths humans are capable of is layered atop ordinary details of daily existence in a way that feels both familiar and startling. Mary Jane’s multiply award-winning director, Anne Kauffman, a cofounder of the Civilians theater group, has earned a reputation as a helmer skilled at creating the perfect stage language for boldly original works, including Detroit, Slowgirl and Maple and Vine. The director spoke with me by phone about past, present and future art. Congratulations on the exquisite production of “Mary Jane.” It's a miracle when everything comes together so magically. Have you had that happen a lot?  Anne Kauffman: No, I have not had that happen a lot. And we theater people are just, we’re after that rush, you know what I mean? We kill ourselves to get that, and it's so infrequent that it happens. You wonder how we can stand the rest of the time. What do you do when it doesn't happen—or do you always see glimpses of it? I think so. If it’s worth it, it’s pursued, then there’s something—it sounds Pollyanna-ish, but there's a part of it that feels like that, hopefully. I would say it’s more rare for me to feel that there's nothing redeemable about a piece. When did you first know that theater was for you?  I don’t think I’ve ever not known. I can’t remember, really, a time—I actually did stuff in grade school, and then I didn’t do any of it in high school, because I followed in my sisters’ footsteps—I’m one of six children, and I’m number five out of six, so I often say that probably my exhibitionism is a huge part of why I went [into it], and the need for attention. But when I was in high school, I was a cheerleader, I was in student government—I was one of those types. Your exhibitionism may have led you to the theater as an actor, but directing is selfless. You’re giving yourself over to others, serving everyone else, the writer and the actors.  But we also like control, which I realize is another part of my personality. I think I figured out in college that I wasn't the star, the musical theater star, that I hoped I would be. I also found I sort of lost interest—just focusing on one thing grew dull to me. Something about the challenge of being responsible for the entire orchestration of things was the thing that actually really kept me engaged, and satisfied my need to dig in and organize and orchestrate and bring a vision—whatever that vision was—to life. How did you come to directing? I took a class in undergrad, I'm not sure why—it was terrifying to me. It's still terrifying, directing is a terrifying pursuit. It's an impossible thing that we do, and it's way overwhelming, and it's really the reason to do it too, like I said, it's really the thing that keeps me fully engaged, to be overwhelmed. I don't really understand why I started doing it, but I think I directed something in my dorm [at Stanford], and then I took a class, and I remember very distinctly the professor pulled me aside one day and said, ""How does it feel to be a director?"" And I found that astonishing, just out of control. Like some sort of mantle had been placed on my shoulders that was both exhilarating and hugely burdensome. It was a very exciting moment. From school in California, how did you find your way to New York City?  I'm actually from Phoenix, Arizona. When each of us graduated from the eighth grade, my dad would take each of us, on our own, to our first trip back east, so he took us to New York City and Washington, D.C. And there were several things that we were put through in order to earn the trip. We had to memorize the preamble to the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights. This was in the days when you could actually walk up the Statue of Liberty, so every night we'd do squats in my parents’ bedroom to get ready to go up. And in New York, every night and every matinee, we went to go see a show. I remember really not liking New York City because we went in the summer when it was very humid and disgusting and crowded and horrible. But when I went to the theater I was just, I was 13 years old and I already had aspirations. We would go home to the hotel after the shows and I would cry myself to sleep. I was very passionate about it—despite the humidity and the disgusting pollution and the stench at that time—that was 1982. Is it strange to find yourself now doing the thing that transported you? I think about this so much. I think about that girl and I think about how hard, how challenging the road is to become a director, I think about that every single day. I’m never far from it–I feel very close to not making it. It’s so precarious, because there truly is no path. The path to director, each of us is creating our own path, we’re trailblazing our own, because no one’s getting there the exact same way. Particularly for women, it feels like it’s almost impossible to have opportunities. There’s more of us who are in a greater position of influence, but yeah, definitely, the ratio is not what it should be, that’s for sure. How did this project come to you? Is there some particular thing you look for in the plays you want to do? In this particular instance, Amy Herzog and I worked together on a play called Belleville a few years ago. I establish relationships with playwrights, so pretty much if someone like Amy Herzog—and Amy Herzog in particular, I would say—comes to me with a play, I’m pretty predisposed to say yes. She’s such an extraordinary writer and just an extraordinary human being. She’s a very sly writer, because it seems as though she’s a mainstream writer, but in fact she’s quite experimental. This play is extraordinary on so many levels: she’s playing with so many different levels of genre and consciousness and pursuit and text. She’s an astonishing thinker and writer. Honestly, I had no idea—I was like, “Okay, Amy, sure, let’s do this play, this is a difficult play, it’s a difficult emotional play.” And even I who know Amy very well can take her work at face value, when in fact it has nothing to do with face value. It all lives underneath. So I didn’t really know what I was in for. When we did this at Yale, we did the production that I thought was there, and we did it well. Revisiting it—it’s extraordinary when you know you’ll have another chance; to have that second chance, which we got with Belleville too—it flowered in a completely different way. My interaction with it and its profound effect on me—it opened up even more. You know, the high holidays were this past week, and I haven’t been to synagogue, it’s got to be 10 years. And this year, after working on Amy’s play and talking to a very particular rabbi about the Hasidic woman in the play, I was like, “I need to go to synagogue!” [Laughs] Because the play is actually in such complex pursuit of spirituality and what it is to become—who you were, who you are now, and what it is to become in your next iteration—it made me go to temple! I would get more meaning from the play than temple, but that’s just me. The combination of going back to synagogue and having a very particular experience there, and merging how I felt like our rehearsals were like a kind of philosophical rumination—combining what it felt like in the rehearsal room with these particular women talking about the stuff that we were talking about, in conjunction with temple—this is going to sound very crazy, but I actually figured out, finally, my interpretation of God. [After] many, many years of people being like, “Do you believe in God? Do you believe in God?” and [my saying], “There’s probably a higher power, I don’t know what it is,” but completely avoiding and avoiding and avoiding it, suddenly it was like, “Oh, that’s what it is!” And it’s very simple and very clear to me, and very reassuring. [Pause] If I tell Amy I found God going to temple because of the show, she’s going to laugh at me. I can see the play leading you to that conclusion. In essence it is a pure portrait of love and devotion. It’s so unwavering in its pursuit of what’s real, no matter how difficult; it looks it in the eye. One of the reasons Mary Jane is such a remarkable character is that she doesn’t flinch from anything. We’re accustomed to characters who are too cheerful in the face of horrors, we think of them as deluded, and Mary Jane is transcendent. She is fearless in everything she addresses, and naked in her emotions and honesty, and it leaves an indelible mark because it’s so powerful.  You just came off of directing Scott McPherson’s “Marvin’s Room” on Broadway. I remember seeing the original and thinking there were good things about it, but when I saw your production, I realized what a great play it is. I wasn’t prepared for how much I liked it, how both of your movie stars gave such beautiful performances, far beyond what I thought either was capable of. I didn’t even recognize the voices they were using, the lightness and the nuance—and of course the young man was remarkable. I know it probably did not do as well as it deserved to do. Did you feel a lot of pressure going into that production? Was it scary to go to Broadway? You know, it’s funny, it was not scary. It’s taken me a long time to get there. It’s also nonprofit Broadway, so it has a different kind of feel to it—I haven’t done commercial Broadway, so I don’t really know. But it felt like a very comfortable graduation. You know, I came to New York when Marvin’s Room was originally produced in New York—I like to think that both Scott and I made our move at the same time [laughs]. That genre of theatre, that’s what I was raised on, the kind of wacky sense of humor, with darkness. He’s not quite as strange as Harry Kondoleon, but I feel like he shares the absurdity. Grounded in emotion, addressing meaningful things. So I was very happy to do that. Of course, my tastes have changed, and my sensibility is different, but I love the idea that I’m someone who directs Amy Herzog’s play and brings that sensibility to a Scott McPherson play that was done in the ’90s—because that’s what that production was for me; I felt like I was exploring the more ruminatory aspects of it. Also, doing that play right before doing Mary Jane—actually, that play was sandwiched between the Yale production of Mary Jane and the New York Theatre Workshop production of Mary Jane, so I was sort of dumped into the deep end of caretaking, and women who are caretakers. Putting caretaking and disability at the center of a piece and looking right at it is something that we do not do in this country, and Scott McPherson, by gosh, he did that. He did. Laura Jellinek, who did the set for A Life and for Marvin’s Room and for Mary Jane, we were laughing, because we were working on two shows where a character who is ill is behind a wall. And what you experience are the reverberations of that human being who is so deeply loved by the people that we’re actually seeing roam around the stage. You see that person very much in the DNA of the people we’re looking at, but it’s not about that person, just like Mary Jane’s not about [her son] Alex, it’s about Mary Jane. If you could do anything at all, what would it be? I would like to revisit Spring Awakening, the actual play. The play is so much darker than the musical. It has everything that I love about the theater in it. Another thing I’m working on very passionately and diligently is to bring The Sign in Sidney Brustein’s Window, the Lorraine Hansberry play that I did in Chicago, to New York. It’s a beautiful play. I don’t know it at all. What’s your next adventure? I’m doing the next show at the New York Theatre Workshop, which is a theatrical concert called Hundred Days by the Bengsons, who are a husband-and-wife composing-musician team. And then we’re doing their next project at Ars Nova in the winter. They’re an extraordinary duo, and they make beautiful work. And it continues in the tradition of the darkness that I explore. The dark time we’re living in is so surreal. Each day somebody dies too young, I think, “Trump killed him/her,” because the added stress and aggravation and horror and anxiety, I just feel, is pressing down on all of us. Does it ever seem like doing art is a luxury we can’t afford in these dire times? I find that art is a pretty important part of the ecosystem of a society. I think of it as a necessity. I don’t think my work can change the world, but I think it’s a necessary part of the conversation. I said yesterday to a group of people: “I’m so lucky, because I’m not a policymaker, I don’t have to make policy, I don’t have to make decisions. But what I do do, what I’m committed to doing is presenting and reminding people of the complexities of who we are as human beings, so that when those policymakers are making those policies, that they remember, they look before they leap.” That is, I think, the role of art—to remember ourselves to us, and to complexify things that are so black-and-white. Certainly Trump is making things black-and-white. But in order to make a decision, things have to kind of come down to a black-and-white situation. Gradations of gray are a difficult thing, but they have to go into the decision-making. And that’s what I think art does. It remembers that.",Jane,think,them
"Artist David Mesguich is deeply proud of his latest work. “It is projects like this which upset the sense of fatality!” he exclaims. His pride stems from the extraordinary nature of his project: instead of a gallery or museum, Mesguich has been working to beautify one of France’s harshest prisons. Last February, Mesguich worked with prison inmates who were receiving medical and psychological treatment to paint two immense murals against backdrops of gray cement and barbed wire. His goal, he says, was, “to show the prisoners... that beautiful and positive things can still come from inside them.”  Marseilles’ Baumettes prison is one of the most notorious in France. Earlier this year a scandal erupted when inmates posted images of themselves on Facebook posing with money, drugs and weapons. The proliferation of forbidden goods and weapons among prisoners highlighted Baumettes’ critical shortage of staffers.  In 2012, then-French Prison Inspector General Jean-Marie Delarue denounced Baumettes' prison conditions in a damning report, referring to them as “inhuman” and citing severe overcrowding, vermin infestations, building decay and high rates of violence between inmates. For Mesguich, working in this prison was a deeply personal project. “I encountered the prison world very early on, due to a rough upbringing,” he says. “As a young boy, I visited a number of prisons, and, as an adolescent, I knew of Baumettes, where my father was incarcerated. So, since childhood, I have reflected on isolation and separation.”  This reflection led him to the idea of a “monumental” project: two murals, each over six-feet high, painted by six prisoners in the complicated conditions that accompany incarceration.  “It was not simple to put this in place, because the constraints of the prison environment determine the way the work can happen,” Mesguich explained. “For example, I did not have the right to use a ladder to reach the top of the mural when the prisoners and the nurses were with me. And time for work on the mural was limited to two hours for the prisoners. So I came back during off-hours, between noon and two, and continued alone at the site with the ladder. The rest of the time, I waited in a room while the time passed.”

 Working in a prison was a deep calling for Mesguich, who has frequently taken his artwork to the streets. But his work also poses the question of the real benefit this type of project might have for inmates. Sociologist Jean Bérard, a professor at the University of Montreal, has worked on the history of French prison reform. According to him, “It is difficult to respond on behalf of [the prisoners] about what such an initiative can bring to them. But the limits of such initiatives are known: they involve a minority of prisoners, and cannot radically transform the way an institution of imprisonment operates.” For Didier Fassin, sociologist and author of The Shadow Of The World: An Anthropology Of The Penal Condition, the initiative is compelling -- although difficult to assess without commentary from the inmates. “It transforms the prison space, and brightens it, while emphasizing by contrast the ugly and oppressive character of the metal gates, the barbed wire, and the walls,” he says. “This being the case, the question is more general, as is the case with cities. Making murals in a city does not change its reality.” But what is essential for Mesguich is the fact that “these creations bring humanity to a place where it is lacking.” He did not wish for the inmates to serve as the manpower for the realization of his project. What he wanted was for them to participate at his side in the creation of a shared work. And so the murals bear his signature, but also those of the prisoners who worked on them: Marco, Noël, Momo, Jeoffrey and Michel.

"On September 24, the world became a little poorer. Barbara Blaine, who to me embodied the Catholic social justice gospel, died from a heart ailment. Blaine was 61. Earlier this year, she had retired from the organization she had founded, the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP). This is how I remember her. It was a cold, drizzly April day in Chicago in 2015. I had just finished my second interview with Barbara Blaine, one of the women I profile in my book, Catholic Women Confront Their Church: Stories of Hurt and Hope. I was hurrying to make my flight back to Washington, D.C., planning to hail a cab to O’Hare Airport. But Blaine insisted that the subway was faster and cheaper. The fare is $5, but you need exact change, Blaine told me. I only had 20s in my wallet. Blaine counted out five $1 bills from her purse and handed them to me, insisting I take them. Blaine was not a tycoon. For many years, her work with the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP) earned her no compensation. Even after more than two decades, with a membership of more than 20,000 and members throughout the world, the organization’s office was in a building with a lot of character but quirky plumbing and unreliable elevators. That spontaneous generosity was at the heart of who she was. Her commitment to the social justice message of the gospels, and her prophetic voice, exemplified what Catholicism should be all about. If Saint Paul was right when he wrote that “the whole law is fulfilled in one statement, namely: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself,’” I can think of few women who better lived up to Catholicism’s highest demands. All her life, Blaine served other people in direct and uncompromising ways. Just out of high school, she worked in Jamaica, helping an order of women religious minister to the poor in Kingston. After two years as a volunteer, she returned to the states, earning undergraduate and graduate degrees in social work. She then returned to Jamaica for one more year of service, but ultimately was drawn to the Catholic Worker movement. She ran a Catholic Worker house in Chicago for 10 years. But even as she was serving the poor and vulnerable, she was carrying a terrible secret and a burden of guilt. Rev. Chet Warren, the assistant pastor at her family’s parish in Toledo, Ohio, a man she had trusted and looked up to, had sexually abused her for four years, beginning when she was 13. For years, she did not consider that terrible experience to have been abuse. She thought she had been responsible for what happened. It wasn’t until 1985, when she read Jason Berry’s accounts of sexual abuse by priests in the National Catholic Reporter, that she began to realize that she had been the victim of abuse, that she was not an evil, seductive temptress. At that point, Blaine could have opted to focus entirely on herself, trying to heal the trauma of abuse, opting for an existence centered on her own needs. She could have closed the door on the Catholic Church. She did neither. She spent a lifetime trying to help and support victims of clerical abuse. And she worked ceaselessly to push and prod the institutional church to do more to recognize abuse, address it, and protect the children in its care. Blaine made one concession to her well-being. She left the Catholic Worker house, realizing that addressing the urgent needs of the people she served “was almost blocking me from dealing with my own issues.” She enrolled in law school, but with social justice still in mind. As a newly minted lawyer, she worked for the Cook County Public Guardian, representing abused and neglected children. In 1989, when Blaine founded SNAP, it also was in keeping with her social justice mission – offering help to those in pain. But as the group’s founder, she also took on another role – prophet. Blaine likely would have scoffed at the title. But in her more than 25 years at SNAP, she was tireless in her efforts to confront a church hierarchy that too often wanted to hide child abuse rather than prevent it. Prophets speak truth to power, and power often does not want to listen. As Catholic scholar Stephen Colecchi points out, the Old Testament prophets called attention to the ways Israel and its religious leaders fell short of their ideals. The prophet Isaiah inveighed against rulers “who enact unjust statutes … making widows their plunder and orphans their prey.” Over the years, Blaine repeatedly approached Catholic priests and bishops, warning of the problem of sexual abuse in the church, and asking them to institute common-sense reforms to ensure that children would be protected from predators. In the late 1980s, Blaine told her story of abuse to the Toledo diocese. The bishop at the time promised her that Warren would be closely monitored. But a few years later, she learned that the church had not warned others about Warren, who then was serving as a hospital chaplain, or protected hospitalized children from him. “It was like a knife going through my stomach,” Blaine said in a 2014 radio interview. “I felt so betrayed.” And repeated efforts by Blaine and SNAP to work with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) on reforms have met with repeated disappointments. One of the most heart-breaking for Blaine concerned Archbishop Harry Flynn, head of the St. Paul-Minneapolis archdiocese. In 2002, Flynn drafted a USCCB policy on handling sexual abuse. Flynn endorsed “zero tolerance” for sexual predators, and Blaine trusted him. But in 2014, Minnesota Public Radio broadcast a scathing exposé of three Minnesota archbishops, including Flynn. Each archbishop had conspired to deceive abuse victims and cover up priestly misconduct.] Flynn “had been lying to us,” she told me. Only one bishop has not disappointed her, Detroit Auxiliary Bishop Thomas Gumbleton, now retired. Gumbleton endorsed changing an Ohio law to extend the statute of limitations concerning sexual abuse allegations against members of the clergy. Gumbleton, himself the victim of abuse as a young seminarian, was swiftly punished by the Vatican for publicly disagreeing with Ohio bishops, who opposed the changes. Despite all the heartbreak and frustration, Blaine, like all good prophets, persevered. SNAP even has urged the United Nations to hold the Vatican accountable for crimes of abuse against children. This public scrutiny, she said, is crucial. “If we don’t acknowledge the evil,” she said, “we cannot begin to rid the church of evil.” And she took comfort in knowing that, because of SNAP, thousands of abuse victims no longer felt alone and unsupported. In 2015, Blaine speculated how Jason Berry’s reporting on the abuse scandal thirty years ago had changed her life. She wrote that it has been the support of Catholic laity that has made the difference. “My crisis, our crises, became a cause. Our cause became a movement. And our movement has made a safer church, though not yet safe enough.”",thousands,took,victims
"Sometimes the law is on your side in cases of employment discrimination. And sometimes it isn’t. If you are a woman, person of color, older or disabled, chances are high that if you fought the law, the law won. The bombshell release last week of allegations against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein for decades of sexual harassment and discrimination against women resulted in his being fired from his position as co-chair of the Weinstein Company. The fallout was decisive. “It is essential to our Company’s culture that all women who work for it or have any dealings with it or any of our executives are treated with respect and have no experience of harassment or discrimination,” the board reported, according to Buzzfeed. But such swift and definitive action is not the norm. The silence around a legacy of incidents like those surrounding Hurricane Harvey Weinstein is perpetuated in most all industries. The authors of the new book, Rights on Trial: How Workplace Discrimination Perpetuates Inequality, examined nearly 2,000 cases filed between 1988 and 2003 across the U.S.. The three authors interviewed more than 100 plaintiffs, defendants, lawyers and involved parties to find that the workplace often is not fair in cases of discrimination. The success rate for cases of discrimination filed is dismal; only two percent of plaintiffs win at trial. That is after 19 percent of the cases were dismissed. Half or 50 percent have early settlements, 18 percent of the cases are lost on summary judgment and 8 percent of the cases have a late settlement. But each one of those cases is a story. And in each one of of those cases, voice is a metaphor for civil justice. “Voice is important in legal disputes,” says Laura Beth Nielsen, a co-author of the book, that literally gives voice to those involved with audio clips of the interviews on its site. In these “workplace wars,” the stories are heartbreaking,” says Nielsen, research professor at the American Bar Foundation, and Professor of Sociology and Director of Legal Studies at Northwestern University. Consider the case of Kristen Baker, whose case is highlighted in the book. Baker was a 33-year-old assistant buyer in the sales division of a small, family-owned manufacturing company. A salesman “began bringing pornographic magazines and movies to work” and also charging for admission to viewing parties of those movies in the conference room at lunch time. He showed her pictures of bestiality. She filed multiple complaints to human resources, then the final straw was the salesman’s physical act of sexual harassment. So Baker filed a discrimination case. Her employer offered her $10,000 to leave the company. Baker eventually settled for $1, a public apology and the option to keep her job. Authors Nielsen, Robert L. Nelson and Ellen Berrey write in the book: It may be difficult to believe that discrimination this blatant and offensive still occurs in American workplaces every day, but it does. In her new book, Reset: My Fight for Inclusion and Lasting Change, Ellen Pao, who lost her $16 million gender discrimination lawsuit against the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 2015, said it was worth it to tell her story that “started a conversation about systemic bias in Silicon Valley, giving others the courage to report their own experiences,” according to Recode. “The sad thing is we tend to reject people who make rights claims,” says Nelson, a co-author and  Director Emeritus of the American Bar Foundation, the MacCrate Research Chair in the Legal Profession at the ABF, and professor of sociology and law at Northwestern. “We have a process where prominent stereotypes about persons of color, women, the aged and disabled” come into play, Nelson says. A  gender discrimination suit was filed recently against Winston & Strawn, adding to gender discrimination suits by former attorneys against legacy law firms Steptoe & Johnson LLP, Chadbourne & Parke, Proskauer Rose, LeClairRyan and Sedgwick, according to Above The Law.   In the most recent case brought by Constance Ramos, “as reported by Law.com, the complaint alleges Ramos was never treated as a lawyer and partner in her own right, but as ‘an appendage of a male superior’ that the firm sought to be rid of when the equity partners that Ramos joined the firm with, ultimately left Winston.” Ramos’ experience of being excluded from meetings is similar to the experiences of Pao, who told PBS News Hour: Such high profile lawsuits are extremely rare. Fewer than one percent of employees who perceive they were discriminated against, file a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. And only 15 percent of EEOC charges lead to a lawsuit filed, and only 6 percent of those cases make it to trial. “We see a symbolic valorization of rights in the abstract,” says co-author Ellen Berrey, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Toronto and an affiliated scholar of the American Bar Foundation. But in real, concrete terms, there is “structural inequality,” Berrey says, recalling that one defense attorney claimed he “never saw a valid case.” While this book covers U.S. cases, workplace discrimination is an international problem. “According to a 2017 report by the International Labor Organization (ILO), there is no universally accepted definition of ‘harassment’ or ‘violence’ with regard to the world of work,” according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Gayle Tzemach Lemmon writes: In this country, to improve the system and to change policy with “the levers of power,” according to Nelson, the authors offer several suggestions. These strategies include providing more access to legal representation; more EEOC resources and state fair employment agencies; better forms of communication with the EEOC and charging parties; access to employee information for employees on demographics and compensation; and addressing racial disparities in legal representation. Employees telling their stories of discrimination and reporting are initial steps.  The more voices, the louder the call for equity.

"Title VII of The Civil Rights Act of 1964 created the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission to ensure equal, employment advancement for all and makes employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin illegal.  However, substantial progress in increasing the number of diverse attorneys within the American legal profession has been abysmally slow since the Act's passage. Diverse attorneys have faced incredible obstacles in advancing professionally when compared to their non-diverse counterparts. Consequently, attorneys within the American legal profession do not adequately reflect the diversity of the current population. The legal profession severely lags behind other professions when it comes to diversity and inclusion, which is ironic considering the nature of the profession. Unfortunately, this trend will continue unless something is done to reverse it.  The good news is that minority students are applying and being accepted into law schools more than ever before. For example, during the 2013-2014 academic year, minorities comprised 26.9 percent of total J.D. enrollment and 29.1 percent of first year enrollment. While these stats show a promising trend of increased diversity within law schools, more significant gains must be made because law school is a crucial gateway in the legal profession's diversity pipeline. In the midst of declining enrollment, some schools are looking to diverse candidates merely as a means to fill potentially empty seats in their first year classes and replace lost tuition revenue. However, the better and more honorable practice would be to actively enroll promising, diverse students, coupled with diversity and cultural competence programming, to enrich the educational environment for all students.  Diversity not only makes good business sense, it is also paramount in demonstrating that fair representation and equal access are necessary for justice, a foundational tenet of the legal profession. Developing a diverse and inclusive law school community is critical for creating a richer experience and maintaining relevance. This experience translates into better lawyers with deeper understanding of the profession's global realities, more capabilities in representing a diverse client base, and heightened cultural intelligence - skills that are absent without multicultural experiences.  Law schools are the legal profession's pipeline, and should set the tone for the profession's future. The challenge of recruiting, retaining, and training a diverse workforce should be intricately integrated within law schools' entire framework (i.e., through admissions, courses, initiatives, experiential learning opportunities, and career development) and sustained in conjunction with key partnerships from bar associations and legal employers. If law schools have not provided significant traction on this important issue, how can the burden be placed entirely on others when training and professional development begins in law school? As champions of justice, law schools need to facilitate and encourage dialogue around diversity and inclusion, not shy away from potentially heated topics, such as race. For example, law professors should strive to incorporate critical analysis conversations about the case of Freddie Grey and the Baltimore City Police Department within the context of their classes. Clearly, the discourse here is that these teachable moments within the curriculum to provide real, practical solutions to facilitate legal change are not being done enough or at all. Cultivating a diverse and inclusive law school environment that best funnels qualified, culturally dexterous professionals into the profession is invaluable to the community at large, mirrors our melting pot society, and is pivotal in diversifying the legal profession. Using a more strategically ingrained approach should be a solution to positively impact the legal profession's lack of diversity.""",Developing,is,relevance
"After a devastating hurricane season and vague threats of nuclear war, a number of men piled heaps of refuse onto the dumpster fire that has been 2017 as the public learned about an epidemic of sexual misconduct. The stories have spanned coastlines. Former super-producer Harvey Weinstein is said to have raped, assaulted and harassed dozens of women in the entertainment industry. Some 300 women say director James Toback has done things like masturbate in front of them without consent. Former Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) reportedly encouraged a woman to touch his groin. The accused stand in depressingly good company: Kevin Spacey, Al Franken, Glenn Thrush, Mark Halperin, Charlie Rose, Ed Westwick, Danny Masterson, Mario Batali and more. Shortly after “King of Comedy” Louie C.K. joined their ranks for masturbating in front of women without their consent, writer Ashley Simon hatched an idea that would become the common-decency instruction manual Where Does Your Penis Belong?, a primer for men that was released this week. “Do we need to go back to 101 behavior here?” Simon jokingly wondered over dinner with friends, who later encouraged the project. She was also spurred on by victim-blaming responses to the women who shared their experiences. “I was grossed out by the insinuation that women should know not to go into these hotel rooms, as if it’s on you to know that someone’s going to expose themselves without your consent and in a professional situation,” Simon told HuffPost.  In the book, priced at $24.99, a series of prompts allows readers to absorb a message through repetition: Whether it be in the office or on the train, one’s penis should stay in one’s pants.  Profits will be donated to RAINN, the sexual violence prevention organization. Billed as “A Children’s Book for Grown-Ass Men,” the collaborative project from Simon, illustrator Allison Gore and web designer Isla Murray is available through Blurb, the self-publishing platform. Response has been enthusiastic, Simon said, with about 100 copies sold in the first few hours of the book’s release and a stream of supportive tweets. A website for Where Does Your Penis Belong? explains that the book had been “a therapeutic exercise” for the three women, who felt “a desperate need for some comedic relief in the wake of so much trauma and outrage.” At the bottom of the site, visitors can even input Twitter handles of men they believe might benefit from the educational message contained in Where Does Your Penis Belong?

"NEWTON, Mass. ― A thirtysomething man sought to buy a rifle here last September, and if he had been living in almost any other part of the country, he could have done so easily.  His record was free of arrests, involuntary psychiatric commitments or anything else that might automatically disqualify him from owning firearms under federal law. He could have walked into a gun store, filled out a form and walked out with a weapon in less than an hour.  But he couldn’t do that in Massachusetts because the state requires would-be buyers to get a permit first. That means going through a much longer process and undergoing a lot more scrutiny. Each applicant must complete a four-hour gun safety course, get character references from two people, and show up at the local police department for fingerprinting and a one-on-one interview with a specially designated officer. Police must also do some work on their own, searching department records for information that wouldn’t show up on the official background check.  If the police come to believe an applicant is a possible threat to public safety, they can refuse to grant the permit. And that is what happened in the case of this man from Newton. Police records showed eight visits to his home from 2008 to 2012, each time in response to calls from family members concerned about his behavior. On one occasion, according to the police account, the man had punched a picture frame and lacerated his hand; another time, he had been wielding a knife and threatening to commit suicide. Officers took the man into protective custody after three of the visits, the reports said, and at nearly all of them he was intoxicated. This December, following a procedure that Massachusetts law lays out, Newton’s chief filed a five-page memo with a state district court. It summarized the incident reports, one by one, and concluded that the man “had exhibited or engaged in behavior that could potentially create a risk to public safety.” The man, who declined to comment for this article and whose name HuffPost is not publishing, challenged the police decision in court, as the law allows applicants to do. A written filing stated that he has completed treatment for alcohol addiction, as a physician independently confirmed. It also said that he has a steady job and noted that there have been no incidents since 2012.   A district judge considered the argument and, a few weeks later, upheld the police department’s decision. The man from Newton is now appealing that decision. But whether or not he ultimately gets his permit, his story illustrates just how aggressively Massachusetts regulates gun ownership. No other state requires a permit for any kind of gun purchase while also giving police some discretion to deny those permits.  The combination could help explain why the state’s mortality rate from firearms incidents is relatively low, according to some experts who have studied these types of laws. That makes the Massachusetts permit system a potential model for legislation in other states, or even the country as a whole, at a time when the massacre at a high school in Parkland, Florida, has put gun violence back on the political agenda. But replicating the Massachusetts program would require persuading or overcoming resistance from gun rights advocates, starting with the members of the National Rifle Association who are meeting in Dallas this weekend. They are convinced that permit systems like the one in Massachusetts do little to deter violence, while doing a lot to undermine the Second Amendment.  Massachusetts has required that gun owners get permits since 1968, although initially the state approved permits automatically for anybody without major crime convictions or other disqualifying factors. In the parlance of gun control, it was a “shall issue” system rather than a “may issue” system, in which officials or law enforcement would have had leeway to deny licenses in certain circumstances.  That changed in 1998, when state lawmakers gave police broad discretion to withhold handgun licenses for people who were, in the police department’s judgment, “unsuitable.” In 2014, following the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, Massachusetts lawmakers, led by House Speaker Robert DeLeo, strengthened its gun laws yet again, expanding police discretion so that it applied to rifles and shotguns, too.  The permit process for rifles and shotguns is slightly different than the process for handguns, but they lead to the same basic result: Today, police can deny ownership of any kind of firearm, subject to court review. That made Massachusetts unique. The other two states with police discretion over ownership, New Jersey and New York, apply that method only to handguns.  The 2014 law also clarified, somewhat, when and how police in Massachusetts should use their discretion. By law, the police can restrict a license or deny one outright anytime they have credible evidence that somebody may pose a threat to public safety. The “credible” part is supposed to keep the police from acting arbitrarily; police actually have to file papers with a local court justifying denials. The “may” part is supposed to make it clear that the police can limit or withhold a license anytime they believe a mere threat exists. They don’t have to wait until they are certain or even nearly certain an applicant would use a gun for crime or self-harm. One way to think of the system is that it places the burden of proof for denying a license on the police while making it clear that the proof does not have to be overwhelming. And, although the state still does not specify exactly what constitutes a threat and what doesn’t, that’s precisely the sort of judgment call best left to city and town officials, supporters of the law say.  “Gun violence is usually local, among people who know each other,” John Rosenthal, co-founder of the organization Stop Handgun Violence and a longtime advocate for tighter gun laws, said in an interview with HuffPost. “Who better than the local police chief to issue renewable licenses and be able to have that discretion every six years?” Many experts agree. “Local police chiefs typically know more about the people in their community than does a national computer,” David Hemenway, a well-respected gun violence researcher at Harvard, told The Trace. Even with the new system in place, the vast majority of people who apply for licenses get them, according to a 2017 evaluation that a panel of experts conducted for the state’s Executive Office of Public Safety and Security. But 1 to 3 percent do not, depending on the year, the panel determined.  That number doesn’t account for the people who don’t even try to get licenses, because they know police would not grant them. And even among those residents who get licenses, many will have restrictions on how they may use their guns. They might not have freedom to carry a firearm outside the home, for example, except for transporting it to firing ranges or hunting grounds. (This is one way in which the Massachusetts practice is more typical. Many states give the police discretion over who gets to carry a gun outside of the home.) In general, police from rural parts of Massachusetts are a lot less likely to issue restrictions than the departments in cities and surrounding suburbs, according to a compilation of 2016 statistics by Commonwealth Second Amendment, which advocates for gun rights. Police say such differentials are largely a byproduct of the very different way departments operate depending on the size and closeness of their communities. “Most people we know one way or another ― it’s a neighbor, or a neighbor’s friend or co-worker, or somebody you deal with on the job,” Lu-Ann Czapala, the firearms officer in Ware, said during an interview at the city’s headquarters. Ware, a former mill town in the rural area between Worcester and Springfield, has a population just shy of 10,000. “Very few people who come in and apply have anything in their background that would cause a problem.” That’s not to say it never happens. “The ones who get our attention,” Czapala said, “are the ones we’ve had to see before, to come to their houses, with incidents that don’t rise up to arrests but tell us, ‘Hey, something is not right here. Gee, we’ve been to this house so many times.’” And, in that respect, the process is quite similar to Newton’s. The big difference is that George McMains, the lieutenant who handles firearms permits there, may have to investigate applicants ― by, for example, calling neighbors or family. That’s because, in a city whose population is just under 90,000, McMains is less likely than Czapala to know the applicant personally. McMains said investigating incident reports is especially important for revealing histories of domestic violence, because even repeated visits can result in no formal charges and, thus, no automatic disqualifications for gun ownership even under the unusually tight standards Massachusetts has in place.  It’s not surprising he would say that. In a 2013 survey, Massachusetts police departments said incidents of domestic violence were among the most likely reasons for them to restrict or deny a license, or to suspend one they had approved.  At the same time, McMains said, police officers work hard to distinguish between “somebody arrested for disorderly conduct when he was in college, on a Friday night, 15 years ago, versus somebody who has a record of being involved with domestic situations with his significant other.” McMains, who has been handling Newton’s permits for two years, says that is one reason every license rejection during his tenure has held up in court. “That goes to show that the chief does put a lot of thought into his denials,” McMains said.  Gun homicides and suicides still happen in Massachusetts, in part because people without licenses still manage to get guns. But gun violence happens a lot less frequently than it does in most states.  Adjusted for age and population, the gun fatality rate in Massachusetts for 2016 was the lowest in the U.S. And that’s how it’s been for most of the last 30 years, although sometimes another state, like Hawaii, ends up with a slightly lower rate.  Just how much that low rate has to do with the state’s gun laws is a matter of ongoing debate, even among experts. Pretty much any legitimate study is going to rely on assumptions that will be open to valid criticism; separating out cause and effect can be virtually impossible. But the available research provides a good reason to think Massachusetts laws in general and the permit system in particular have made violence less likely. Some of the most widely cited work, by Daniel Webster of Johns Hopkins University, has focused on two states that have had similar, albeit weaker, permit schemes: Missouri, which got rid of its license program a decade ago, and Connecticut, which added one in the 1990s. Using a variety of methods designed to estimate what might have happened if those states hadn’t changed their laws, Webster and his colleagues concluded that getting rid of gun licenses in Missouri led to more gun violence, while introducing licenses in Connecticut led to less. Additional research, including a study the Journal of Urban Health published last month, has shown that gun crimes in states with permit schemes tend to involve guns that criminals obtained more easily elsewhere.  That suggests the laws are at the very least forcing would-be perpetrators to change their behavior. It also suggests permit systems could have a bigger effect on violence if more states had them.  Police officials in Massachusetts make that argument all the time. “It’s crazy that some states just give out these guns with very few requirements,” William Evans, commissioner of the Boston police and a champion of tighter gun laws, said in an interview.  “We have tough gun laws here, and to me it makes a difference,” Evans said. “But if we had them nationally, if other states had universal background checks and strong licensing like our state does, there would be less violence.” The other big question about the Massachusetts system is the constitutional one. The Supreme Court, in a controversial 2008 ruling known as D.C. v. Heller, upheld the government’s ability to regulate firearm possession and usage. But it also recognized, for the first time, a constitutional right to gun ownership.  To Jim Wallace, executive director of the Gun Owners Action League and outspoken critic of Massachusetts regulations, the state’s licensing system clearly infringes on that right. “We always have to be careful about how much authority we give to law enforcement,” Wallace said. “Their jobs ― God bless them ― is to enforce the law, not decide on somebody’s civil rights.” Jason Guida, an attorney and former state firearms official who now represents people appealing license denials, has a similar view. “Once we go down the road of giving police discretion, we are not just stepping on the other side of that line, we are jumping over it and dancing.” Guida represents that man from Newton who is appealing his license denial, and he thinks the case is an example of how the law gives police too much authority. When the man wrote a letter requesting the gun permit, he addressed his history with police head-on, Guida noted. The incidents all occurred during a difficult period in his life, the man wrote, and since that time he has stayed dry, gotten a steady job and even done volunteer work at a local food bank. He also promised to use the gun lawfully, saying he wanted it only for bird hunting and target practice. “Most of my clients have never been convicted, never even been charged with a crime, but a chief has decided that they are not safe with firearms,” Guida said. “That’s the rub right here, how Massachusetts may have gone beyond what the Second Amendment allows.” Supporters of the Massachusetts law see things differently. Public safety is a constitutionally permissible reason for restricting gun ownership, they say, and local police are ideally situated to make that call, at least initially. “In the context of gun rights, where the Supreme Court has said limitations based on public safety principles are appropriate, we want law enforcement to make those decisions, because they are the ones on the ground, who see the behavior,” Hannah Shearer, a staff attorney at the Giffords Law Center, said. There is also the appeals process, which can serve as a safeguard for constitutional rights. Although police discretion over gun ownership can be “constitutionally problematic,” says Adam Winkler, a UCLA constitutional law professor, “if more than 90 percent of applicants are getting permits, there is an appeals process in place and government has to provide actual evidence that’s reviewed by a neutral arbiter, that seems to me a system that the courts might uphold.” “No right is absolute ― Heller makes that clear,” Winkler, who is the author of the book Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America, added. “If the question is ‘Should there be enough discretion to target certain behaviors that fall short of criminal conviction but are highly probative of danger from firearms?’ a court is likely to say that kind of review is acceptable.” In Washington, a handful of lawmakers have held up the Massachusetts system as a prototype for the rest of the country. One of them is the state’s junior Democratic senator, Ed Markey, who has sponsored a bill that would give states strong financial incentives to introduce their own licensing programs. “The involvement of police chiefs in the licensing process is key,” Markey said at a news conference in March, when he formally unveiled the proposal. “We can’t overstate that enough.” Democratic lawmakers from other states with their own variations on permit systems, including Connecticut, Maryland and New Jersey, have introduced similar measures. Those lawmakers have a lot of work to do. Gun violence is getting more political attention than at any time since 2013, and the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shootings, which not coincidentally is the last time Congress came close to passing meaningful gun legislation. And if the odds of enacting significant new measures now are long, they will improve if supporters of tighter gun laws win more seats in Congress, starting with this year’s midterm elections. But most of the focus so far has been on banning assault-style weapons or extending background checks to private sales, the two ideas that have gotten the most attention in the past. Although many experts believe these measures can also help, there’s reason to think that they would work best in combination with a full-fledged permit system that involved police discretion. State lawmakers in Massachusetts appear to agree. The state already has a ban on many assault-style weapons, and it already applies its laws to all sales, not just those that licensed dealers make. That’s actually one reason advocates think a permit system could win over some gun rights advocates. It spares private dealers the administrative hassle of performing background checks; all they have to do is check for the state-issued permit. Now many of the same lawmakers responsible for the 2014 law are looking to build on it. They are pushing for a “red flag” law in which family members could ask judges to issue emergency restraining orders when they fear a loved one is about to commit an act of violence. These orders would automatically suspend any existing gun licenses and allow police to seize weapons. Although this would be a separate policy from the permitting system, the underlying impulse is the same: to identify people likely to hurt themselves or others and keep guns out of their hands before it happens.

"Larry Nassar, the disgraced former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State team doctor, listened to more than a dozen of his sexual abuse victims read impact statements in an East Lansing, Michigan, court on Tuesday.  The sentencing hearing began at 9 on Tuesday morning and is set to run through Thursday afternoon. Nassar pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct in November. According to Michigan state Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis, 98 victims and family members of victims are scheduled to read impact statements over the week.  Many of the sexual abuse survivors who spoke in court on Tuesday had been named anonymously in lawsuits and came out publicly for the first time while making their statements. Almost all of them asked Judge Rosemarie Aquilina to sentence Nassar to a minimum of 40 years and a maximum of 125 years in prison, which is in line with the prosecutor’s request.  The morning started off with a riveting address from Kyle Stephens, a family friend of Nassar’s and the only known victim who was not an athlete or a dancer. Stephens said she was sexually abused by Nassar for years, starting when she was just 6.  “You used my body for six years for your own sexual gratification. That is unforgivable,” Stephens told Nassar. The young woman said Nassar’s abuse came between her and her parents when she tried to tell them about it. They didn’t believe her for years. Her father killed himself in 2016, Stephens said, after realizing she had not been lying.  “Had he not had to bear the shame and self-loathing that stemmed from his defense of Larry Nassar, he would have had a fighting chance,” she said, referring to her father’s suicide. Stephens looked directly at Nassar as she concluded on a powerful note: “Little girls don’t stay little forever. They turn into strong women that return to destroy your world.” ""Sexual abuse is so much more than a disturbing physical act. It changes the trajectory of a victim's life and that is something that no one has the right to do,"" one of Larry Nassar's victims tells court https://t.co/kuNqrRlYMc pic.twitter.com/cJRRIdALwZ Nassar has been accused by 140 women of serial sexual abuse during his past tenures as the team doctor for USA Gymnastics, the doctor for various Michigan State University sports teams and the sports medicine doctor at the Michigan gymnastics training gym Twistars. Of those women, 125 have filed lawsuits against Nassar, USA Gymnastics, MSU and Twistars.  Olivia Cowan, now married and a mother of two young daughters, was visibly emotional as she talked about the after-effects of Nassar’s abuse.  “This case has taken all of me, every ounce of my being, to press forward,” she said, adding later, “I will educate my children about monsters like you and pray to God they will never experience pain like this.”  Cowan also addressed MSU and USA Gymnastics, which have been accused of covering up the doctor’s behavior for two decades.  “It’s horrifying that MSU and USA Gymnastics are not stepping up to the plate to admit their wrongdoing. … I want MSU and USAG to know what they have done is on the very same level of accountability as the crime Nassar has committed,” Cowan said with tears streaming down her face. “MSU knew what was being done to these athletes and decided to turn a blind eye to keep their reputation strong and their pockets full. If they would have only taken action upon the first reporting, they would have saved me and all these other women standing before us today.” The university has denied hiding Nassar’s behavior in any way. “Any suggestion that the university covered up Nassar’s horrific conduct is simply false,” MSU spokesperson Jason Cody told HuffPost earlier this month. “Nassar preyed on his victims, changing their lives in terrible ways. As [MSU] President Simon has said, MSU is truly sorry for the abuse all victims suffered, the pain it caused, and the pain it still causes.” Cowan also brought up the news last month that former Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney was paid by USA Gymnastics to keep quiet about the abuse she endured at the hands of Nassar.  “Shame on you [USA Gymnastics] for looking the other way when this was brought to your attention,” Cowan said. “A public apology after you’ve hid behind this monster for over 20 years will never be enough. Where were you when we needed you? If you would have only listened to the women who brought complaints and concerns over all these years, this would have saved so many children and women from being abused and from all the scars this has created.”  In one of the most moving statements of the day, Donna Markham spoke on behalf of her daughter Chelsea, who was abused by Nassar.  “She never really recovered,” Markham said of her daughter, whom she described as her “best friend.”  “He was supposed to help her heal. But he didn’t do that. He abused her,” Markham told the court. “He had the audacity to do it while I was sitting in the room.” She went on to reveal why Chelsea wasn’t delivering this impact statement. “She took her own life because she couldn’t deal with the pain anymore,” Markham said. “It will be 10 years in March that I lost my baby. She was 23 years old. … Every day I miss her. Every day. And it all started with him.” Judge Aquilina repeated to every victim who spoke that the abuse they’d endured was not their fault.  “You are worthy,” she told survivor Danielle Moore. “This was done to you. It was not done by you.”  The judge assured the 17-year-old Jessica Thomashow that she will heal. “You talk about being broken. He’s going to break while you’re healing and I believe that he will remain broken,” she said.  In another powerful moment, survivor Kate Mahon quoted the writer Jasmin Kaur when she said: “Scream so that one day a hundred years from now, another sister will not have to dry her tears wondering where in history she lost her voice.” Mahon added that she came forward to speak on the behalf of all survivors of sexual abuse.  “By publicly speaking out against Larry Nassar, I’m not just speaking out for myself,” she said. “I’m speaking out for all the girls and women of the past, present and future that have been or will be affected by sexual assault.” Other survivors who spoke on Tuesday included Jade Capua and Alexis Moore.",she,said,friend
"Breaking up may be hard to do, but getting back together is near impossible, though Bill Nighy and Carey Mulligan give it a game try with searing performances in a spirited and caustic revival of Skylight, David Hare's one-night stand of lovers' recriminations. At the time of the play, the early 1990's, Kyra Hollis is living in squalid flat in a housing project from the 60's in the northern London ghetto district of Kensal Rise, teaching kids of welfare parents in a rough and rowdy school in East Ham. It was not always thus for Kyra.  As her story is teased out over the course of one cold and snowy night, she was for six years the live-in mistress of Tom Sergeant, a successful restauranteur, best friends with Tom's unsuspecting wife Alice, and surrogate big sister to his two children, a boy named Edward and his sister. Then one day Alice discovered the affair and Kyra left the next day. The lights come up on Kyra, superbly and subtly played by Mulligan, arriving home from another frustrating day in the classroom with a pile of blue books to grade and a couple of  bags of groceries. To her surprise she is followed in by Edward, now 18, whom she has not seen since she walked out on his dad three years ago. Edward has brought Kyra some beer and several CD's of the new rap music that is becoming so popular, and through a ferocious and strained diatribe against his father, during which it is learned that Alice died a year ago, manages to get out the one question he wants to ask Kyra after all these years: ""Why did you leave?"" Kyra evades it with the aplomb of a politician.  No sooner has she seen Edward out the door than her buzzer frantically rings. This time it is Tom himself, in an intense and energetic performance by Nighy, and he arrives with a bottle of Scotch and a swagger. He has some questions of his own, though he may not like Kyra's answers. Hare is one of the theater's more literate writers and Skylight is almost a staged debate on issues ranging from socio-economics to the welfare state to what was once called the generation gap, and he gives each side its point and counterpoint. The dialogue is brimming with wit and passion and full of clever lines everyone wishes he or she could come up with in the heat of argument. But at the heart of Skylight is the nature of love and the foundation on which it must be built if it is to last.  The structure of the play is like that of a Romantic sonata, scored mainly for cello and violin but with a viola in the first and last movements. Even the direction of this new staging could have musical notations in the margin. Stephen Daldry, the brilliant director who now has two plays running next door to each other on 45th Street (the other being The Audience with Helen Mirren), raises and lowers the tempo from scene to scene - furioso in Nighy's lengthy outbursts to adagio in Mulligan's and Nighy's reminisces. Even the volume ranges from fortissimo to pianissimo as their quarrels wax and wane.  There are some incongruities in Skylight. Tom's daughter, whose bicycle accident provided the catalyst for Kyra joining the family, is hardly mentioned again. It is certainly convenient that Krya has not acquired a boyfriend or even much in the way of friends in the three years since her break-up with Tom, and the timing of Edward's and Tom's visit on the same night is dramatically expedient if not entirely credible. But Daldry's cast makes one forget, or at least overlook, such problems.  Mulligan is in full control of her character from her first entrance, sniffling and blotting her nose from the cold. She is polite but cautious when she finds Edward in her flat, almost nonchalant as she listens to him rant about his dad and her former lover. She is even more circumspect when Tom shows up. In Mulligan's performance it is easy to see why Tom would want Kyra back, and she makes it easy to understand why Kyra finds a vocation in teaching kids who have little hope. Nighy is like a caged animal as Tom, pacing Kyra's flat as he delivers one tirade after another against whatever pops into his mind. No one does glib with quite the panache as Nighy, nor can anyone be sarcastic with quite as much charm. He even pronounces the final ""e"" of his words. Nighy has one bit of business in pulling a chair out from under a table with his foot and then pushing it back in that virtually defines his character. It's a gesture that Mulligan brilliantly parodies later in the play.      Matthew Beard is excellent as Edward, turning a role that basically serves at the start as provider of background information into a sensitive young man for whom one immediately feels pity. He races through the opening scene like he was on speed, but by the end the audience knows he is a troubled adolescent in need of love, something he is not going to get from his father. Bob Crowley's design, including a dismal flat with a two-gallon, wall-mounted water heater and a tiny four-hob cooker (on which Mulligan whips up a great-smelling spaghetti sauce) adds to the sense of futility that hangs over the play. There is even a small space heater much like the one Queen Elizabeth has at Balmoral in The Audience next door. It doesn't give off much heat, but Mulligan and Nighy make up for that.",Mulligan,give,that

Read Episode Thirty-Four: Finished!. Or, start at the beginning: An Illness's Introduction. Find all episodes here. After the thrill of seeing Hadley's murals on the walls of the Montana State Capital building, coming home to my novel that was growing roots in a file on my laptop was hard. The disappointment I felt in myself was directly proportional to the admiration I felt for Hadley. It was impossible not to compare our trajectories. Hadley, plagued as she'd been with serious health issues all her life, had turned out many notable projects in her 38 years, culminating in a historic, grand-scale commission. Here I was, on the verge of 60, and I hadn't managed to get Dream House, the project that most mattered to me, out into the world. I'd witnessed Hadley's deep satisfaction, unveiling the strongest and most celebrated work of her life. I wanted that! The week following my trip to Montana, I attended a rousing orchestral performance. I found myself imagining a violinist playing her instrument in her room for years on end with no clear prospect of ever being heard. An absurd notion, as music is meant to be listened to. We don't think of writing as a performing art. But like musicians, writers work assiduoaulsy to craft an affecting expression of their ideas and stories in order to touch an audience with their words. Writers, I glumly mused as the orchestra played on, can write for years without having their work read. Away doom and gloom! I couldn't let my discouragement quash my determination. I began making inquiries about self-publishing. I had no well-considered bias against this route to publication; I just didn't feel I had the stamina it takes to make it happen. No sooner had I begun my research, than an email popped up that made my heart gallop. Jay, my Dream House editor, had a colleague who was interested in publishing the book. It was tempting to get carried away by the excitement of this news. But I didn't share it even with my husband, Lewis, because the only thing worse than riding the rollercoaster of publication hopefulness that had begun four years earlier was taking those closest to me along for the ride. Two weeks after Hadley's mural unveiling, in a state of suspended belief, I drove downtown to meet with Lisa McGuinness, publisher at Yellow Pear Press. We hit it off and right then and there, nailed down details and deadlines to meet for publishing in the fall, November 2015.  Within eight weeks of my meeting with Lisa, my novel had a cover and I was proofreading the galleys. Every week, I let the new reality sink in a little more, but I still felt unable to celebrate. In part, this was because publishing had been a dream for so long that it felt too good to be true. Also, with many hands involved in its production, I fretted about whether the physical book would have the qualities I hoped for. And then there was the obvious: apprehension about how the novel would be received. Another reason I felt excitement bubbling up only at discreet moments was not related to anxieties about my novel, but rather, what was happening in my day-to-day, i.e., life, which goes on despite the alternate realities our work sometimes constructs for us. Sylvia, after a short remission, was not winning her fight with cancer. The July ablation she'd had on the small lesion on her liver appeared to trigger an inflammatory response, resulting in a new proliferation of cancer cells. By February, she was housebound, except when she needed to see her doctor, and was spending much of her days sleeping. One Saturday evening in mid-March, the water heater on the second floor of her house began leaking through the floor. The plumber who came on Monday used a blowtorch too close to a fire sprinkler in the water heater closet, setting off a monsoon in the house. Sylvia's daughter, Meredith, home at the time, called 911 and me. Then, she led her bathrobed mother down into the street and helped her and their dog into their parked car. When I arrived, there was mayhem: two fire trucks, water everywhere, my stunned, sliver of a friend sitting in the car out front. I drove her to my house and set her up in bed. Sylvia, her husband Peter, Meredith, and their Golden Retriever stayed with us for a week while their house dried out. It was profoundly affecting to witness the tender, complicated care Peter and Meredith gave Sylvia, and to have one of my dearest friends under my roof at the end of her life. When she was sleeping, I tried to carry on with the daily tasks that were moving my book forward, but my awareness of Sylvia's ephemerality kept me in the present moment. I didn't want to miss something important. I savored the times she asked me to help shift her tiny frame in the bed, each brief conversation we shared. ""I don't want to keep going like this,"" she told me one day. We talked about what's within a patient's power when they are ready to stop suffering and say goodbye. What could be more important, and yet how many times in life do we get the chance to talk this way with someone we love? One morning when we were chatting, she looked deep in thought for a few moments and I braced myself for something difficult. Finally, she said, ""I probably won't be able to eat it, but just in case, can you save me some of the Bolognese sauce you made for dinner?"" She laughed. She was such a foodie. She'd been eating Gerber baby arrowroot biscuits, mashed potatoes and ground chicken for days; no wonder she craved some zest! That week, I barely thought about Parkinson's, which felt like a mere annoyance. But I thought a lot about what awaits me and everyone close to me at the end of our lives. During Sylvia's stay, I talked to Hadley and she recalled her last days with her stepfather, Charlie. Our conversation about dying was disorienting, as if I were looking through a camera lens at the four of us -- Hadley, Sylvia, Charlie, and myself -- trying to adjust the focal length to correspond with our (unspoken) perceptions of where we were on the timelines of our lives. In late March, I sat on Sylvia's bed in the bright California sunshine streaming through the windows. She was waifish, every bone explicit. Always meticulously groomed, she worried aloud about how long her fingernails had grown and I asked her if she'd like me to cut them. Sylvia was a private person, and I felt honored when she said yes. As I held each of her cool, delicate fingers in my hand and clipped, I took my time, relishing the intimacy of this simple task, taking it in as Sylvia's last gift to me. She died several days later with Peter and Meredith by her side. Winter and spring were a blur of proofreading the Dream House galleys -- every word and punctuation mark, six times (by the time the book went to print, I probably could've told you to pick a word, any word, and I would've been able to turn to the page where it was written)--and pulling together promotional material at the behest of the publicist. Among other things, this included setting up an author Facebook page and a website, which I was lucky enough to have our son, Tobias, design. I learned how to describe the book in as few, hopefully enticing, phrases as possible: ""An architect of houses searching for home,"" ""...how we shape and are shaped by our houses,"" ""What makes a house feel like home?"" As tedious as the production period was at times, after years of editing Dream House with nothing but hope and encouragement to keep me motivated, I gobbled up the tasks before me, knowing that there would be a monumental payoff. Finally, I was able to put to bed all my sad feelings that are best described by the old question, ""If a tree falls in a forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?"" In July, Lisa met me for lunch to present my printed book. When she passed it across the table, I was unprepared for the emotional rush that sent me diving for my napkin to brush away tears. To me, the book was an exquisite object. The quiet but evocative jacket featuring an image of the Maine house where I was raised perfectly captures the tone and landscape of the novel; the size and weight of the book is modest but inviting. I hadn't dared to hope the physical embodiment of my story and the story itself, in which I explored everything that most moved me: space and architecture, love and motherhood, pain and healing, ocean, sky and trees, would be so well integrated, so...right. A week before the book's publishing date, in late October 2015, we threw a party. I dubbed it the ""If not now, when?"" party. I'd been casting about for an excuse to have a very big party for years and a book event seemed more fun than waiting for a milestone birthday, which, especially when you have a progressive, degenerative disease, is not necessarily a cause for celebration. The party was a blast. Local friends and my neurologist came. Friends from the other coast as well as our daughter Elena, my sisters, their husbands and some of their offspring flew in. Tobias's band played and I danced with the freewheeling women in my writing group. Lisa set up a bookselling table and friends generously stood in line to purchase books and have me sign them. While turning my Sharpie loose on book after book, it finally became real to me: my book! Did I have Parkinson's? Not that night! I spoke into a microphone for the first time in my life. I was nervous, since presenting to groups has never been easy for me, but being in that crowd of well-wishers was like soaking in a warm bath.

From November through April, I talked about Dream House in the west and in New England at bookstores, private parties, newspaper and radio interviews, seven book groups and an architecture school. Awesome family and friends from around the country facilitated opportunities for me to speak and sell books. Mindful of my energy's ebb and flow, I only scheduled events where I knew people who would fill the chairs.

I never stopped feeling nervous when approaching the podium, afraid I'd go blank in the middle of a thought. I did a couple of times, but managed to recover well enough. After describing the inspirations for the novel, I would read a couple of passages and feel my anxiety drop away. Speaking the words I'd written, I re-experienced the passion I'd felt when I started the book years ago. It was powerful to feel I was engaging my listeners' emotions and imagination, not by selling plot or drama but simply through my choice and arrangement of words. Finally, I was out of my room, playing my music. People were listening.

I didn't push much beyond my limitations to publicize Dream House, so the post-publication experience was entirely positive. Even at the event in my hometown, 3000 miles away, where I feared God-knows-who would surface to scold me with a wagging finger for airing my family's troubles, people were warm, inquisitive and even a little proud of their homie author. In addition to old family friends I hadn't seen in decades, two of my first childhood girlfriends were in that room, as well as my first love; their presence added a distracting tenderness to the occasion. Everywhere I went, I filled with gratitude for people's inquisitiveness, enthusiasm, and their persistent pursuit of literature. That Lewis was the best roadie ever made all the difference. It was as if he'd read a manual on how to support your Parkie wife while she's on a book tour. He hefted my carryon into the overhead bin. Took my hand in the airport when he saw my leg dragging. Schlepped boxes of books and ran peoples' credit cards at private events. While at our Airbnb, he dashed to the market for groceries, made me coffee every morning and, in the evenings before my book talks, a mini margarita to boost my confidence. (Trust me; it works.) Each day, he rode a bike for an hour and a half but insisted he wasn't too tired to go back out and take a three mile walk with me, because he knows that exercise is what keeps my body from shutting down altogether. He was excited to greet the wonderful old friends who came out of the woodwork. Throughout the ""season of Dream House,"" Lewis expressed no complaints. He had lost his partner in architecture years before, but was now proud to crow about her book to anyone who'd listen. He was thrilled for me, but also, like many partners of those with debilitating conditions, he understands the importance of turning up the light on life's joyful passages and significant accomplishments. So, how did it feel to finally be published at 60? Besides joy, another feeling: relief when I finished my book tour. Taking stock of my Parkinson's progression, I had a sense that publication came not a moment -- or at least year -- too soon. Also a relief was to be done with the story that had been parked in my brain like a giant RV full of claustrophobic family members, and to clear out my cabinet filled with paper drafts, some dating back to the late 20th century. I could move on. Parkinson's added to my life a new community of friends like Hadley with whom I can share the experience of our disease. The release of Dream House provided another avenue for making meaningful connections. Friends and total strangers have written to me about why they resonated with the novel; the territories that I'd burned to explore ignited in them vivid memories and powerful emotions. I've felt honored and delighted that they've shared, sometimes in intimate detail, tales of their complicated relationships with a house, with a parent, or their children. This -- touching the hearts and minds of my readers and in return, being moved by their stories -- was the least expected but greatest reward of realizing my long-time dream.

"As an Atlanta resident, I LOVE Delta Airlines. As a corporate trainer however, I cringe at some of their recent leadership missteps. Several weeks ago, they received tons of negative press over a nightmarish spring break travel season fraught with extensive customer delays, thousands of flight cancellations and arguably poor management decisions. As a corporate trainer who advises leaders and teams on a wide range of issues and also one of those unlucky Delta spring break passengers, I felt moved to write an article “I’m Sorry….the Two Tragically Forgotten Words in Customer Service”. The article essentially asserts that to avoid apologizing when a company has clearly dropped the ball, only makes the situation worse. Unfortunately, the article seemed to foreshadow even darker days for the airline industry. Just a few days later, I watched in horror as the United Airlines video surfaced showing a seemingly harmless paying customer being dragged off a flight in order to make room for United flight crew in accordance with their (controversial at best) “policy”. Instead of issuing an immediate apology, top executives’ initial statements seemed to blame the customer and show complete support for United crew who were simply “following policy” according to executives. Hearing the executives’ misguided, defensive response, I tweeted out my article with #United Airlines….”United Executives, please read…” because I felt it was so relevant to their current situation. Arguably, the worldwide media firestorm about the United debacle diverted the attention from Delta’s missteps. My prayer was that Delta would take advantage of the “reprieve” and take copious notes on what not to do as they watched the United drama unfold. Boy, was I wrong! This morning, my jaw dropped to the floor as I watched video of what appeared to be a typical easy going Delta customer being kicked off a plane – not because he made terroristic threats, not because he was violent or belligerent with another passenger or crew member, not because he was intoxicated and causing a disturbance….no, because he decided that he couldn’t hold it anymore during the tarmac delay and decided to quickly run to the restroom (even though he’d asked permission 30 minutes earlier and been denied). Their justification for turning the plane around and forcing everyone to disembark? He did not comply with crew instructions. In ABC News’ recount of the incident, fellow passenger attorney Krista Rosolino (who recorded the video) described the incident as “the most outrageous treatment of a paying customer I’ve ever seen.” She further described her outrage in an open letter to Delta Airlines. As a huge believer in learning from other’s mistakes, I’d like to share three key principles Delta should have learned from the United fiasco: Apply the Common Sense Filter to All Policies It’s amazing to me that these executives in their formal responses cling to their own internal policies absolutely seemingly with little focus on critical analysis of the specific situation. Just as I’m sure virtually everyone would agree that policies are absolutely necessary and expecting passengers to follow crew member instructions is completely reasonable (if not necessary), but virtually any policy must be considered in context (and there are almost always exceptions). In this situation, I can’t help but ask what ifs…..What if a young pregnant woman had asked to use the restroom? What if an elderly person with a medical condition or a young child needed to use the restroom? It’s hard to imagine that those situations would not have (and should not have) played out differently. Certainly there have also been rare instances of crew members being impaired or otherwise making very poor choices (e.g. the American Airlines crew member who just days ago reportedly became quite aggressive with a mother holding a baby). Assuming crew aren’t perfect, there’s always the possibility that they could give an instruction that could jeopardize safety – should those be blindly adhered to as well? Blind allegiance to policy at the expense of basic common sense is a recipe for disaster. Don’t Overreact in a Conflict Situation The United example seems to provide a lesson on the dangers of overreacting in a conflict situation. Instead of deescalating when possible, it seemed that the focus was escalation if not domination and clearly the situation spiraled out of control. The lesson here – accept that there will be policy violations – expect them as a part of doing business and seek the path of de-escalation whenever possible. Always Consider the Worst Case Scenario One technique for avoiding the temptation to overreact is to first think through the worst case result (e.g. the recent United Airlines disaster where the customer was dragged down the aisle). I can’t imagine the backlash that Delta will receive having a video circulating that recounts them not just humiliating this one passenger but also choosing to seriously inconvenience the entire plane full of passengers unnecessarily by making everyone disembark and reboard so they could flex their authority and “force him off the plane”. I just can’t understand how they didn’t weigh the public relations risk either at the flight attendant level (making the initial decision), managerial level (deciding to turn the plane around) or the executive level (issuing a statement blindly citing policy with no apology in sight). Like any other major corporation, Delta can’t control all its employees actions, but their doubling down on this ridiculous series of decisions makes them appear tone deaf at best (and that’s generous). I can’t help but think that if SNL does a skit showing crew members passing out Depend undergarments as they board, they only have themselves to blame.

"Minority faith communities are undergoing great stress in today’s America. Over the past several months, Jewish cemeteries, synagogues, and even a Jewish museum have been vandalized across the country, while Jewish community centers have received a litany of bomb threats. One rabbi in Seattle, whose synagogue of 16 years was graffitied with such slogans as, “Holocaust is fake history,” remarked, “in my time, there’s been nothing like this.” Meanwhile, a number of mosques across the country, from Colorado to Michigan, have been threatened, vandalized, and even torched. Mosques across the country are now even being advised to set up security cameras and hire security guards in response to this disturbing trend. In the same vein, an active-shooter training was recently held in a suburban Baltimore mosque in response to these incidents. Clearly we are barreling down a slippery slope that can only end in disaster if it is unchecked at the highest levels of our society. Though while the picture may be bleak for minorities across the country, not all hope is lost for our nation’s diverse faiths. In the face of this tension, fear, and angst, an interfaith spirit persists in many corners of America. It was in this light that on Friday, March 24, Ambassador Akbar Ahmed, the Ibn Khaldun Chair of Islamic Studies at American University, was invited to address Congregation B’nai Tzedek in Potomac, Md. as the synagogue’s first-ever Muslim speaker. Congregation B’nai Tzedek, a prominent Montgomery County Conservative synagogue, is led by founder Rabbi Stuart Weinblatt, who is also the current President of the Rabbinic Cabinet of the Jewish Federations of North America, “the central address of North American Jewry.” Following a lively Friday evening service and dinner of of challah, chicken, couscous, and salad to welcome the Shabbat, the Jewish sabbath, Weinblatt opened the lecture with a very warm introduction of his “friend” of one year, Ahmed, whom he described as a “gentleman” with a “kind heart.” Ahmed reciprocated this embracing introduction, telling of his admiration for Weinblatt and for their mutual friend, American University supporter and B’nai Tzedek congregant, Gary Berman, who introduced these two moral leaders to one another and played a key role in facilitating this Shabbat dinner lecture. Ahmed’s multifaceted lecture on the Jewish-Muslim relationship began with a reflection on his dialogue series with Dr. Judea Pearl in the early 2000s, pursued in the wake of the vicious murder of Pearl’s son, Danny Pearl, in Karachi, Ahmed’s hometown. Having made a global impact, with high-profile lecture events being held across the US, Canada, and Europe, Ahmed said the lecture series was a huge success in demonstrating to diverse communities how these faith bridges can be successfully built. Ahmed also recounted how the two would travel to college campuses and other areas of high Jewish-Muslim tension and work with the communities to facilitate dialogue and understanding between the faiths. Ahmed then sought to expand the congregation’s conception of the Muslim world, explaining that Muslim societies can be understood through three lenses: literalist, mystic, and modernist. Whereas the literalists seek to follow the life of the Prophet to a T, Ahmed explained that the mystics focus on a very spiritual vision of the faith, while the modernists strive to both live in the world as it stands and to live out the traditions of their Islamic faith. He explained how Americans, Israelis, and many other Westerners tend to only be familiar with the extremist subset of literalist Muslims, which negatively informs Western policy and attitudes towards the Muslim world, and argued that this exclusive focus on a subset of Muslims must be countered for successful relations to flourish between Muslim and non-Muslim communities. He elaborated that by only focusing on the extremist literalists, such as terrorist groups that seek to get their message across through bombs rather than books, Western leaders of all faiths are actually elevating the extremists’ marginal role in the Muslim world at the expense of the mystics and modernists. An optimist at his core, Ahmed reminded the audience of the positive signs he is seeing in the Jewish-Muslim relationship. He recounted how Ambassador Jakob Finci, the head of the Jewish community in Bosnia, explained to him while he conducted fieldwork for his Journey into Europe project that anti-Semitism simply does not exist in Bosnia, a majority-Muslim European nation. Given the resurgence of anti-Semitism we are seeing in Europe and around the globe, this fact was remarkable to learn and demonstrated that peace and harmony between the faiths can be a lived reality in the 21st Century. Ahmed also told of his bridge-building work with Rabbi Julia Neuberger in writing the first-ever report on anti-Semitism, commissioned by the Runnymede Trust in the early 1990s, titled, A Very Light Sleeper. He discussed how, having just arrived in the U.K. from Pakistan, he had not yet learned much about the Jewish community, but he came into the project with a strong desire to work with the community given their common descent from Abraham. Through this work, he began to confront the horrific history of anti-Semitism that has plagued the Jewish people for millennia. As the project progressed, Ahmed also began drawing parallels to the Muslim experience, reflecting on the proliferation of attacks on mosques and synagogues alike and the women in hijab who were constantly being assaulted. Following the completion of this eye-opening and impactful project, Ahmed realized that anti-Muslim discrimination in West, just like anti-Semitism, now needed to be addressed head-on. This led Ahmed to collaborate with Neuberger and the entire Runnymede Trust once again and produce the report, Islamophobia: A Challenge For Us All, which actually coined the term, Islamophobia. However, in a cautionary note for the audience, Ahmed told of how his experience on the Runnymede Trust also solidified for him the slippery slope theory of prejudice - once one minority is targeted by discrimination and prejudice, it is only a matter of time before all minority communities will be targeted by this distaste for the “Other.” Ahmed found through studying the history and interconnectedness of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia that should discrimination against any minority group continue unabated, it will slide down a slippery slope that logically can only end at the gates of Dachau and Auschwitz. This is why Ahmed argued that everyone, whether, Jewish, Muslim, or otherwise, must become committed to the Jewish mantra of Tikkun Olam, or “to heal a fractured world.” This is the only way humanity can be saved from itself. The question and answer session quickly lit up with deep questions and debates surrounding Jewish-Muslim relations, particularly within the frame of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Several asked about how one could go about fostering better relations between Israel and Palestine. Ahmed responded by emphasizing that, as discussed in his lecture, the Jewish community needs to reach out and understand the core features of Islam and avoid seeing it in stereotypes. By reducing the Muslim world to mere stereotypes, he explained, it becomes nearly impossible for the Jewish community and all non-Muslims reach out and build bridges. Ahmed added that we all need to aim for a world in which all Israeli Jews and Palestinian Muslims can live with respect, peace, harmony, prosperity, and security, so as to allow both communities and all humanity to thrive. Several also asked about why, as they perceived, other modernist Muslims were not out there speaking out. He responded forcefully by telling of Malala Yousafzai, his daughter, Dr. Amineh Hoti, and journalist, Raza Rumi, who was nearly assassinated by extremists in Pakistan, as three of thousands of examples of modernist Muslims fighting for a peaceful, inclusive future in the Muslim world. He also explained that those who are not aware of modernist Muslims out there fighting every day simply need to open their eyes to the Muslims who are living, working, writing, and speaking all around them. The lecture clearly had a strong impact on the community. Afterwards, many community members came up to Ahmed to discuss his points and ask how they can work to advance interfaith bridge building, with some recounting their own experiences in bridge building to him. One man at the end of the program, after having a brief argument with Ahmed during the question and answer session, even came up to Ahmed in a sign of warm embrace with several slices of the cake just to ensure he had a chance to enjoy dessert as he mingled among the congregants. Since Trump’s inauguration, many Americans, particularly those in minority communities, have felt besieged by forces of intolerance. There is a great deal of fear and angst in communities all across the country. Yet, in these past two months, Ahmed, as a Muslim, and I, as a Christian, traveling together, have received nothing but the finest hospitality from houses of worship around Greater Washington. Since January 20 alone, I’ve joined Ahmed for church lectures, a visit to D.C.’s leading African-American mosque, where the director himself received us, Jummah prayers at the Islamic Center of Washington, where we were also received by the director, and now Shabbat dinner at a leading Conservative synagogue. It has become clear in our travels that Americans of all faiths remain committed to embracing one another and establishing dialogue and friendship, even in these tense times. This is the American spirit and the Abrahamic spirit at work, and for our country to begin healing these deep divides, we must begin to embrace this spirit in all aspects of our lives once again.",spirit,persists,America
"The monster of economic waste — over $7 trillion of dictated stock buybacks since 2003 by the self-enriching CEOs of large corporations — started with a little noticed change in 1982 by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under President Ronald Reagan. That was when SEC Chairman John Shad, a former Wall Street CEO, redefined unlawful ‘stock manipulation’ to exclude stock buybacks. Then after Clinton pushed through congress a $1 million cap on CEO pay that could be deductible, CEO compensation consultants wanted much of CEO pay to reflect the price of the company’s stock. The stock buyback mania was unleashed. Its core was not to benefit shareholders (other than perhaps hedge fund speculators) by improving the earnings per share ratio. Its real motivation was to increase CEO pay no matter how badly such burning out of shareholder dollars hurt the company, its workers and the overall pace of economic growth. In a massive conflict of interest between greedy top corporate executives and their own company, CEO-driven stock buybacks extract capital from corporations instead of contributing capital for corporate needs, as the capitalist theory would dictate. Yes, due to the malicious, toady SEC “business judgement” rule, CEOs can take trillions of dollars away from productive pursuits without even having to ask the companies’ owners — the shareholders — for approval. What could competent management have done with this treasure trove of shareholder money which came originally from consumer purchases? They could have invested more in research and development, in productive plant and equipment, in raising worker pay (and thereby consumer demand), in shoring up shaky pension fund reserves, or increasing dividends to shareholders. The leading expert on this subject — economics professor William Lazonick of the University of Massachusetts — wrote a widely read article in 2013 in the Harvard Business Review titled “Profits Without Prosperity” documenting the intricate ways CEOs use buybacks to escalate their pay up to 300 to 500 times (averaging over $10,000 an hour plus lavish benefits) the average pay of their workers. This compared to only 30 times the average pay gap in 1978. This has led to increasing inequality and stagnant middle class wages. To make matters worse, companies with excessive stock buybacks experience a declining market value. A study by Professor Robert Ayres and Executive Fellow Michael Olenick at INSEAD (September 2017) provided data about IBM, which since 2005 has spent $125 billion on buybacks while laying off large numbers of workers and investing only $69.9 billion in R&D. IBM is widely viewed as a declining company that has lost out to more nimble competitors in Silicon Valley. The authors also cite General Electric, which in the same period spent $114.6 billion on its own stock only to see its stock price steadily decline in a bull market. In a review of 64 companies, including major retailers such as JC Penny and Macy’s, these firms spent more dollars in stock buybacks “than their businesses are currently worth in market value”! On the other hand, Ayes and Olenick analyzed 269 companies that “repurchased stock valued at 2 percent or less of their current market value (including Facebook, Xcel Energy, Berkshire Hathaway and Amazon). They were strong market performers. The scholars concluded that “Buybacks are a way of disinvesting – we call it ‘committing corporate suicide’ — in a way that rewards the “activists” (e.g. Hedge Funds) and executives, but hurts employees and pensioners.” Presently, hordes of corporate lobbyists are descending on Washington to demand deregulation and tax cuts. Why, you ask them? In order to conserve corporate money for investing in economic growth, they assert. Really?! Why, then, are they turning around and wasting far more money on stock buybacks, which produce no tangible value? The answer is clear: uncontrolled executive greed! By now you may be asking, why don’t the corporate bosses simply give more dividends to shareholders instead of buybacks, since a steady high dividend yield usually protects the price of the shares? Because these executives have far more of their compensation package in manipulated stock options and incentive payments than they own in stock. Walmart in recent years has bought back over $50 billion of its shares – a move benefiting the Walton family’s wealth – while saying it could not afford to increase the meager pay for over one million of their workers in the US. Last year the company bought back $8.3 billion of their stock which could have given their hard-pressed employees, many of whom are on welfare, a several thousand dollar raise. The corporate giants are also demanding that Congress allow the repatriation of about $2.5 trillion stashed abroad without paying more than 5% tax. They say the money would be used to grow the economy and create jobs. Last time CEOs promised this result in 2004, Congress approved, and then was double-crossed. The companies spent the bulk on stock buybacks, their own pay raises and some dividend increases. There are more shenanigans. With low interest rates that are deductible, companies actually borrow money to finance their stock buybacks. If the stock market tanks, these companies will have a self-created debt load to handle. A former Citigroup executive, Richard Parsons, has expressed worry about a “massively manipulated” stock market which “scares the crap” out of him. Banks that pay you near zero interest on your savings announced on June 28, 2017 the biggest single buyback in history – a $92.8 billion extraction. Drug companies say their sky-high drug prices are needed to fund R&D. But between 2006 and 2017, 18 drug company CEOs spent a combined staggering $516 billion on buybacks and dividends – more than their inflated claims of spending for R&D. Mr. Olenick says “When managers can’t create value in the business other than buying their own stock, it seems like it’s time for a management change.” Who’s going to do that? Shareholders stripped of inside power to control the company they own? No way. It will take Congressional hearings, a robust media focus, and the political clout of large pension and mutual funds to get the reforms under way. When I asked Robert Monks, an author and longtime expert on corporate governance, about his reaction to CEOs heavy with stock buybacks, he replied that the management was either unimaginative, incompetent or avaricious – or all of these. Essentially burning trillions of dollars for the hyper enrichment of a handful of radical corporate state supremacists wasn’t what classical capitalism was supposed to be about.",which,done,purchases
"In Hallencourt, where writer Édouard Louis grew up, the word “violence” is seldom used. Which isn’t to say it’s a peaceful, idyllic place. There may be the ostensible benefits of the countryside; the surrounding area may be lively and green. But the town ― which, in France’s recent presidential race, favored the Trump-esque Marine Le Pen ― is marked by its gendered social values. Louis ― born Eddy Bellegueule ― writes in his novel The End of Eddy that he was chastised and bullied for his “affected” voice from a young age. His father and eldest brother were both drinkers and fighters. Like most men in Hallencourt, his father dropped out of high school to work at a factory, but was unable to continue his work due to an injured back. The author flatly recounts memories of his father, who would murder litters of kittens and brawl for sport. Louis, meanwhile, took pleasure in trying on women’s clothes, and devised excuses for skipping out on soccer practice. Louis’s parents, and others in town, eventually came to accept his queerness just as they conceded the personhood of the only black person they knew in town. But acceptance came with a stipulation, a rationalization: we like you because you’re not like the others. Being not like the others meant being tough. In Hallencourt, toughness was the highest virtue. It meant doing backbreaking work. It meant, in Louis’ case, not flinching when a classmate hocked a phlegmy wad of spit onto his face. Louis is gifted at limning visceral descriptions of squalor. His want to not allow doctors to cede control of his body, and his resulting choice to spray a tetanus-blackened foot with perfume; his dust-covered and smoke-filled home, made worse by having asthma; his dad’s proclivity for fixing up old TV’s, and demanding that the family watch together in silence over dinner. The psychological insights he culls from these experiences are poignant. His mother’s tendency to declare that she’s “not a lady,” the habit both kids and adults in town had of laughing at the pain of others, as though laughter conveyed strength of character. Of being bullied at school, Louis writes, “They laughed when my face began to turn purple from lack of oxygen (a natural response from working-class people, the simplicity of those who possess little and enjoy laughing, who know how to have a good time).” On the town’s rampant racism, Louis’ takeaways run the risk of being facile. “There is a will that exists, a desperate, constantly renewed effort to place some people on a level below you,” he explains plainly. Still, the writer’s emotional tenor and clear-sightedness make this a must-read for anyone looking to learn more about class in the West, and how it weighs on the state of politics. The bottom line A touching story that’s artfully told, The End of Eddy will both make you want to turn away ― the descriptions of violence are that rich, and sensate ― and continue on with its frank and generous author. Who wrote it Édouard Louis, aka Eddy Bellegueule, is the author of two novels. Michael Lucey, the book’s translator, is a professor of French literature at the University of California, Berkeley. Who will read it Anyone interested in the burgeoning subgenre of autofiction, or in stories about class, masculinity, and growing up queer. What other reviewers think Slate: “Coming to terms with his childhood has resulted in this stark and honest image of French working class society, rendered in an authentic voice.” Washington Post: “What is most impressive about The End of Eddy is that its author turned himself into a man capable of creating such a vivid and honest self-portrait.” Opening lines “From my childhood I have no happy memories. I don’t mean to say that I never, in all those years, felt any happiness or joy. But suffering is all-consuming: it somehow gets rid of anything that doesn’t fit into its system.” Notable passage “The truth was that the display of all these bits of flesh was driving me crazy. I was using words like fags, fairies, queers to keep my distance from them. I used these words against the others in the hope that they would stop invading every inch of my body.” The End of EddyÉdouard LouisFarrar, Straus and Giroux, $23.00May 2 The Bottom Line is a weekly review combining plot description and analysis with fun tidbits about the book.",author,Post,portrait
"The descendant of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, Rev. Robert Lee IV, has left the Bethany United Church of Christ after receiving backlash for his denouncement of white supremacy at the MTV Video Music Awards last week. On Monday, an open letter by Lee describing the events that unfolded after his speech was published on a website for the Auburn Seminary. In the piece, Lee wrote that some members of the church “were concerned” about his speech and that the attention it brought to the church wasn’t desired. “My presence at the church as a descendent of Robert E. Lee and an outspoken opponent of white supremacy had already attracted attention, but with my appearance on MTV the media’s focus on my church reached an all time high,” he wrote. “A faction of church members were concerned about my speech and that I lifted up Black Lives Matter movement, the Women’ s March, and Heather Heyer as examples of racial justice work.” He went on to say that “the church’s reaction was deeply hurtful” to him. The 24-year-old pastor had served the North Carolina church for just six months and says he doesn’t want “this episode to be a distraction from the sacred work of confronting white supremacy in all its forms.” Adding: “My calling and my vocation has led me to speak out against violence and oppression in any form, and I want to especially challenge white Christians in America to take seriously the deadly legacy of slavery in our country and commit ourselves to follow Jesus into a time of deep reflection, repentance and reconciliation.” At the VMA’s, the fourth-great-nephew of Robert E. Lee introduced Susan Bro ― the mother of slain Charlottesville counter protester, Heather Heyer ― and said it was his “duty to speak out against racism, America’s original sin,” and advocated for viewers to “confront racism and white supremacy head on.”  Since Lee cut ties with the church, he’s been vocal on social media, expressing thanks to supporters and sharing his thoughts on speaking out: If we all used what we had to speak up, no matter how large or small. I think this world would be a better place. https://t.co/ia5Rlz5Oxc Lee ended his open letter by saying he is “looking forward with great hope to what God’s unfolding future and what God has in store for me and ask for all of your prayers and blessings for the future of my ministry.” Following white supremacist rallies in Charlottesville, Va., Lee told HuffPost that he was deeply troubled by the actions taken in his family’s name and that statues honoring his great-great-great-great uncle, Confederate General Robert E. Lee, ought to come down.  “It broke my heart to see a symbol of my family being used to allow such hate,” Lee told HuffPost. “All in the name of what my relative stood for.” “These statues have morphed into a symbol of racism, a symbol of bigotry, a symbol of the alt-right, a symbol of white nationalist movements,” he said. “That is not okay and that can never be celebrated or honored in any way, whether you believe you should honor legacy or ancestors or not.”",it,wrote,church
"A desperate search is underway for a 3-year-old Texas girl whose father says vanished after he left her outside at night as punishment for not drinking her milk, according to police. Sherin Mathews was last seen wearing a pink top and black pajama bottoms outside of her home in Richardson, just north of Dallas, around 3 a.m. Saturday, local authorities said in a release. She has “developmental issues and limited verbal communication skills,” according to the authorities.  Sherin’s father, Westley Mathews, allegedly told police that he ordered the three-feet-tall, 22-pound child to stand by a tree near an alley as punishment over the milk dispute. He returned to check on her 15 minutes later but found her gone. He didn’t call police until five hours later, Sgt. Kevin Perlich told Dallas-Fort Worth station KXAS-TV. “Why was the last sighting at 3 o’clock and the parents not call us until after 8 a.m.? That’s the question we want answered as well,” Perlich told the station. “As far as why she was out there, how long she was out there, that’s the questions we have for the parents.” Mathews was arrested later that night for abandoning or endangering a child, police said. He was released on $250,000 bond. According to a copy of the arrest affidavit obtained by local television station WFAA, the girl’s father told police that he knew coyotes had been spotted in the alley where he left his daughter. The home is also near railroad tracks. Amid the ongoing search for the child, a 4-year-old has been taken from the family’s home and placed in foster care, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services told WFAA. She added that the family has previously had contact with the department. Late Monday afternoon, an Amber Alert was discontinued due to a lack of leads in the case. Anyone with information on the child’s whereabouts is urged to contact police at 972-744-4800.",Alert,discontinued,case
"By Kaveh Waddell On a quiet afternoon, two medium-sized nuclear blasts level portions of Manhattan. If this were a movie, hordes of panicked New Yorkers would pour out into the streets, running around and calling out for their loved ones. But reality doesn’t usually line up with Hollywood’s vision of a disaster scene, says William Kennedy, a professor in the Center for Social Complexity at George Mason University. Instead, he expects people would stay in place, follow instructions, and tend to the injured nearby. To come up with a picture of what would really happen, Kennedy and Andrew Crooks, another researcher at the center, are working with a pair of Ph.D. candidates to study the immediate social aftermath of a nuclear blast in an American megacity. RELATED: Think Twice About Escaping Earth to an Exoplanet The Center for Social Complexity was awarded a grant worth more than $450,000 last May to develop a computer model that simulates how as many as 20 million individuals would react in the first 30 days after a nuclear attack in New York City. The grant, which came from the nuclear-focused Defense Threat Reduction Agency, or DTRA, will fund a three-year project. In the simulation, individual “agents” will make decisions and move about the area based on their needs, their surroundings, and their social networks. I spoke with Kennedy about his progress, and the challenges of simulating the aftermath of a disaster in one of the world’s biggest cities. A transcript of our conversation, lightly edited for concision and clarity, follows. Waddell: How will your computer model be able to accurately simulate people’s responses? Kennedy: First, we’re doing basic research to try and identify how we expect people to respond, and how the environment and infrastructure and facilities would respond. When we get verbal descriptions that we are comfortable with, we will represent them more precisely as computer programs. We’ll start with the environment, the weapon and its effects, and then move on to the people, the infrastructure, and their response. We’ve done other models of similar-sized areas, modeling natural disasters and things like that. So we have some infrastructure to support us. We’re using the MASON framework: It’s open source — our computer-science department distributes it and maintains it — and we’ve used it in several projects here. We’ll be bringing in graphical information on New York City and surrounding area, and we’ll model a small nuclear weapon — or possibly multiple small nuclear weapons — going off. They’ll be in the neighborhood of 5 to 10 kilotons: That’s half of Nagasaki/Hiroshima, which was in the 20 kiloton range. The Oklahoma City bomber used 5,000 pounds of TNT, so that’s two and a half tons. That destroyed most of the one building where it blew up, but it affected something like 16 city blocks. Waddell: So we’re talking damage to something like a chunk of Manhattan? Kennedy: Yes, something like that. The number 10 isn’t driven by any particular intelligence, but to put it into perspective, North Korea has done tests in the neighborhood of two kilotons — or maybe as many as five. So we’re talking a relatively small, though still nuclear, weapon. Waddell: What are the social responses you’ll look at? Kennedy: We’re planning to model at the individual level. A megacity is more than 10 million, and in the region we’re talking about, we’ll potentially get to 20 million agents. We’ve found that people seem to be reasonably well behaved and do what they’ve been trained to, or are asked or told to do by local authorities. Reports from 9/11 show that people walked down many tens of flights of stairs, relatively quietly, sometimes carrying each other, to escape buildings. We’re finding those kinds of reports from other disasters as well — except after Hurricane Katrina. There, we have reports that people already didn’t trust the government, and then with the isolation resulting from the flooding, they were actually shooting at people trying to help. Waddell: So is the difference between the two disasters trust and communication? Kennedy: I suspect that’s a large part of it, yes. Waddell: Do you mainly build the verbal models using interviews and reports? Kennedy: We’re reading studies about disasters, and we’re looking back to events like the Halifax munitions explosion of 100 years ago — that was in the kiloton range, and followed immediately by a blizzard — and natural disasters like earthquakes, flooding, and hurricanes. We’re going to have millions of agents, each with characteristics like where the agent lives, where it works, if it’s part of family, where the other members of the family are. That’s the first network that people respond to. But they’re also closely linked to the people they’re working with, or the people who are a part of their new family when they become isolated: the other people going down the stairs at the same time. That community now has a common experience. RELATED: How to Learn New Things as an Adult So we’re going to model individuals responding to the immediate situation around them. They’re trying to leave the area, find food, water, and shelter: basic Maslow-like necessities. DTRA wanted us to look at the reaction, not the recovery. They want to limit it to the first 30 days. Emergency responders will try to respond within minutes, so there will be some response. But no recovery, in the sense that infrastructure and business will start reestablishing normal behaviors. Waddell: So the players will include individuals and rescue agents — who else is involved in the model? Kennedy: When you broaden it more than just the collection of city blocks that are affected, you get into other infrastructure like police departments — not just fire and rescue that respond immediately, but others in the area, local governments, school systems, the utilities that provide food, water, clothing, shelter, etc. It’s a significant undertaking. Where we are is that we have done the basic literature research on how people respond to this kind of a disaster, and we are starting now to collect the geographic information system data — GIS data — on the New York area: the road systems, subway, bus routes, bridges, and things like that. It’s frustrating us a little bit that the publicly available data is not very clean. We’ve found lots of road segments that aren’t connected. We can’t just import somebody else’s map of New York and the surrounding areas and have our agents fleeing the area, so we’re spending some effort in the last several weeks trying to collect and clean up that data so that we can actually use it. Waddell: What are the goals that each individual agent will be balancing? Safety, hunger, family and friends, getting out of the area — how will the model treat those needs? Kennedy: One of the aspects we’ll be modeling is the individual agents’ social networks. Communications with those people, and confirmation of their status, seems to be one of the first urgencies that people feel, after their immediate survival of the event. Part of our modeling challenge is going to be figuring out if a parent would go through a contaminated area to retrieve a child at a daycare or school, putting themselves at risk in the process, because it’s important to them to physically be there with their children. Or do they realize that they’re isolated, that communications aren’t going to be available in the near term, and they only deal with their local folks who are now their family? That’s the sense we get. For a small nuclear weapon, especially a ground burst rather than an air burst, communications will not be as affected as they might be with an airborne electromagnetic pulse weapon. So communications may be available in the not-terribly-distant future from the initial event. Waddell: So your hypothesis is that a parent will tend to the people immediately around them, in hopes that better communication will allow them to get in touch with family later? Kennedy: Yes. And that changes what we expect our model will show from the Hollywood version of a disaster — people running down the streets. For disasters where people are injured, like a nuclear blast, as opposed to threatened with injury, we expect that everybody won’t exit the area en masse, because there will be people who need immediate help. Waddell: And all of this intelligence is coming from research and reports from previous disasters? Kennedy: Yes. Computational social science is not experimental. We don’t terrorize people and see how they behave. Waddell: How do you take these insights from research and build them into a model, so that your agents mimic reality? Kennedy: Through code that implements decisions trees, or needs that need to be fulfilled, for the individual agents in the models themselves. To give you an example from a previous model: We modeled herders and farmers in East Africa for the Office of Naval Research. We developed models of household units that had to make a living. They would make the living based on the terrain fertility, the water availability, and the weather in the local area. So we had a basic household unit that had these capabilities and then its behavior was, in a sense, driven by the environment that it’s in. Here, the environment is a lot more hostile, and we’re going all the way down to the individual level rather than the household level. Waddell: Can you also model psychological effects, like terror? Kennedy: That certainly does affect how people behave. Some people will be frozen and unable to function as a result of terror, as well as their injuries and the environment around them. We will be modeling those effects. But we’re not, per se, modeling the internal states of those individuals. We’re primarily modeling their behavior. Waddell: But to some extent, don’t you need to understand essentially what a person is feeling to try and guess what they’re going to do? Kennedy: We will be modeling people very carefully. The challenge is how precisely we can do that. I sometimes work on modeling individuals using a cognitive model that deals with memory and perception and actions at the near-millisecond level. Here, we probably don’t need a research-level cognitive model of every individual at the millisecond level. We are anticipating modeling people in the five-minute increment for the first several hours, and then expanding those steps, so that we talk about their actions in 15-minute intervals. That’s driven partly by the number of people, and the duration of the study. Waddell: With so many agents and such a long period of time, how much computation power will this require? Kennedy: It’s a lot! We do have significant university resources: We have a couple of clusters of computer systems, which we will probably tax significantly. We’re going to start small and find out how much we need tax them. We may be enlarging those facilities to provide the computation that we need. But to provide some scale, we did modeling for the National Science Foundation on the effects of climate change in Canada and how people might migrate. We were modeling millions of people, moving over the course of 100 years. That would run slowly on a desktop, and to do experiments, we went to the cluster so that we could run different scenarios. We don’t need to go 100 years, but we do need to have more people. We expect it’ll be taxing but within our resources. Waddell: Do you have an estimate of how long a single simulation run might take? Kennedy: I expect a single run may take a couple of days—and that’s at full scale, with all the people. Waddell: Will you be able to make changes to the model while a simulation is running? Kennedy: Not in the sense that you could change agents’ behaviors. But you might realize that because of the setup that you have people are not behaving as you expect. So the modeling of your behavior doesn’t make sense, and you have to go back and reconsider the model. Waddell: It sounds like common sense plays a big role. If you see people acting irrationally, would you stop the scenario to try and figure out what’s going and fix it? Kennedy: It depends on what you mean by irrational. Sometimes, it might be appropriate to have irrational behavior. RELATED: This Article Won’t Change Your Mind What you’re describing about common sense is referred to as “face validity.” If you have a simulation that comes up with something that’s just incredible on its viewing, it’s very hard to convince anybody that that’s reality. Waddell: And how do you separate the actually inaccurate from the surprising but true? Kennedy: There’s a couple of methods. One is that you try to be very careful about the reality of the model as you’re building it. This is sometimes called unit testing: You want small pieces to behave appropriately so that when you assemble them, the overall behavior is credible. You can also, where available, run scenarios that are intended to replicate historical events so that you can compare how your model behaves with the actual, in a sense, natural experiment. I expect we’ll be able to do that. We have a surprising amount of data on how people responded in Nagasaki and Hiroshima. The U.S. occupied Japan immediately afterwards, and photographed, interviewed, and tracked people over a period of time. A lot of that data is available. Waddell: What will your final product look like? Kennedy: It’s interesting how DTRA describes what they want as a result: They told us that they are funding basic research. They’re expecting published papers and academic advancement of students. We are not expected to deliver them a model, or a system they can go play with. Waddell: What’s the timeline going to look like? Kennedy: The funding is for three years, with a possibility of two additional years. We hope to have something running in the three- to six-month time frame that we can use for codifying our practical theories about how people behave. Our basic plan is to have something running and then try to set up experiments, run those, and do the validation and verification, so that we are comfortable starting to report results in a year or so. Waddell: How much of the work will be handled by the existing MASON system, and how much will need to be built from scratch? Kennedy: I would expect that most of what we’re dealing with in this project is doable within the current MASON. It will support very large numbers of agents over very large areas, and their interactions, reasonably responsively. The code is very fast—it is an industrial simulation system. We are exploring whether we should model individuals taking up a square meter of space when they move; we are wrestling with whether we need to model doors for each building or let people leave from anywhere around the block. One of the interesting challenges we’re facing is that we don’t have a lot of data about the height and number of floors of buildings. We have population density, and from that we can extrapolate how many floors are in the buildings and how many people are on each floor, so that we can deal with evacuations. Waddell: How does this simulation compare with others you’ve done on scale? Kennedy: There’s some work at the center that involves modeling the U.S. economy at full scale, which is over 100 million agents. But those are what you might call lighter agents: They are simpler so that we can model them at that scale. They’re individual people, but all they do is their business. They don’t do anything else. This is on the larger side of heavy-agent modeling, on the 20 million agent scale. We’ve been in the 5 to 10 million agent scale before. We can make things easier by modeling different parts of the system separately. When we modeled climate change, for example, the climatologists did their simulation of the environment and provided us with that data, so we didn’t have to spend computer time on those calculations. We could process that sequentially, day after day, for several years. So it’s breaking down the simulation into its parts, which allows us to pre-process them so that they’re easier to deal with in the overall social simulation.

"Warning: Major spoilers ahead. Major! You’ve been warned. Ten years and 19 movies into the ever-ballooning Marvel Cinematic Universe, the fabled Avengers have left their respective dwellings and greeted the interplanetary crusaders whose storylines haven’t yet interacted with their own. “There’s an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man?” Mark Ruffalo’s Bruce Banner, aka the Hulk, asks incredulously in one of the more relatable moments from “Avengers: Infinity War,” which opens this weekend to an expected $225 million intake. At last, all our friends ― the ones whose disparate adventures have yielded “Iron Man,” “Thor,” “Guardians of the Galaxy,” “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” “Black Panther” and other assorted tentpoles ― are acquainted. How special. Naturally, there’s no better time to kill most of them off. Except that’s only sort of what happens at the end of “Infinity War.” After more than two hours of wham-bam chaos, the movie slows to an emotional lull. The culminating battle royal results in the deaths of Black Panther, Spider-Man, Bucky Barnes, the Scarlet Witch, Doctor Strange, Star-Lord, Groot, Drax, Falcon, Mantis, Nick Fury and Maria Hill, each of whom dissolves into a pile of dust at the hands of a purple colossus named Thanos. The how and why hardly matter. What matters is that the final 20 minutes are meant to be a gut punch, testing the tear ducts of Marvel disciples who’ve waited so long to see the OG Avengers collaborate with the franchise’s rookies. Their wishes are granted and denied in the same fatal breath.  What matters even more, though, is that none of this really matters at all. You see, Marvel Studios is a business first (owned by Disney) and a story factory second. And because it’s a business, we know how many movies certain actors are contracted for and which ones have sequels already in development. That includes some whose characters supposedly went bye-bye. Take T’Challa, for example. His is easily the most shocking of the “Infinity War” deaths, given the ongoing cultural fervor surrounding “Black Panther,” the best film Marvel has made. Seeing T’Challa’s brawny body disintegrate is, in no short order, heartbreaking. But wait. Isn’t the studio “actively” negotiating a deal for Ryan Coogler to return to direct “Black Panther 2”? (Yes.) And hasn’t Chadwick Boseman only completed three of the five movies in his Marvel contract? (Yep.) T’Challa, in other words, will rise again, one way or another.  And what about little Peter Parker, who joined the series in 2016 and graduated to leading lad in last year’s jocular “Spider-Man: Homecoming”? Acting-wise, Tom Holland lands the finest moment in “Infinity War,” pleading with his mentor, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), that he is not ready to die. But we needn’t think hard to connect the dots on this one: 21-year-old Holland will reportedly shoot the next “Spider-Man” movie this summer, even though his web-slinger just perished. For kicks, here’s one more. Sebastian Stan, who plays the well-coiffed Bucky Barnes, is reportedly contracted for nine Marvel joints. (Nine?! Who has the time?) So far, he’s appeared in six ― and that’s only if we include his uncredited cameos in “Ant-Man” and “Black Panther,” which probably don’t count toward Stan’s tally. After the movie that will join “Infinity War” in concluding the principal “Avengers” saga next year, Stan will have at least two to go. What can we conclude from this information? Bucky Barnes will be back, as will the Guardians of the Galaxy, who are slated to conclude their standalone story with a third installment due out in 2020, according to director James Gunn. (Chris Pratt, otherwise known as the “late” Star-Lord, has already discussed “Vol. 3.”) And so on and so forth. Most of the Avengers left standing at the end of “Infinity War” hail from the first phase of Marvel’s big-screen ambitions. Chris Evans’ and Mark Ruffalo’s contracts are nearing their end, and Robert Downey Jr. has long operated under a picture-by-picture arrangement that does not guarantee his presence in any future entities. Those guys can cede custody of the series to the presumably resurrected generation of superheroes in the aforementioned “Avengers” conclusion, whose title has not been revealed because it would constitute a spoiler that probably concerns these deaths.  Or something! Again, I’m less concerned with how the Great Rebirth will happen than I am with the idea that we have ample cause to assume it will happen. Which brings us back to my original point: Fundamentally, the Marvel machine is not about storytelling. It’s about commerce. These films cost a fortune ― with a reported $300 million to $400 million budget, “Infinity War” may be the most expensive movie ever made ― and must be negotiated years in advance. That only leaves so much room for narrative mystery. When we know which characters are slated for which future installments, death is relatively futile. In keeping, the entire third act of this movie is a manipulative ploy. All those tears shed in multiplexes this weekend? The only real point they served was to ensure you’d hand over another $12 next year to see what comes of your favorite swashbucklers.  But we already know, more or less. There are no stakes. Even the baton-passing sometimes seen in the corresponding comic books ― a nurse named Jane Foster becoming the new Thor, for example ― can’t override the business transactions made public in this otherwise tight-lipped franchise. Sure, perhaps Shuri, T’Challa’s whiz-kid sister, can don the Black Panther suit next. But then how will Boseman fulfill his contract? (Here, fanboy theories are beside the point.) No matter what happens in the comics ― crisscrossing timelines, cape-swapping plot devices, whatever ― Marvel’s movies must function as, well, movies. “Avengers: Infinity War,” and anything else that grosses close to $1 billion, is pitched at anyone and everyone who is or isn’t familiar with its literary origins. But as the franchise progresses, the chronology of its events departs further and further from the order in which movies are released. That alone is inane. Historically, sequels, prequels and spinoffs clearly demarcate where an individual installment exists on a series’ grander timeline ― but Marvel makes little effort to do so. Audiences shouldn’t need a guidebook to figure out which plot technically occurred first, and they shouldn’t have to suspend their disbelief by pretending characters committed to future installments are dead. I don’t want to hear anything about how “Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3” could maybe, possibly, actually occur before “Infinity War,” despite hitting theaters two years later. For comparison’s sake, when the “Star Wars” galaxy hopscotches between time periods, each movie’s title clearly contextualizes its placement in the series. Trilogies are numbered by episodes, and one-offs are given the subtitle “A Star Wars Story.” There is no confusion as to how the plots ― or individual characters’ involvement ― fit together, even when the movies are released in a non-chronological fashion. So, from one overlapping Marvel pageant to the next, we should be able to assume that the ensuing movies’ events have a logical through-line. That is, after all, how sequels work, dammit. Just because Marvel is a so-called “cinematic universe” doesn’t make it any different. To kill off so many vital players in “Infinity War” is a cheap reflection of Hollywood’s bloated franchise infatuation. Disney knows you’ll be back for more next year. Hell, you might even be back for more next weekend. And as someone who just wants to see clever (and sensical) storytelling, I’m tired.  Someone save us from this capitalistic catastrophe. Someone who isn’t a superhero. ",he,lands,mentor
"There’s no denying it: Snapchat filters are a damn good time. So it’s no wonder Facebook has decided to adapt the concept for themselves ― though specifically for Halloween. On Thursday, Facebook announced that it’s rolling out Halloween-themed selfie filters for live video. Facebook is calling the filters “Live Masks.” You can only use them during a live video broadcast. To use them, simply launch the broadcast, tap the magic wand in the upper left corner and select the masks icon. Then you can swipe through the various spooky options and try them on your face! The Live Masks feature is available on Facebook’s iPhone app in the U.S., United Kingdom, and New Zealand and will eventually be on Android as well. As of now, you can turn your money-maker into a “limited-edition” skull, panda, unicorn or even a pumpkin. What’s more is that, unlike Snapchat, you don’t even have to hold on to your face to activate the filter! In addition to the masks, the social network has also rolled out Halloween reactions. Instead of merely “hearting” or “thumbs-upping” a post, you can send a “cackling witch to express laughter”  or “a grimacing jack o’lantern to show anger.” (Imagine the cackling witch became a permanent reaction? We’d send that witch to everrrryone.)  There’s also a skeletal thumbs up (”like”), a candy heart (”love”), a ghost (”wow”), and a Frankenstein (”sad”).

"When American Conservatory Theater first announced plans to renovate the Strand Theatre on Market Street, its Artistic Director, Carey Perloff, was bubbling over with ideas about what a second performance space could do for the company. With an eye to having more opportunities to commission new works, Perloff hoped that the Strand's location (smack in the middle of the mid-Market Street renewal effort) would be able to attract a new audience of techies who might be interested in seeing what a new generation of playwrights was producing. Community outreach was also mentioned as a key ingredient in the Strand's formula for success. Perloff hoped this would include local high school students writing about their experiences as well as ACT attempting to encourage and help develop writers from some of the Bay area's minority and ethnic communities. Over the years, whenever I brought a younger friend to the War Memorial Opera House for the first time in his life, he would comment that ""This audience is so old and white it's frightening!"" A sad, but true observation for, despite all the propaganda used to sell the arts to the masses, opera has largely remained a conservative white man's art form. As a rule, productions of Turandot and Madama Butterfly don't flood an opera house with Puccini-crazed Asian Americans. During the 1980s, Michigan Opera Theatre attempted to make inroads among Detroit's ethnic groups by staging a series of minority-oriented operas -- Armen Tigranian's 1912 opera, Anoush; Stanislaw Moniuszko's  1865 opera, Straszny Dwor (The Haunted Manor); and Scott Joplin's second opera, Treemonisha (which was composed in 1910 but did not receive its official premiere in 1972) -- with help from the local Armenian, Polish, and African American communities. Although one wonders whether audiences who bought tickets for these events were sufficiently motivated to attend subsequent performances of the standard repertoire which lacked a similar ethnic appeal (most of M.O.T.'s ticket buyers were prodded into action by a sense of ethnic pride or some less-than-subtle pressure from their church congregations), at least they were introduced to a musical art form that was accessible on some cultural level. More recently, several Bay area theatre companies have eagerly presented new works by Asian-American, African-American, and Latino-American playwrights to glowing acclaim. Unfortunately, arts marketers who embraced the ""reefer madness"" philosophy of subscription sales often deluded themselves with the assumption that one experience would have the same dizzying, and life-long effect on a new attendee as a toke of marijuana does on an innocent teenager. As a result, I'm curious to see how well ACT's double bill (Monstress) based on two short stories by Lysley Tenorio will succeed in building any kind of lasting outreach to the local Filipino American community. Will Pinoys come back for more theatre? Or will this be a one-off kind of event. The two short stories which were chosen attracted two of the Bay area's more prolific talents: Philip Kan Gotanda and Sean San José. As actor/director/playwright San José sees things, the evening's common theme of ""a love not meant to be"" makes quite a bit of sense to him.  For Sean, Lysley's collection of short stories about the life of Filipino immigrants raises some important questions: What quickly becomes obvious is that these two plays are (a) labors of love, and (b) could each sustain about 15-20 minutes of cuts. Working on a handsome unit set designed by Nina Ball with costumes by Lydia Tanji and sound design by Jake Rodriguez, the two plays (which harken back to earlier moments in the 20th century) are wildly different, yet touchingly sentimental * * * * * * * * * * The evening begins with Philip Kan Gotanda's new play, Remember the I-Hotel, whose opening scene takes place in San Francisco's Manilatown on August 4, 1977. To the sound of angry protesters who are trying to save the International Hotel and police who are trying to get rid of the protesters, the audience witnesses two old Filipino men struggling to get themselves together so that they can leave the hotel. Suddenly, there is a flashback to earlier times, as a beautiful Filipino dance hall singer (Melody Butiu) lends crucial ambiance to the segments set in the 1930s.

After a night of drinking, they return to Vicente's room at the International Hotel where, in a rare moment of intimacy, Nado kisses Vicente goodnight. Although Vicente may think nothing of returning Nado's kiss (and can't even remember it the following morning), that kiss means the world to Nado, a closeted gay man who is just starting to experience life in the big city. As Gotanda notes: ""I grew up in Stockton in the '50s and '60s with many Filipino Americans as neighbors. The older Filipino American men, the manongs, held a kind of special place in my imagination because they'd always be walking around with those stinky cigars they smoked and they all looked really cool. They were always so well dressed. All of that provided a world I wanted to go back and explore.""  Ogie Zulueta is Vicente in Remember The I-Hotel

But Vicente has grown accustomed to having sex with Althea in one of the hotel's suites (as a maid, she has the keys to every room). Disappointed and disgusted, Nado goes for a walk on the Embarcadero. Impulsively, he calls the hotel to report that a mixed-race couple is using one of the suites for sex. Later, while Nado hooks up with an anonymous man, Vicente is viciously beaten by the hotel's security guard as Althea stands helplessly by.  Vicente (Ogie Zulueta) and Althea (Kelsey Venter) share

Remember The I-Hotel (Photo by: Kevin Berne) In discussing his take on Nado, Tenorio explains that: ""He really was just a character who came to me. But when I hit the final drafts, that's when I started bringing in some of those questions from the real world. Certainly, I've thought about 'Is this character going to be demonized because he is a gay character who is, in essence, committing an act of betrayal?' But it felt true to the story. While I could understand those concerns, maybe that's the luxury of writing now as opposed to writing this 20 years ago. Today there is more appreciation of gay life, gay culture, gay and characters. I don't want to say that I have a little more 'freedom,' but I can (a little more willfully) have Nado be the agent of betrayal in that story without worrying about 'Oh great, the one gay character is also the guy who screws the other guy over in the end.' The question becomes: Is this true to Nado's character? Is this true to the story? And I think it is. I don't think he sees it as an act of betrayal in the moment, but he certainly realizes it as an old man."" As the play ends, the two men are being evicted from the International Hotel. Although by now, he can barely communicate, Vicente (who insisted on 'leading' back in the 1930s when he was trying to teach Nado how to dance) quietly gestures to Nado, indicating that he's ready to follow. Remember the I-Hotel, which has been poignantly directed by Carey Perloff, gives ACT's audience a chance to appreciate the craft of two of the Bay area's finest character actors: Ogie Zulueta and Jomar Tagatac. Robert Hand's lighting design adds a special sense of period to the play. * * * * * * * * * * Sean San José's adaptation of Monstress is a much more rambunctious affair in which he plays a Filipino filmmaker named Checkers Rosario (who has been pumping out Grade-B horror features like The Squid Children of Cebu, Bat-Winged Pygmy Queen, Werewolf Girl, and Coconut-Headed Bride of Coconut-Headed Dracula for Manila's CocoLoco Pictures).

in a scene from Monstress (Photo by: Kevin Berne) The action begins in the 1970s, just before Checkers gets dropped by an executive at CocoLoco Pictures. His girlfriend, Reva Gogo (Melody Butiu), who has also been his leading lady, is more than willing to stop making pictures so that she and Checkers can settle down and raise a family. Checkers, however, is no quitter. When an American producer named Gaz Gazman (Nick Gabriel) tracks him down and expresses interest in using some of the footage Checkers has shot in Manila for his American pictures, Checkers is easily swayed by the possibilities. He's also impressed that Gaz identifies his mixture of low-budget Filipino and American horror films as a new genre entitled ""Chop-Suey Cinema."" It doesn't take much prodding for the Filipino filmmaker to accept Gazman's offer of a trip to California for himself and his girlfriend. Gaz soon explains that they will actually be landing in San Jose (which is nowhere near Hollywood). Why? Because Gaz lives in San Mateo and films his movies on the styrofoam sets he has built in the basement of his mother's house in Colma.  In a scene from Monstress, Gaz Gazman (Nick Gabriel)

However, the real strength of Monstress lies in the creation of a Greek-style Pinoy chorus consisting of two very swishy Filipino cinephiles -- Mata (Jomar Tagatac) and Dala (Olgie Zulueta) -- and their movie-loving fag hag, Tala (Rinabeth Apostol). It's a brilliant twist on an ancient narrative device that works beautifully under the circumstances.  Ogie Zulueta (Dala), Jomar Tagatac (Mata), and Rinabeth Apostol (Tala)

"On April 28, 2008, Sarah Schacht received an email that terrified her. The Sunlight Foundation, a government transparency group, had invited Schacht, the head of a budding good-government nonprofit, to join a conference call. There on the invitation list was Clay Johnson — a man she says once tried to rape her. Reeling, Schacht called a friend at Sunlight, who told her the foundation had just hired Johnson. Within an hour, she said, she was on the phone with Sunlight’s executive director, Ellen Miller. Schacht said Miller received her story with a stern voice and a battery of excuses: “Well, I’m sure there was some confusion, it was so long ago, he was so young at the time, and now he’s in this great relationship,” Schacht recalls Miller saying. In her disbelief, Schacht blurted out that she wasn’t Johnson’s only victim, but that didn’t seem to faze Miller either. “I left the phone call shaking,” Schacht said. Although Miller insists no such call ever happened, the conversation Schacht remembers must have been repeated many times. For more than a decade, women have accused Johnson, a leader in the world of political technology, of physical and verbal abuse. They’ve complained to some of the most powerful people in Washington’s nonprofit and progressive circles — only to watch, horrified, as Johnson became a powerful figure, too. During Johnson’s first job in politics, on Howard Dean’s 2004 presidential campaign, Schacht and a fellow campaign worker separately accused Johnson of sexual assault. Word of both women’s complaints reached several of Dean’s top deputies. But Johnson kept his job, and his work on the campaign became his ticket to a high-profile career. He went on to co-found a pathbreaking political consulting firm. Powerful groups and people sought his thoughts on the future of tech in politics; his Twitter banner shows him cracking a joke to a roomful of government officials including President Barack Obama. Despite Schacht’s warning about his behavior, the Sunlight Foundation chose him to head its flagship technology division. He left amid a staff insurrection over his lewd and menacing behavior. And still, he rose higher. His reputation seemed to be an open secret. “People would go, ‘Oh yeah, that’s Clay,’” said Erie Meyer, a tech worker who said Johnson harassed her at a 2013 conference. “And I’m thinking, ‘How have you all been letting him wander the halls of progressive power and know he’s like this?’” HuffPost spoke with more than two dozen of Johnson’s former supervisors, peers and colleagues, many of whom talked on the record, in search of an explanation. The answer implicates not only Johnson as a serial abuser but a constellation of progressive and good-government groups that failed to put their values into action. On the eve of the most consequential midterm election in a decade, it also raises grave questions about how prepared politicians are to protect the people who get them elected. Nearly 20,000 people will work in the local and national campaigns this year, and as many as 5 percent of all registered voters will volunteer. Should they face harassment or abuse, few of them will have any recourse. “We just pass creeps from campaign to campaign,” said Meg Reilly, vice president of the Campaign Workers Guild, a new union seeking to organize political workers across the country. “The excuse becomes, ‘We’ll deal with this once the candidate gets elected.’ People tell themselves that if they’re working for this candidate who’s really fantastic, who opposes sexism and racism, then everyone on the campaign is immune from committing the same sins.” Once the election ends, little prevents abusive employees from starting a second act in government, political advocacy or nonprofits.  Johnson, in interviews with HuffPost, described his history in the workplace as “awful” and said it filled him with shame, hurt and regret, although he disputed the details of most of his accusers’ stories.  “I don’t know the answer to that,” he said when asked if he had sexually assaulted two women on the Dean campaign. “What I can tell you is, I had two women complain to management on the Dean campaign about sexual harassment, and I was given a warning.” Later, he said his memory of his encounter with Schacht didn’t include anything he would describe as “assault.” “My entire career was littered with treating people very poorly,” he continued. “Whether that was the Sunlight Foundation, the Dean campaign, or anywhere else I worked. I did not behave appropriately. I was awful to people, to nearly every single person, and I really wish I hadn’t been.” In the summer of 2003, the Howard Dean campaign felt electric with promise. Although the former Vermont governor’s presidential bid would later be remembered for the Dean Scream, at the time people noticed the groundbreaking way his supporters met and organized online. Schacht, who was raring to work in political tech, joined the campaign as an intern in New Hampshire. “I thought, wow, I really want to work with those guys, on that team,” she said. “I wanted that experience to be the start of my career.” Specifically, Schacht wanted to work with Clay Johnson, who had joined the Dean campaign earlier that year, first as a volunteer and then full-time in the Burlington, Vermont, headquarters as its lead programmer. Johnson, who is more than 6 feet tall, had a domineering personality and usually spoke without a filter. But he struck Schacht as smart and ambitious. When he said he could look for an opening for her on his team, Schacht recalled, she moved to Vermont. She spent 10- and 12-hour days doing odd jobs as a volunteer for the finance and youth outreach teams. At night, she crashed in one of the Dean campaign’s ubiquitous group houses. One night in late fall, she was staying at an apartment that Johnson rented. She was sleeping on an air mattress in the living room when he woke her up by stumbling against the walls, she said. Schacht recalled worrying that he was sick or so drunk he might hurt himself, and she got up to ask him if he was all right. “He kissed me, and I was surprised. But before I could say anything, the next thing I remember is I was pinned on his bed,” she said. He was trying to have sex with her. “I’m saying ‘No!’ I’m saying ‘Stop.’ I’m saying, ‘Don’t do this, stop.’” Schacht said she brought her knees to her chest and with all four of her limbs tried to shove Johnson away. She doesn’t know how long she held him off, she said, but it felt like an excruciatingly long time. He didn’t let up until he passed out drunk, she said, and she pushed him off her.  The morning after Johnson’s alleged assault, Schacht said, she abandoned the air mattress and checked into a hotel. Johnson said his memory of that night is “radically different”.  “It’s not a recollection that would involve the word ‘assault,’” he said. “That said, it doesn’t really matter. What matters is that she has pain over this encounter, and I have caused her that pain.” I asked Johnson if he was saying sexual assault is a matter of interpretation. “I think that there is a clear line, but the line gets much less clear after 15 years of memories,” he replied. Later, in an email, Johnson claimed he and Schacht never discussed the idea of her joining his team but that they went on several dates “with what I believe to be romantic intent” before the night in question. “On our first date, she stopped me on the way into a restaurant and kissed me. I started to avoid Sarah after that.” Within weeks, Schacht told several of her colleagues about the incident, including a Dean campaign employee, Amanda Michel, who let Schacht share her rented bedroom once the hotel became too expensive. (Schacht slept in the walk-in closet.)  Michel confirmed to HuffPost that Schacht told her about Johnson’s alleged assault; in all, HuffPost spoke to six people who said Schacht told them Johnson had assaulted her. Michel also said that a second woman told her Johnson had sexually assaulted her and that Schacht and the other woman did not seem to be aware of one another at the time. (Michel was director of HuffPost’s OffTheBus project in 2007 and 2008. The second woman declined to speak for this article; HuffPost is withholding her name because it does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault without their consent.) Alarmed, Michel told her boss, Zephyr Teachout, who was the campaign’s director of online organizing and nominally Johnson’s supervisor on some projects, although Teachout didn’t believe she had the authority to fire him. Teachout doesn’t recall being aware of the second accuser. But she alerted at least two members of Dean’s inner circle — Bob Rogan, the deputy campaign manager, and Joe Trippi, who oversaw the entire operation — that Johnson faced a serious allegation of sexual assault. Two former Dean staffers who spoke on condition of anonymity said they got word of the second accusation to Rogan.  Teachout asked what the accuser should do. Trippi essentially waved her aside, Teachout said. “My impression was that he had no plans to do anything about it and no suggestions for what an accuser should do,” she said. Rogan, whom she met with separately, was more diplomatic but no less evasive. “I left feeling like nothing would be done,” Teachout recalled. “It was totally demoralizing and radicalizing and unacceptable. I had nothing to tell anyone about what they could do with accusations, no recourse, no process, no recognition. It haunted me.” Schacht was in a daze. “I just didn’t know what to make of what had happened to me,” she said. “I knew it was wrong. I knew I had fought him off. I just didn’t know where to go or what to say.” She realized her future could depend on being part of Dean’s team. She decided to stay with the campaign and take a new, paid position in Iowa. She was 24. That winter, Schacht said, she received calls from a lawyer for the Dean campaign and a female campaign official. They asked questions about her encounter with Johnson that made her deeply uncomfortable. “I ended up reporting that he had attempted to rape me.” Johnson couldn’t recall anyone asking him questions about his behavior. But there had been one repercussion, he said: Rogan, in the presence of his co-deputy campaign manager, Tom McMahon, gave Johnson a warning. “They were like, ‘This complaint has come in, so like, cool it,’” Johnson said. “I would say it made me more defensive. I’m not sure I would say it altered my behavior.” Rogan, who is now the chief of staff for Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), said he didn’t recall any discussions he may have had about Johnson. Neither did McMahon. Trippi, who has worked on dozens of Democratic campaigns since, didn’t recall a conversation with Teachout either. But he doubted it would have lasted very long. “It would have gotten like a nanosecond of me even recognizing what she was saying,” he said. “I dealt with the bigger strategy. If it was about money or people, it would have been, ‘Go talk to Bob.’” The Dean campaign was not unique in lacking a process for dealing with complaints of harassment and abuse. Unless the people in charge make a conscious decision to put rules in place, chaos is a campaign’s default setting. Political campaigns are short-lived organizations where every dollar and body is applied toward the singular goal of winning. The pay is low, the hours are grueling, and the whole operation collapses after Election Day. Typically the only people willing to work under these conditions are true believers — young ones whose expectations about work are still unformed. The Dean campaign, former staffers recall, combined all these factors. Dean’s was the Bernie Sanders or Barack Obama campaign of 2004 — the one attracting scores of 19- to 25-year-olds who had never worked in politics. A former official recalled pleading with staffers not to drink and drive through the streets of Burlington. “You’re wearing shorts and T-shirts,” said one Dean campaign worker. “Your furniture is whatever you pulled out of the garbage. You’re not doing it for the money, so you don’t see it as a job … although it is.” That campaign worker was one of the first people Schacht spoke to about Johnson’s alleged attack. In the chaos of the campaign, he was loosely considered Schacht’s supervisor. He asked for anonymity to be candid about how he responded to her report. “I regret to say that I didn’t know what to do when she told me,” he said. “Maybe because I’d never had a real job — I was always on campaigns — I really wasn’t sure what you do. … I almost felt like I was in college and somebody told me they’d had somebody cross the line. But looking back now, Jesus Christ, it’s pretty simple, you do A, B, C.” Dean, by all accounts, was never involved in any of the discussions about Johnson. “This is the first I’m hearing of it,” the former candidate said.  He said if a campaign receives a complaint, it ought to fire the accused campaign worker immediately. It’s possible the person being fired did nothing wrong, he continued, but it’s more important to keep the campaign running smoothly. “In politics, unfair things happen to people sometimes,” Dean said. “There’s a greater cause [at stake], and it’s the campaign.” But the same mentality makes it difficult for campaign workers to report abuse. “What if it goes public and takes down the campaign?” Michel said. “No one wants to be the story or be part of the story that takes down their candidate. Not when you’ve sacrificed so much.” Asked how future candidates could change that mentality, Dean had little to offer. He suggested that candidates make their values clear and post rules of conduct in the campaign office.  “Look, you just don’t have time to straighten these things out,” he said. “Campaigns are chaotic. … There’s not going to be a campaign where there’s going to be a process.” Johnson said something similar. “Campaigns are strange creatures,” he said when asked if he was surprised he wasn’t fired. “They don’t live very long. There’s not a lot of time for investigation and fact-finding.” Later, he emailed to say he’d reconsidered the question. “Yes,” he said, he was surprised. “If anybody that worked for me acted the way I did on that campaign on any given day, but especially given those allegations, I would fire them.” The Dean campaign collapsed in February 2004, but its reputation for revolutionizing politics online endured. Buoyed by this legacy, Johnson and three other Dean alums — Joe Rospars, Jascha Franklin-Hodge and Ben Self — founded a lucrative consulting firm, Blue State Digital. The firm easily attracted top-tier clients, such as the Democratic National Committee (where Dean was elected chair in 2005 and McMahon became his executive director) and a presidential hopeful, Sen. Barack Obama. But multiple former Dean staffers — men and women alike — said they passed up opportunities to work with Blue State Digital because of Johnson’s reputation. Their hesitancy seems warranted. Two of Blue State’s early employees said Johnson was an unmitigated bully. One of them recalled witnessing Johnson tell a pregnant Blue State employee, “You’re going to push that baby out under the conference table because that’s as much maternity leave as I’m going to give you.” “I don’t believe I said that,” Johnson said. “I did say, ‘I’m glad that we’re not eligible for FMLA.’ I made an obnoxious comment, but not that obnoxious comment.” (FMLA refers to the Family and Medical Leave Act, which requires employers of a certain size to provide eligible workers unpaid leave for the birth of a child.) Blue State said it wasn’t aware of Johnson’s “unacceptable” comment and that it has always offered paid parental leave, including to that employee. While Johnson launched into the next phase of his career, some of his former Dean colleagues continued to agonize over his abusiveness. “I felt like we had totally failed,” Teachout said. She felt hesitant to tell Johnson’s future employers about an accusation she had heard secondhand and thinks it’s even possible she provided a positive reference. Occasionally, she and Michel discussed how to stop serial abusers from moving from one campaign to another and wondered why the national party didn’t have a hotline or a system in place. (“Yeah, there could be a role for the party,” Dean said.) At the end of 2007, Blue State Digital forced Johnson out. “Clay was asked to leave the company because his partners didn’t want to work with him anymore, not because of any allegations of inappropriate behavior,” the firm said in a statement. “Clay would not be hired today, we’re glad we fired him over a decade ago and we regret he was ever associated with the company.” The firm wouldn’t provide further details.  By spring 2008, Johnson had been quietly hired by the Sunlight Foundation — at the time, the center of gravity for the open-government movement. Johnson started work at Sunlight that summer overseeing its digital technology lab. He gave the impression that he’d left Blue State a wealthy person, several former Sunlight employees said, and it was clear from the outset that he played a significant role in helping the nonprofit raise money and attract grants. Schacht had fallen into Sunlight’s orbit, too. In the years since she worked on the Dean campaign, she had founded a small but scrappy nonprofit, Knowledge As Power, that offered a free legislative tracker to local governments. “Thinking about her capabilities, and planfulness, and knowledge, I kind of view her as a visionary,” said Gary Pollack, who worked for KAP starting in 2010. “She has this vigor and this capacity to keep the forest and the trees in her sightline.” In January 2008, Sunlight extended KAP a small grant. More significantly, Ellen Miller, the foundation’s executive director, gave Schacht glowing introductions to numerous potential donors and collaborators.  But Schacht claims there was an abrupt change in the relationship after she told Miller that Johnson, Sunlight’s star new hire, had once attacked her. The flattering introductions stopped, and Schacht got the impression she no longer had Sunlight’s imprimatur. It started with the email inviting Schacht and Johnson to a conference call. The call was to discuss an upcoming Sunlight conference, and Schacht contacted a friend at Sunlight, John Wonderlich, to make sure she and Johnson wouldn’t share any panels. Schacht heard Wonderlich gasp. Sunlight had just hired Johnson, he said. Wonderlich, who is now Sunlight’s executive director, said he felt obligated to tell Miller, and he arranged for Miller and Schacht to speak. By then, Schacht had spoken directly to Johnson’s other accuser from the Dean campaign, and she told Miller both of their stories.  Miller seemed unmoved, Schacht said. Later that year, Schacht claims, Sunlight shut down KAP’s request for a larger grant, and it announced plans to launch a legislative tracker that Schacht felt was in direct competition with hers. Miller said there was no chilliness and no such phone call. Sunlight made hundreds of small grants to groups like KAP, she said, but rarely, if ever, gave out larger sustainable grants. It’s true that she stopped introducing Schacht to potential donors, but that’s because there were only so many donors to introduce. “It only happens once, at the beginning of the process, and that’s all there really is to the story,” Miller said. As for the phone call: “I simply do not recall either a phone call or an interest in having a conversation with her about Clay Johnson. I would have remembered a serious accusation like that one, I would remember that, and I would tell you I remember that.” In response to Miller’s denial of the call and Johnson’s claim that their relationship was ever romantic, Schacht said, “Their statements do not match my interactions with them.” Johnson said he wasn’t aware of any hasty phone call between Miller and Schacht. But he emailed Miller in June 2008 to warn her that he and Schacht had a history from the Dean campaign. “She hates me,” he wrote, in an email he shared with HuffPost. “Absolutely despises me. Happy to talk to you about it in person, but it’s mainly gossip, innuendo, stale and old. It is weird, I’m happy to talk about it with you. But the short story is: It was a presidential campaign, it was Vermont. She was like 22, I was 26 and we were both shamefully less professional in the workplace. You can put the rest of that story together. I promise there’s not a long slough of disgruntled female campaign staffers in my closets. But there is one, and it is her.” Johnson added that Schacht was very talented and smart and that Knowledge As Power was an impressive project. “That being said, she’s perhaps the one person I can think of in the world that has a real issue with me.”  Johnson claims he told Miller in person that Schacht had filed a sexual harassment complaint with the Dean campaign. Miller insists this isn’t true: “He didn’t say anything about a sexual harassment claim against him at the Dean campaign, I’m certain.” Many of Sunlight’s staff members would come to have issues with Johnson as well. Johnson routinely made obscene comments toward his co-workers, according to multiple former Sunlight employees. Nisha Thompson, one former employee, described him as “leery” and “a bully.” Once, she ran into him at a bar outside of work. As soon as she said hello, she claims, Johnson replied, “I’m going to fuck you in the ass.” He sought her out at work the next day to say he’d been blackout drunk, Thompson said.  Johnson’s most frequent target was a young digital designer who reported directly to him. Her desk was next to Johnson’s, and other members of the labs team said she was the butt of all his lewdest comments. In summer 2010, he said something so inappropriate that the team, in dramatic fashion, dragged her desk away from his and surrounded her with their own desks. No one could recall the exact comment. But both the designer and a former Sunlight employee, Hafeezah Abdullah, said the incident involved Johnson spraying the designer in the face with a can of compressed air used for dusting keyboards. The designer and at least one other team member told HuffPost they complained to the head of operations, who was Sunlight’s de facto HR rep. Johnson didn’t recall his barside run-in with Thompson. It was possible it happened while he was blacked out from drinking, he said; he’s now in recovery. He remembers spraying the designer in the face, but he doesn’t remember making a lewd remark. “I can see how my actions toward her made her uncomfortable,” Johnson said. “I looked at her like a kid sister. I made comments like, ‘Hey, those are great shoes,’ and I probably did so too frequently. … I’m really sorry that in our professional relationship, I did not treat her with the respect of her talent that she deserved.” Sunlight didn’t ask Johnson to leave over the spray-can incident, he said, but it gave him a warning. He quit the next day out of anger and defensiveness after seeing the rearranged desks. Sunlight, he said, “asked me to stay.” Former staffers said Sunlight never addressed the staff about his behavior or departure. The foundation, saying it could not discuss personnel matters, declined to respond to a list of detailed questions. Multiple former employees said Sunlight’s failure to address Johnson’s behavior emboldened other men whose conduct also crossed lines. “Because of Sunlight’s lack of response, things escalated,” an ex-employee said. Said another, “It became a totally permissive culture.” A few of the senior men on staff hit on new female hires as a matter of course, two former employees recalled, and made sexually inappropriate comments. On a work trip, one senior staffer told a young female employee he had a genital piercing. Sunlight struggled with these issues long after Johnson was gone. “An issue I was very disappointed to encounter at Sunlight was the lack of clarity around how to handle hostile work environment or sexual harassment issues,” an employee wrote in a 2015 exit memo obtained by HuffPost. “It became clear to me that, as colleagues came to me with examples of these issues they actively faced at Sunlight, they did not feel there was anyone in the organization they could turn to for addressing the issue.” After Sunlight, Johnson moved into a covetable role as a Presidential Innovation Fellow, part of a group of tech luminaries enticed by a signature Obama administration program to dedicate six months to improving government technology. He published his book, The Information Diet: A Case for Conscious Consumption, and became a fixture at conferences where lecturers spoke grandly about technology’s role in making government more transparent and accountable. All this time, “his party trick was bringing women down a notch,” said Erie Meyer, the tech worker. At Personal Democracy Forum in 2013, Johnson humiliated her by saying to a group of CEOs she was meeting for the first time, “This is Erie Meyer. She’s Gray Brooks’ fiancée and she has herpes.” She was neither engaged nor did she have a sexually transmitted infection, but “this was Clay’s way of letting people know that I was a plus-one — I was not a person of note.” Meyer sobbed in a stairwell and skipped the rest of the conference.  A year later, Johnson became a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. “We heard no reports of any kind of inappropriate behavior before, during or after Clay Johnson’s time at CAP and would have acted if the case was otherwise,” a spokesperson told HuffPost. The Presidential Innovation Fellows program didn’t respond to requests for comment. No one provided evidence that either CAP or the fellows program was warned about Johnson’s behavior — although plenty wondered how his reputation could have escaped them. Today, Johnson and his family live in his home state of Georgia. He worked as a senior vice president at the international volunteer organization Points of Light from 2016 to 2017 until, according to him, the commute into Atlanta became too long. He said he now mostly keeps to himself, writing Medium and Twitter posts for a sizable online following. He said he regrets his past behavior and left Washington to get off the destructive path he was on.  Asked if he was surprised to have had a successful career despite that behavior, he said, “Am I surprised or shocked at what I was able to accomplish and how I was able to do it? I don’t know, I don’t have an answer.” But he has been thinking about how politics could treat men differently. “There’s no one that ever said to me in Washington, ‘Hey, Clay, you have a problem and you need to get some help.’ That’s not to say I’m not responsible for my actions, but [a cultural change] there, especially amongst young men, to watch out for this kind of behavior and to have the courage to say something could really go a long way.”  “Young men in particular are able to, in politics, ascend very, very quickly and with almost no executive coaching,” he continued. “I had never been through any training in sexual harassment. I had no idea how to treat women in the workplace. Most of the people my age that found power and success in that community were also the same way, meaning no one had any form of mentorship.” I suggested that many of his former colleagues hadn’t required coaching to treat one another with decency. “I’m not trying to defend myself,” Johnson said. “There are people who figure out how to run marathons on their own and there are also people who need help.” “To the women that I know that have had issues with me, if they would have anything to do with me or want to be near me, I would extend an apology immediately, and I do not blame them for not” wanting to encounter him ever again, he said. “If these people are still feeling pain as a result of an encounter with me, or knowing me, or me being in their lives, even for a moment, that’s fucking awful, and there’s not an excuse for that. There’s not something I can do to make that go away.” Although Johnson avoided self-destruction, he left a trail of devastation behind him. Numerous people recalled avoiding work opportunities — especially at Blue State Digital — that would place them in Johnson’s path. Because Schacht remained in the same industry, she was forced to see him occasionally, but she steered clear of events and projects where she might encounter him one-on-one. A few years ago, the lack of funding for Knowledge As Power forced her to shut it down. Johnson’s other accuser from the Dean campaign left politics altogether. “The fact that I’ve seemed to encounter people across my career who think he’s problematic, the number of people who are concerned about him but are flies on the wall to his behavior, I find that so incredibly disturbing,” Schacht said. “To know that in the Dean campaign, to now know that there were two reports, and nothing was done? And that kicked off his career and led to all of these other things? It’s appalling.” “I hope other organizations and people who are putting together campaigns take a lesson from what happened here,” she continued. “I’m a powerful person. I get shit done. For me, who was physically powerful enough to physically hold a massive man off of me, and overcome my fear, and find any opportunity to keep doing my work, but still have to dodge and weave this guy — that’s too much to ask of even the strongest of us.” A change could take a while. After the incident at Personal Democracy Forum, Meyer emailed the most prominent CEO who had been present for Johnson’s herpes remark. “Why didn’t you say anything or stand up for me?” she asked. “What went through your mind?” At first, the executive, whose identity Meyer promised to keep secret, was dismissive. “Because in the 5 minutes prior he repeatedly called me a child molester,” he replied. “Like 5 times.” When she pressed him, he replied, “I took what he said to you to mean you were part of the circle, you were cool and I should pay attention to you. I actually thought *more* of you not less,” he wrote. But he added, “I understand why you were offended.” That was several days following the conference. In the moments after Johnson spoke, nobody had said a word. The story has been updated with comment from the Center for American Progress.

Or prefer regular updates from websites that feed you news that is: When Nixon In China received its world premiere from the Houston Grand Opera on October 22, 1987, audiences were stunned by the portrayal of Tricky Dick as a wistful world traveler obsessed with the idea of making news. Nixon's 1972 mission to establish ties with Communist China was an important peace effort. However, it might surprise people to learn that (according to blogger Danios) America Has Been At War 93% of the Time -- 222 Out of 239 Years -- Since 1776. To put this in perspective: Pick any year since 1776 and there is about a 91% chance that America was involved in some war during that calendar year.								 Pope Francis recently made headlines with his controversial statements about war. Some of the points he made were: This year marks the 100th anniversary of America's entry into World War I. For librarians, World War I also gave birth to the Library War Service (as Linton Weeks explains in his excellent article entitled When America's Librarians Went To War).

Numerous books have been written about the tragedy, accompanied by several made-for-television movies and documentaries. As part of the illustrations he created for Lost Liners: From the Titanic to the Andrea Doria -- The Ocean Floor Reveals Its Greatest Ships, the great maritime artist, Ken Marschall, provided the following renderings of the Lusitania's last voyage. Note that the Cunard Line's traditional red-and-black funnels had been painted black because of the war threat.

As a life-long fan of ocean liners and classic steamships (with one bedroom decorated entirely in images of ships from the past), I can't begin to describe what it was like to see the following image of the Lusitania blown up to the size of the giant screen in the Castro Theatre.  The Cunard Line's RMS Lusitania at sea  A little bit of late-night research on YouTube led me to the following two clips: * * * * * * * * * * With live musical accompaniment by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, this year's San Francisco Silent Festival devoted its opening night program to a screening of Lewis Milestone's 1930 war epic, All Quiet on the Western Front. Because it was released as silent film was transitioning to talkies, this movie became notable for several curious distinctions:   As David Thomson explains in his program note: All Quiet on the Western Front was shot with two cameras, one for a sound film, and the other for a film that has music and sound effects, but no dialogue. That is the version the Silent Film Festival is showing -- played instead with live music. Isn't this a film about quiet?  There are other benefits. The silent version is a little longer. It has intertitles, like most silent films. But because the characters are without voices, it is easier to feel they are German, or supposed outcasts to our sympathy. Synchronized dialogue was a concession to naturalism. That thinking can work both ways. Step back from All Quiet being made on the cusp of the shift in technology and narrative approach. After all, a silent film festival need not stay in the past.  There has been great reward and pleasure in rediscovering and restoring silent films, and that will go on some time yet before there are few gems left to be rescued. Moreover, the silent film is not just a measure of history or nostalgia. It is an authentic form, as natural and moving as black-and-white films.  You may decide that the silent All Quiet is superior to the sound version, which actually ruled at the box office. [But] you must also remember that, in rural areas, the conversion of theaters for sound was gradual and sometimes reluctant (especially as it coincided with the years of crash and depression).  Poster art for 1930's All Quiet on the Western Front  When I read All Quiet on the Western Front in high school, I was much too young and naive to understand what the author was trying to say. Remarque's novel does not paint military grunts as heroes, nor does he make one side seem better than the other. What he does show is the tragic deterioration of a man's soul, the dehumanizing effects of war, and the unnecessary sacrifice of so many lives for seemingly ridiculous goals.   The scenes early in the movie wherein a schoolteacher eggs on 18-year-old Paul and his classmates (urging them to enlist for the honor of their homeland) offers a sharp contrast to the scene, several years later, when Paul returns to the classroom -- a disillusioned soldier who is utterly disgusted to see his former teacher still trying to sell his students on the glory of war with no idea of the living hell he will be creating for them. From a cinematic standpoint, one can't help but be impressed by the war scenes (which were filmed without the help of computer generated imagery (CGI) because that technology simply didn't exist at the time). It makes one think of John Houseman's advertisements for Smith Barney. (""They make money the old-fashioned way -- they earn it!"") At nearly 153 minutes in length, Milestone's film certainly qualifies as an epic. However, this is a very different genre of war film from more recent blockbusters (which have become a form of military porn). It's a story about wasted humanity rather than whose side is right in any given war. To read more of George Heymont go to My Cultural Landscape",America,surprise,1776
"The United Methodist’s Judicial Council, its highest court, has declared that the consecration of Bishop Karen Oliveto violated church law. Why? Not for lack of personal virtue or dedication to her calling. Bishop Oliveto is a married woman, and by all accounts, a passionate member of the clergy.   Trouble is, she married a woman. To anyone free of ancient prejudices, the injustice of condemning Oliveto is plain. How can love be wrong? How can love enfolded in commitment and fidelity be wrong? What possible harm can her marriage cause? Not even the claim of setting a “bad” example holds water. People do not choose their spouses on the example set by clergy. If they did, there’d be no Catholic children, and poor, sultry Elizabeth Taylor could never have married even once. But Oliveto’s act of commitment, the Judicial Council found, stands in contradiction to a 1972 amendment to the denomination’s Book of Discipline, which states that “self-avowed practicing homosexuals are not to be certified as candidates, ordained as ministers, or appointed to serve in The United Methodist Church.”  Why not? “The practice of homosexuality,” it says, “is incompatible with Christian teaching.” And what teaching would that be? Oh, you know, the “Good Book.” The one that has God thundering in Leviticus 18: “Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.” And that’s only one of several such verses. Clear enough, right?  Well, not really. First of all, since we’re talking about Bishop Karen Oliveto, we must note that there’s no mention here, or anywhere in the Old Testament, about woman lying with woman.  Ah, but the keen-eyed reader asks, what of the New Testament? Well, there things become more complicated. In 1 Romans, Paul looses a tirade about some unnamed people who turned their backs on God and indulged in, er, Roman-style orgies. Things got so wild, he says, that “God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature.” (1 Romans 26, KJV). In a few other places, Paul huffs and puffs about those who “abuse themselves with mankind,” but there is no other mention of women at all. Is the vague verse above enough to go on? United Methodists who cite it have a hypocrisy problem. If Paul is the “Christian teaching” that overrides informed, reasoned, and compassionate justice, then how can the denomination turns its back when that sexless saint from Tarsus declares: “To the married I give this command—not I but the Lord—that the wife should not separate from her husband ... and that the husband should not divorce his wife” (1 Corinthians 7:10-11, NRSV). Jesus provides a loophole for men, but is generally down on divorce: “And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for unchastity, and marries another commits adultery.” (Matthew 19:9, NRSV) Now, that’s clear! But when the Bible hits home for heteros, United Methodists go all squishy: “when a married couple is estranged beyond reconciliation, even after thoughtful consideration and counsel, divorce is a regrettable alternative in the midst of brokenness. We grieve over the devastating emotional, spiritual, and economic consequences of divorce for all involved.” Yeah, yeah, keep ‘em in your prayers. But ban divorce? Nuh-uh. So, am I arguing for Methodists to follow the lead of Rome and double down on hypocrisy by doing away with divorce and adding annulments? Of course not.  I am trying to help you see that the Bible may be many things — historical treasure, poetical comfort, and sacred scripture — but as a moral guide, it is hopeless. Some claim to follow its commands literally, but they deceive themselves. No one can do so, for the Bible is a hodgepodge of contradictions and morally obscure or outrageous injunctions.  A few examples: the Ten Commandments include a prohibition against graven images, yet in Exodus 25 God orders Moses to oversee the creation of two golden cherubim to decorate the Ark of the Covenant. One time exemption? Maybe, but show me a church bare of statuary, stained glass windows, or a framed portrait of Jesus. Oh wait, you say “graven image” means “foreign idol”? Come to exegesis! And just as well, ‘cause there’s a lot that needs interpreting away.  Like slavery, or selling one’s daughter, or in the tragic event that she is raped forcing her to marry her rapist, or genocide against those who worship differently, or stoning to death a rebellious child (how has any Christian survived his teenage years?), or the silencing of women, or the sin of weaving clothes out of different threads ... on and on it goes.  Look at the Bible with fresh eyes, and you’ll find the record of ancient peoples who, lacking any police force, detectives, or proper jails, did their best to construct rules for getting along with each other and used the fear of God to enforce them. Look even closer and you’ll find that those in power often bent the rules in their favor. I suppose God might have wanted the people to heap silver, gold,  and fatted calves on their priests, exempt them from any real work, and give them a retirement plan (Numbers 7 - 8), but I find it more likely that the priests themselves heard the Word of God that way. Which brings us back to the present. I’ve shown that the United Methodist Church is interpreting the Bible to privilege the heterosexual majority while sanctimoniously applying ancient “laws” in a questionable way to Bishop Oliveto. But more important, I hope I’ve shown that Methodists, and all other religionists, would do well abandon the effort to apply scriptural codes to contemporary life. Draw inspiration, by all means, but recognize that  the hard work of thinking through right and wrong remains a moral duty for us all. ",those,Look,favor
"The first time I was sexually assaulted, I was 11. It was on a train, and nearly every member of my immediate and extended family was there when it happened. In particular, every male figure in my family. It didn’t make a difference. On that train ride most of my family was standing, and I sat next to a man who was the only person in the cart who wasn’t related to us. He was a stranger, though he was coincidentally Vietnamese as well. I had a large box on my lap that covered my legs and within a few short minutes, felt fingers rubbing the sides of my left leg. It was gentle, subtle enough to make me even wonder if it was really happening. It was definitely happening. This man was rubbing the leg of an 11-year-old child, right in front of her family. I said nothing. I did nothing. I was frozen. When the train got to the man’s stop, he stood up, said goodbye in Vietnamese with a tip of his hat to my family, and went on with his day. My guess is he never thought of me again. I, of course, have never ever forgotten him. One of the men in my family looked over to me and asked if the man had been touching me. My face flushed and I couldn’t bring myself to speak. I nodded silently. I didn’t know anyone had seen it, and I wondered why, if someone had, they didn’t stop it. The person who asked me if I was touched said they weren’t sure if it was actually happening, so they didn’t say anything. My uncles and cousins went berserk. They said to me, “Why didn’t you say something?! We would have beaten the shit out of him ― he wouldn’t be walking right now!” Everyone other than me talked heatedly about what happened until the end of ride: What they would and could have done, what I should have done... a bunch of hypotheticals that wouldn’t have stopped the incident or made it any better. I remained silent. My mother came over to me, grabbed my face and said, “Don’t you ever let anyone touch you like that. And if anyone ever does, TELL ME. I’ll kill them.” I nodded, still not saying a word. Even the steadfast strength of my mother couldn’t make me feel at ease. We got back home and I retreated to a room alone, where I burst into unstoppable tears. And the worst part about my tears was that even today, I’m not sure if I was crying over the assault itself or the feeling of embarrassment and shame I felt when I was chastised for not saying anything. I was mortified, scared, confused, and blamed myself for it all. After all, I was the one who didn’t even know if I was being touched, and I was the one who let it happen without a peep. It was my fault. There was a number of things wrong with this scenario. You could take your pick of any part of the story and you’d end up in the same place: It’s entirely fucked up. I do not know if what happened and my reaction as a child was the result of an inherently quiet Vietnamese culture or an American culture of silence on sexual abuse, but I know the combination of the two led to a worst-case scenario: A child was abused and she said nothing. So both cultures cannot continue as they are. Not if other children are to be protected. I wish I could continue this story to say that from then on I never stayed silent. But to do so would be a brazen lie. Instead, I have gone on to experience numerous sexual assaults and countless scenarios of sexual harassment, all worse as I got older, and all about which I have said and done nothing. Until now. I’m changing the story as a write this. I’m saying something. I speak up today to stand with all women who have been sexually harassed, abused, exploited, and denigrated. I speak up to stand with all the women who are part of the #MeToo movement right now and always, who will no longer accept silence as the norm. I speak up for the women who don’t have the privilege of a platform, like I do. I speak up for the men who want to be allies but who have been complicit in the silent assaults and harassment of girls and women. It’s time for you to speak up with us, too. It’s time for you to condemn the inappropriate, inexcusable, non-consensual sexual acts of abuse committed by your fellow men. It’s time to start believing women when they speak up. It’s time for the benefit of the doubt and empathy to belong to the victim, and never again to the perpetrator. It never should have taken multiple women to come forward until someone believed them about Bill Cosby, Harvey Weinstein, and any other man in power who exploits and abuses their position. The only way to enact change is to do it together as allies who say, “This is not, nor will it ever be, okay.” It’s our responsibility to speak for the women who will still stay silent for whatever their reasons and we owe it to the young girls who should feel safely empowered enough to come forward when it happens to them. They should never be warned of the repercussions of speaking truth to power. They should only be encouraged to speak, even if it takes them a long time to do it. We can’t wonder why women take so long to come forward if doing so will mean they’ll have to face as much scrutiny as their abuser. We can’t ever tell them that their time to speak is limited, so that when they find the strength to, they can tell their story with impunity. Women who are stepping out of the shadows to tell their stories are starting a brave, bold movement. It’s a movement of sisterhood, and it’s a request for help from male allies, because the truth is, we absolutely cannot do it alone, nor do we deserve to. It’s a movement for future generations of girls who we hope won’t ever feel the need to retreat and cry their tears alone in shame. It’s a movement to stop the silence surrounding sexual abuse and to take it even one step further, which is even to halt abuse entirely. The tides are shifting, and we won’t drown in our stories anymore. Instead our stories will be our buoys, and we will all survive by speaking them out loud. #MeToo, women... I am with you.",they,say,anything
"My dear friend Larry Payne mentioned that he had just purchased three watercolor paintings, so I arranged a visit to this exciting new artist's atelier. Based in Culver City, CA, Donna Quesada finds inspiration in nature. Towering over her home studio are two giant sycamore trees that she says are the sole survivors of what was once a line of 122 brothers and sisters. Intertwined among them now are various other plants and trees, such as palms, umbrellas and even banana trees.  Donna showed me her paintings and the first thing I noticed was that some of her exquisitely ornate watercolors had a slightly Asian feel. Donna said that she loves to work with a special Japanese ink called sumi-é, which she often uses alongside watercolor. It is the sumi-é that gives many of her pieces an eastern feel.  Here are four of my favorites:  I loved the black trees juxtaposed by the bright leaves in ""Yellow Autumn Trees."" It is simple yet dramatic and striking, immediately conveying the feeling of the changing season.  ""Pink Blowing Tree"" was another immediate favorite. If you look closely you can see layers of splattered paint in myriad colors bursting off of the canvas and making the painting feel dynamic and alive. I loved the paradoxical mood created by the dark ink background with the brightness of the sky and the tree. This is a very exciting painting.  With the sycamores above the studio, it is easy to see how ""Sycamore Tree"" came into fruition. The upward perspective was dizzying and enticing; it made me feel as if the tree was reaching towards the infinite.    With its subdued palette of earthy colors and speckled snow, ""Boy & Dog in the Snow"" is a vivid impression of a winter day in the woods.

"From Vetstreet: Regular cats have five toes on their front feet and four on their back, for a total of 18. But polydactyl [pronounced pol-ee-dak-til] cats boast more toes, usually on their front feet. If the word ""polydactyl"" sounds like Greek to you, that’s because it is — the Greek root poly means ""many"" and daktylos means ""digits or toes."" The record holder for most toes was a kitty named Jake, who had a whopping 28. American writer Ernest Hemingway was a lover of polydactyl cats. He was given his first polydactyl cat, a white six-toed feline named Snowball, by a ship's captain; today, nearly 50 of Snowball's descendants still live at the Hemingway Home in Key West.  Polydactyl cats are known by many names, including “Hemingway cats,” a reference to Snowball and her famous owner. They are also referred to as “mitten cats,” “big-foot cats” and “six-toed cats” — or even “cats with thumbs.” Common Questions
New York veterinarian Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cat Specialists tells us a little more about polydactyl cats, including his own, Mittens. Why do some cats have more toes than others? Some cats have extra toes because they inherit a gene that codes for polydactylism. If one parent is polydactyl and one parent has normal feet, then 40 to 50 percent of the kittens will also be polydactyl. What is thumb cat polydactyly? Most polydactyl cats have extra toes that look like the other toes — there are just more of them. Thumb cat polydactyly is a condition where the first digit, or the dewclaw, is so large that it resembles a thumb. My cat, Mittens, has huge “thumbs” on both front feet. Which cats are more likely to be polydactyl? Right now, there’s no certain breed of cat that is more or less prone to being polydactyl. However, in the past, the original Maine Coon cats had a high incidence of polydactylism — about 40 percent. More on Vetstreet:

"The boroughs of New York City — The Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island — have existed in their present form since the consolidation of New York City in 1898. In the interim 119 years, the city has radically transformed; the individual boroughs are now inter-connected in ways that would have been unimaginable at the time of their formation. A vast network of bridges, tunnels and the largest rapid transit system in the world connect the populations, establishments, and institutions of each borough — to say nothing of the connections enabled by the explosion of digital and mobile technologies. In this article we explore what happens when we abandon this century-old partitioning and remap the city to reflect the realities of New York City in 2017. Using data from dozens of different sources and techniques from a wide range of technologies and disciplines including computer vision, natural language processing, statistics, machine learning, network science, topology, architecture and urbanism, we constructed a new partitioning of the city that resonates with our contemporary moment — 5 boroughs for the 21st century. Formation of the Boroughs When New York City was consolidated in 1898, forming a city of 3.4 million, the term ‘borough’ was adopted to describe the five constituent areas brought together under the consolidation. Each borough was represented by a ‘borough president’, an elected officer who sat on the New York City Board of Estimate, an 8-member governing body responsible for budget and land-use decisions which also included the Mayor, the Comptroller and the President of the New York City Council. Connection of the Boroughs With the exception of Queens/Brooklyn, all boroughs are separated from one another by water. The implications and limitations of this physical partitioning of land have changed considerably since the initial formation of the boroughs. New York City is now connected by over 2000 bridges and tunnels, the vast majority of which were built after 1898. The formation of the boroughs also predated the opening of the New York City subway system by 6 years. The ambition to connect the boroughs of NYC via subway was made clear in the naming of the first subway company to operate in the city: The Interborough Rapid Transit Company. From its first day of operation (when it transported over 150,000 passengers) to it’s current status as the busiest rapid transit rail system in the western world, the New York City Subway has had a radical impact on the life of New York City and the mobility of its denizens. Disenfranchisement of the Boroughs as a Unit In 1989 the Supreme Court unanimously declared the NYC Board of Estimate to be unconstitutional. This decision was made on the grounds that Brooklyn (pop: 2,504,706 according to the 2010 census) had no greater representation than Staten Island (pop: 468,730), thereby violating the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. In the wake of this decision, the NYC Board of Estimate was abolished, and most of its governing responsibilities were transferred to the New York City Council, which consists of members drawn from a much more granular partitioning of the city with 51 council districts distributed (unevenly) across the 5 boroughs. Thus, while the constituent council districts of a borough have substantial political power in the New York City government (via their representative council members), the boroughs as a unit have far less political significance. We formed Topos earlier this year to advance the understanding of cities through the interconnected lenses of data and artificial intelligence. While there are well-known tools such as the United States Census that use manual techniques to collect information about different locations, using data and AI enables a dynamic, highly granular, and globally scalable understanding of place — an understanding we think is valuable given the rapidly evolving nature of cities and neighborhoods around the world (the US Census, for example, takes place every 10 years, divides the country into 9 regions, and only covers the US). Furthermore, we were interested in going beyond more familiar demographic viewpoints to capture the personality of a place, and what it feels like to actually be there. In a sense, we’ve developed a ‘psychographics’ of neighborhoods. As part of this endeavor, we have constructed a suite of features and indices about neighborhoods and cities that encompasses everything from topological analysis of urban form, to ambient light levels, to the prevalence of craft cocktails within a neighborhood. From this starting point, we decided to re-envision what a five borough partitioning of NYC might look like in 2017 using techniques from Artificial Intelligence: vector construction, dimensionality reduction, and clustering. Looking at our new 5 borough mapping of New York, one thing is immediately clear: geographic boundaries and proximities are much less important than they were in the original boroughs. With the exception of the green cluster, all other clusters are spread across a minimum of 3 of the original, geographically defined boroughs, and divided by at least one body of water. There is also a clear pattern of concentric rings radiating from downtown Manhattan, despite the fact that we didn’t include commute time or distance to transport hubs as an input. In this sense, geography reasserts itself as an organizing principle of the new boroughs. On average, we find the following distances to the center of downtown Manhattan: Average distances to the center of downtown Manhattan This striking pattern of concentric, differentiated rings resonates with the formal organization of Ernest Burgess’ Urban Land Use Model, though it differs in the specific substance of the concentric rings. Alongside commuter distance, explicit economic indicators such as income, housing and rental prices were not included in our input data. Despite this, there are clear, dramatic differences that emerge when economic data is aggregated to the cluster level, with the Median Household Income of cluster 1 (101,555 USD) almost triple that of cluster 4 (35,828 USD). Given the intertwined nature of commute time and income inequality, it is perhaps unsurprising that capturing one of these factors implies the other. Heavily built up, Vertical borough, Highest establishment density The smallest of the new boroughs as measured by both population and area, Minhattan is also the densest in several regards. In addition to being the most densely populated (with 69k residents/square mile), Minhattan has a higher density of most types of establishments (from museums to nightclubs) than any other borough. Alongside this incredible commercial, institutional and population density there is a corresponding absence of the natural world. While the collection of neighborhoods brought together in Minhattan are tightly bound by geography, it is also interesting to consider the close-by neighborhoods that are excluded. In particular, Riverside South (Trump Place) stands apart from Minhattan (For a more in-depth discussion of the singular nature or Riverside South within the context of Manhattan’s westside, see our article Rethinking ‘distance’ in New York City) Expensive, Commuter-oriented The Ring tightly hugs Minhattan, and on average is the closest borough to the center of Minhattan, with housing prices to match: after Minhattan, it is the most expensive borough to buy a house in. Unlike Minhattan, The Ring spans multiple rivers. It also unites isolated neighborhoods embedded in other boroughs that are quite far from the center of The Ring such as Forest Hills, Inwood and Hudson Heights. In general, The Ring has high densities across a range of establishments, and is the second densest borough after Minhattan. Half of NYC’s residents live in North Bend and South Bend, with 27.6% of the population living in the North Bend and 22.6% in the South Bend. They share remarkably similar average distances to downtown Manhattan, with South Bend neighborhoods an average of 7.92 miles away and North Bend neighborhoods an average of 7.86 miles away. North Bend is more densely populated than South Bend (46,694 residents/square mile vs 33,367 residents per square mile) which may explain another aspect of what differentiates them: South Bend has a far higher frequency of noise and party complaints. Leafy, Suburban, Spread out The Meadows is farthest away from the heart of Minhattan, and is sparser than the rest of the city in every regard. There are 12,050 people per square mile (vs Minhattan’s 69,390, a nearly 600% increase). Coupled with this lack of urban density, the natural environment asserts itself more strongly in The Meadows, a feature we detect using image recognition technologies. Additionally, image recognition algorithms discern the frequent presence of traditional suburban style houses in The Meadows, revealing a side of New York City that is less frequently presented in depictions of the city. As with many new technologies, data and AI based partitioning can be used to both positive and negative ends. Enabling a new level of strategic gerrymandering and malapportionment is an undeniable risk. We also believe the cultural, ecological, institutional and architectural diversity of New York City is an incredible strength and should be celebrated. At the same time, understanding how groups of neighborhoods are connected by a common set of challenges, environmental conditions, spatial configurations, or cultures, enables a more informed, granular approach to the city — whether this means developing strategies to address noise pollution, deciding where to open a farmer’s market or finding an apartment. Furthermore, New York City is already divided. 119 years after their original formation, despite a significant diminution of political power within the New York City government, the boroughs of New York are semantic units that powerfully shape the way many people perceive the city — not to mention the rest of the world. At the least, we hope this data-driven partitioning challenges static simplifications of what ‘The Bronx’, ‘Brooklyn’, ‘Manhattan’, ‘Queens’ or ‘Staten Island’ means. New York City has changed radically over the past 119 years, and will continue to do so, as will cities across the world. In this regard, we end with a correction of the title — rather than ‘5 boroughs for the 21st century’, a more appropriately dynamic title would be ‘5 boroughs for June 19th, 2017’.

"During her concession speech on Wednesday morning, Hillary Clinton urged the crowd, “Let us have faith in each other, let us not grow weary, let us not lose heart, for there are more seasons to come. And there is more work to do.” She was absolutely right. The presidential race brought out some of the worst of American society, exposing the racism, sexism and xenophobia that persist despite the country’s advances. It pitted religious groups against one another, caused “significant” stress in more than half the population and often gave Americans little to have faith in. Some even had actual nightmares over the course of the election. Now that the results are in, the task of healing is more critical than ever.  Episcopal churches around the country hosted 48-hour prayer vigils leading up to Tuesday’s election as a way of bringing people together across the political divide. “We must pray for a peaceful transition, no matter the outcome of our elections,” Massachusetts Episcopal bishops wrote in a statement. Vigils, gatherings and frank conversations will likely continue in the months and years to come. But first, a transition into healing and reconciliation can start with each person individually. Here are seven tips for embarking on spiritual recovery now that the election is over: According to psychologist John M. Grohol, Psy.D., healing after such a bitter election season must begin at home. “Now is the time to apologize for such remarks and acknowledge that some elections can be more acrimonious and frustrating than others,” Grohol wrote on PsychCentral. “But it is no excuse not to treat others with the same respect we all want and deserve.” Over the course of his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump made countless dangerous and derogatory comments about women, Muslims, Latinos and a host of other marginalized groups. Many religious and spiritual traditions have practices of charitable giving and reaching out to those in need. The groups Trump disparaged will likely continue to be targets of bigotry long after this election ― and these are some ways you can help. We live in an increasingly pluralistic society where the chance of knowing or encountering people from very different backgrounds is high. That is, if we make the effort to reach out. It’s all too easy to stay in our personal bubbles and either love or judge others from afar. But the Christian teaching to “love your neighbor as yourself” takes some actual effort ― and it’s crucial now after an election that pitted Americans against one another.  “We should be willing to forgive our former opponents,” wrote theologian Robert Franklin in an Oct. 12 article on Religion News Service. “Authentic faith also reminds us of the importance of humility and not assuming that one party or one tradition possesses all truth.” Gratitude ― a practice embedded in most faith traditions ― has deep healing power. If you’re still boiling from some of the things that went down during this presidential race, let gratitude be a cooling balm. There are many ways to develop a regular practice of gratitude, but an easy way to start is by jotting down three things you’re grateful for in your life. Spending time in the great outdoors has been shown to dramatically reduce stress and improve a person’s mood. And who couldn’t use a break from social media for a bit? Give yourself the gift of spending some quality time with nature, sans phone or laptop. Go for a hike. Jump in the ocean. Cleanse yourself however you need to in nature’s healing essence. The issues we face are immense, but in some ways they’re also microscopic. For the scientifically-minded, remember that Earth and all normal, observable matter make up less than five percent of the universe. For those with deeply held religious convictions, there may be a God, or Great Spirit, or universal power watching over us. In either case, there’s a bigger picture to keep in mind -- and it's up to us to make our little patch of the universe a better place.",It,pitted,faith
"HOUSTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The Houston Astros escaped a thrilling home-run filled clash with a 13-12 extra-innings victory against Los Angeles Dodgers on Sunday to be one win away from their maiden World Series title. After blowing a three-run lead in the ninth inning during which they had the Dodgers down to their final strike, Houston closed out one of the wildest games in World Series history when Alex Bregman hit a walk-off single in the 10th inning. “Back and forth, the two best teams in baseball fighting to the very end and going toe to toe with each other,” Bregman told reporters. “Everybody was used on both teams, pretty much, every single player. It was special for us to come out on top.” What were you doing at 23? @ABREG_1 is doing THIS. #WorldSeries pic.twitter.com/FS3u4XxTJw Each team had their left-handed aces on the mound to start the pivotal fifth game of the best-of-seven series but both the Dodgers’ Clayton Kershaw and Astros’ Dallas Keuchel failed to produce the pitchers’ duel many had expected. By the time the final out was recorded in a game that had it all and kept the capacity crowd on their feet most of the way, the Dodgers and Astros had combined for a whopping seven home runs, including a trio of three-run blasts. The Astros, who lead the series 3-2, now have two chances in Los Angeles to win their first World Series championship since the inception of the franchise 55 years ago. “We knew going into this series, this is the best offensive ballclub that we were going to see all year. And they can slug you. They spoil pitches. They’re athletic. And credit to them,” said Dodges manager Dave Roberts. “But our guys did the same thing. They just got the hit when they needed.” After rallying back from four, three and one-run deficits, Houston finally pulled in front when Jose Altuve’s run-scoring double made it 9-8 just two batters after George Springer tied the game with a solo shot. Carlos Correa’s two-run homer before the inning was over stretched the Astros lead to three but Dodgers shortstop Corey Seager doubled in a run in the top of the eighth to pull his team to within 11-9. That. Just. Happened. #WorldSeries pic.twitter.com/go9TqpX5fI On a night when no lead was safe, the Astros fans remained a tense bunch even after Brian McCann’s eighth-inning homer gave the Astros their biggest lead of the night, 12-9. But the drama was only getting started as the Dodgers stormed back in the ninth compliments of Yasiel Puig’s two-run shot and a run-scoring single from Chris Taylor before sending it to extra innings. Kershaw, who enjoyed a pitching masterclass in the series opener, was locked in early but the wheels came off and by the time he left the game had allowed six runs and four hits with two strikeouts and three walks over 4-2/3 innings. Keuchel also had a rough night as he loaded the bases in the first before a Logan Forsythe single scored a pair. The Dodgers added another before the frame was done and Keuchel left the game after allowing four runs on five hits through 3-2/3 innings. “It’s hard to put into words all the twists and turns in that game, the emotion, doing it at home, in front of our home crowd,” said Astros manager A.J. Hinch. “Just exactly what you expect to come to the park with Keuchel and Kershaw pitching. Just a perfect setup game for a bunch of runs,” he added jokingly. Houston, we have a win! #EarnHistory #WorldSeries pic.twitter.com/Ni0FoebOsE Game Six is scheduled for Tuesday in Los Angeles where the Dodgers will send Rich Hill to the mound while the Astros will counter with Justin Verlander.

"Call it Cavalia 2.0 if you wish. With 120 permanent employees, 65 horses (40 of which perform in most shows), 365 costumes, a 125-foot tall Big Top that seats more than 2,000 spectators, 200 moving lights, 19 projectors, a 17,500-square foot stage made from 10,000 tons of dirt, sand, and stone, and a man-made 40,000-gallon lake, Odysseo is a knockout production worth seeing as much for its horses, acrobats, aerialists, trick riders, and dancers as for its design, stagecraft, and use of current technology. Unlike the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus (which moves its two shows around the country each year in specialized 60-car trains), transporting Odysseo between cities requires 100 vehicles, eight shower stalls for the horses, and a 250-ton crane to lift the 70-ton technical grid into place. Over a year's time, Odysseo's horses will eat 18,000 bales of hay, 18.7 tons of grain, and 1,800 pounds of carrots. Odysseo is the creation of Cavalia's founder and artistic director, Normand Latourelle, whose dreams have been brought to fruition with the help of director Wayne Fowkes, set designer Guillaume Lord, costume designers Georges Lévesque and Michele Hamel, lighting designer Alain Lortie, and a team of choreographers (Darren Charles, Elsie Morin, Mathieu Roy, and Alain Gauthier). Michele Hamel (who worked on designing the costumes for Odysseo with the late Georges Lévesque) explains that: The gymnasts have several costume changes during the show: one is a free interpretation of African pants. Some of the trousers were inspired by Asian and Chinese tribes and, of course, we wanted colors. The costumes had to be very comfortable and not slippery because the gymnasts (who are originally from Guinea, Africa) do lots of very tricky moves. The durability of the fabrics (with regard to frequency of use and strength of movement) was a constant concern because the costumes will be on tour for a long time. The challenge in the conception of the costume for riders is to create something that will be original and lasting even when noble fabrics are used. We had to find a fabric that looked like silk, but was resistant to water, with nice colors and not too stiff. For this show we used stretch linen and faux fur. The first time we tried one of the costumes for the female riders in Nomads, the horse was scared by the fluffy sleeves of the corsage until he came near and smelled it and probably discovered it was not a living animal.  A scene from Odysseo (Photo by: Color-ish Company) Whether one thinks of stage spectacles produced by Cirque du Soleil, some of the world's great opera companies, or scenic elements which have become trademarks of some Andrew Lloyd-Webber musicals (the giant truck tire in Cats, the falling chandelier in The Phantom of the Opera), the creative team for Odysseo came up with one sequence which I don't expect anyone to surpass in the near future. Toward the end of Act I, a fully-functioning carousel descends from the grid above the main stage. As some of the male acrobats perform on the carousel poles, it continues to slowly spin around, creating a breathtaking display of art, gymnastics, and showmanship.  The carousel sequence from Odysseo (Photo by: Shelley Paulson) Because digital scanning technology has come so far since the first production of  Cavalia: A Magical Encounter Between Human and Horse in 2003, the visual design by GEODEZIK for Odysseo is nothing less than breathtaking. Whether one is watching the horses perform in a countryside where the mountains seem to dance from one side of the stage to another -- or seeing the giant head sculptures (moai) from Easter Island zoom up in size, as if to say ""We're ready for our close-up, Mr. DeMille!"" -- the visuals are remarkably rich. My favorite sequence takes place in the African desert and savanna, with flocks of birds flying out of the trees as the seasons slowly change from spring to summer and winter.  Horses performing in Odysseo's watery finale
(Photo by: François Bergeron)  The real stars of Odysseo are, of course, the horses. In the first scene, I was dazzled by the beauty of a black and white American paint horse. One of my favorite moments in the show is a quiet segment at the top of Act II which begins with the horses lying down with their riders and trainers. One by one, the audience sees the horses rock from side to side on their backs until they gain enough momentum to get into a position from which they can stand up.  Horses surround the African acrobats in Odysseo
(Photo by: François Bergeron)  It would be folly to ignore the sheer athleticism of Odysseo. In addition to the riders and trainers, there are two sets of acrobats. The Africans do some jaw-dropping stunts and interact with the audience during a musical chant that asks for an end to war. The white acrobats draw gasps of astonishment with their displays of powerbocking on spring-loaded jumping stilts similar to the ones used in the following video. What amazes me about Odysseo is how efficiently its creative team has managed to fill the vertical as well as horizontal space in front of the audience. From acrobats gallivanting across the stage on jumping stilts to muscular male gymnasts doing poetic pole dances, from nine male aerialists simultaneously performing on hoops above the stage to a cluster of angelic women being lifted on high, the spectacle is stunning. Throw in a carousel that can be raised and lowered on cables and you've got yourself quite a show. As if all the talent on display were not enough, when it comes to eye candy there is a veritable banquet of beefcake with plenty of biceps, triceps, and abs to feed an audience's fantasies.

"By Kate Stringer Why was her fourth-grader holding a medical school exam prep book? That was Radha Subramanyam’s first reaction when she looked over her daughter Tara’s shoulder as she studied the human circulatory system. It wasn’t really an MCAT book, just a science book from the new school Tara had recently transferred into. Still, the diagrams of the heart had far greater detail than anything Tara had brought home before.  “I remember commenting, ‘What, you’re going to [study] that?!’ ” Subramanyam recalled. But Tara wasn’t fazed. Instead, “she rattled off everything that happens to the blood and the inferior vena cava and the superior vena cava and all of this information in a second.” Tara attends BASIS Independent Brooklyn, part of a chain of 27 public charter, private, and international schools in five states, Washington, D.C., and China that recently captured four of the top five spots on U.S. News and World Report’s annual ranking of America’s best high schools. BASIS makes advanced, immersive coursework a requirement for all students, from pre-K through high school — an approach that some dub “deep content.” But for co-founder Olga Block, there’s nothing extraordinary about such comprehensive study; it’s simply the way she was taught as a child growing up in Czechoslovakia.  Now nearing its 20th anniversary, BASIS has molded its curriculum, and built its considerable reputation, around this “deep content” model — as well as other best practices imported from abroad. Taking the lead from nations that score at the top on international exams, BASIS adopted matriculation tests that kids must pass to advance to the next grade; following Korea’s focus on educator credentials, BASIS insists that its teachers be experts in their fields and boasts a teaching corps where 70 percent of instructors have at least a master’s degree in the subject they teach; adopting Finland’s approach of boosting attentiveness through play, BASIS gives its youngest students extra recess; and following Olga’s experience in Prague of students owning their learning, BASIS gives kids a communication journal to transport between home and classroom — making students responsible for updating their parents on lessons, priorities, and grades rather than providing an online academic portal.     It’s a complex stew of a school design, and one that seems to be connecting with students like Tara. On international tests, BASIS schools are beating those top-performing countries they’ve borrowed from. The four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate for BASIS’s charter schools is 98 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Education. (BASIS says it doesn’t have college persistence rate numbers but is working toward this goal.) The network’s schools score better on PISA-based tests than the top-ranking countries do. Meanwhile, average U.S. scores on these exams have remained stagnant in the middle of the pack.  Families see almost immediately that expectations are high. Tara, now a fifth-grader, is already learning algebra. Her brother, Rohan, and his third-grade peers are studying Mandarin; Tara is learning Latin. By the time she is in sixth grade, she’ll be taking nine classes — including biology, physics, and chemistry. When she’s in high school, she’ll take an average of 11 AP courses and, if the school’s pattern holds, pass with flying colors. She’ll spend her entire senior year working on her capstone, which involves an intensive research project and an internship or similar off-campus placement studying an area of interest, from inefficient food aid systems in the Middle East to the ethical implications of campaign finance reform.  It’s a challenging model of education — something BASIS’s founders have touted over the past two decades — and attrition rates indicate that it’s not for everyone. Critics decry BASIS’s exacting standards and emphasis on testing. But at a time when American schools are often derided as too easy compared with the classroom rigor found in other countries, some parents and students seem ready for more.  In fact, Subramanyam was already dissatisfied with Tara’s city public school when her daughter discovered BASIS by accident a few years ago at an outdoor fair in Brooklyn. After sampling the activities at the school’s booth, she told her mother she wanted to transfer in — which was fine with her mom, who grew up in India and was worried about the lack of emphasis on math and science that she saw in U.S. schools. For their family, BASIS is providing an answer. “There are times when it seems a little bit challenging, but children are more than capable of doing more than we give them credit for,” Subramanyam said, remembering her initial shock over her daughter’s science book. “That was one of those ‘aha!’ moments.” The story of BASIS and its founders is also the story of a marriage, said Mark Reford, BASIS’s chief business development and brand officer. Olga and Michael Block were economics professors who met in 1992, when Michael was teaching a seminar in Austria that Olga attended. Michael was American; Olga had grown up in Prague, when her country was still called Czechoslovakia. They got married, and Olga moved to the States in 1996. But she became increasingly concerned by the lack of rigor in the schools attended by her daughter, Petra, in Arizona. At the same time, Michael was noticing that the international students in his classes at the University of Arizona were always much better prepared than their American counterparts. So, in 1998, the Blocks decided to start their own charter school in Tucson. They were K-12 outsiders and adopted practices that many criticized as too difficult. A second school, in Scottsdale, opened in 2003, followed by a third Arizona school in 2010. BASIS has opened multiple schools every year since. As the network expanded, it also drew attention for high attrition rates, leading critics to question whether BASIS was for all students. In a 2006 Arizona Republic article, Olga tells of a sixth-grader who bombed her matriculation exam. She asks Olga if she has the legal right to fail her. “ ‘Yes, baby, I do,’ Olga recalls saying. ‘If you don’t like the rules, please don’t come.’ ” The article added that 40 percent of the eighth-graders at the Tucson school decided not to attend the neighboring BASIS high school. The issue arose again in 2013, when Washington, D.C., refused to allow BASIS’s year-old charter school there to expand, citing attrition as one reason. Then–Head of School Paul Morrissey told The Washington Post that BASIS schools always have higher attrition in the first year, as the community becomes accustomed to the high level of academic rigor. “When a BASIS school comes into a new market, there are students who understand and know what the workload is and what it takes to be successful at BASIS, and there are students who are not prepared to do that kind of work,” he said. But BASIS has made some changes to help students adjust, such as starting science instruction in the younger grades and stretching some Advanced Placement courses over two years. BASIS Independent Brooklyn, which opened in 2014, reports that 93 percent of families returned to the school last year. “I think the distinguishing factor for successful students is that they’re willing to work hard and that they’re invested in academics,” said Julia Toews, the network’s vice president of academics. “It’s really a program designed to make success achievable for the average student now.” BASIS Independent Brooklyn, one of five private schools run by the network, has an admissions exam. But the majority of BASIS schools — 21 — are public charter schools that admit their students by random lottery. “Deep content cannot just be for the smartest kids,” Reford said. Overall, the nearly 18,000 students at BASIS — which operates in New York, Texas, California, Virginia, Arizona, Washington, D.C., and Shenzhen, China — are 40 percent white, 35 percent Asian/Indian, and 25 percent Hispanic, African-American, and multiracial. BASIS says it does not track family income, but its two San Antonio charter schools report that 6 to 7 percent of students are economically disadvantaged, while the D.C. school reports a rate of 20 percent. And the network is growing. A private school in Manhattan is set to open this fall, and an international school in Prague is scheduled for 2020. “S-T-U-D-Y. It’s study time and you know why!” On a February morning, students at BASIS Independent Brooklyn watched, wide-eyed, as history teacher Matthew Goldman stomped his feet and shouted the words to a song he’d projected on the whiteboard for the students to sing. Some kids giggled too hard to speak. One pulled his hood up in feigned embarrassment. Still, they clapped along to the silliness, and soon their chanting began to feel like a rallying cheer before a big game. That’s because there would be a big game, the following week. The pre-comp exam, sort of like a midterm, was coming up, and it was worth 5 percent of the middle schoolers’ total grade. The test covered everything they had learned so far and demonstrated how ready they would be for the comprehensive exam they’d take at year’s end. The comp is worth 50 percent of the overall grade, and a passing score is required for grade advancement.     Kate Oldre, BASIS Independent Brooklyn’s director of student affairs for grades 5 to 10, walked through the halls the week before the pre-comp, pointing out what classes were doing to prepare for the exam. Though it’s a big test, the mood was light in most classrooms. Students were laughing, running up to their teachers to check answers, and shouting questions to their classmates. None of them had been assigned homework that week, so they could spend time studying. “There’s no such thing as a high-stakes exam if you are prepared,” Oldre said. The following week, elementary students filled the hallways with posters to encourage their older peers. “I hope you have a good test! Do your best!” one said, in scrawling red handwriting. Another depicted a green dinosaur with “100% A+” tattooed to its side. Algebra teacher Jessica Wolf wore a green shirt that read “Keep Calm and Show Your Work.” At BASIS, there is no social promotion. Middle and high school students advance to the next grade only by passing their classes and year-end exams (BASIS has a weighted formula for calculating AP scores into student grades and shares that with colleges). If students don’t pass, they get one chance to retake the comprehensive test over the summer. “Holding kids to that mastery has been one of the main reasons for our success,” Toews said. BASIS high schoolers are required to take six AP exams (the network pays the fees for charter school students), but the average student takes 11.5, earning an average score of 3.7; 84 percent pass with a 3 or higher. Nationwide, in 2016, 57 percent of students passed their AP exams; the average score was 2.85. Testing for mastery and matriculation is a staple of the world’s top-performing nations, including the Czech Republic, Japan, Korea, and Finland. According to a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, countries that require students to pass standards-based exams in order to move to the next grade or enroll in college score 16 points higher on the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) exam than those that don’t. So it may not be a surprise that when Amanda Ripley, author of The Smartest Kids in the World, surveyed 202 foreign exchange students for her book, she found that 9 out of 10 international students who studied in the U.S. thought American schools were easier than schools in their home countries. Seven of 10 American teenagers who went abroad agreed. “School in America was many things, but it was not, generally speaking, hard,” Ripley wrote. A recent Brown Center Report on American Education found similar results. In her book, Ripley gave BASIS a shout-out for its international testing performance, while describing demanding schools like it as “countercultural places, though, with leaders spending a lot of time telling parents their students are tougher than they think.” But with that rigor comes passion. Senior year is devoted to letting students discover a subject they are passionate about, research it intensely, and then create a presentation on their findings. This idea originated from Toews’s experience working with undergraduates who had great SAT and AP scores but “lacked a fundamental ability to be interested” and wanted detailed instructions for everything they did.     For one project, a senior at BASIS Tucson North Charter School went to live with her grandparent for three months in Poland, where she worked in a lab studying genes in a microscopic worm. Another student, who was born in India but lived in Silicon Valley, studied how the local bike-sharing program compared with the one in his birthplace of Bangalore. “The kids, they came back grown up,” Towes said. “They were self-possessed.” Getting into a teachers college in Finland is as difficult as getting into MIT, according to Ripley, who studied Finland’s education model for her book. In Finland, teachers spend years studying the subject they will teach, in addition to learning instructional techniques. In Korea, elementary school teachers are some of the most highly educated professionals in the country, coming from universities that admit only the top 5 percent of applicants, according to Ripley. BASIS’s founders wanted to bring this level of educator prestige — which Michael Block has called the “secret sauce” — to U.S. classrooms. So he and Olga decided to hire only teachers who had a degree in the subject they were teaching, to evaluate them based on how well students perform, and to pay bonuses for good work. Now, more than 70 percent of their teachers have at least a master’s degree in their subject area. Teachers serve as professional resources for one another, collaborating within and across schools to share best practices or teaching materials. Expert teachers scattered around the network serve as subject advisers on the shared curriculum, provide their own online syllabi for new teachers to copy or modify, if they wish, run webinars, and hold monthly Skype conversations. “It’s those people who are actively teaching in the classroom who have their finger on the pulse of what is working and what is not working,” Toews said. Being able to collaborate across the U.S. and internationally has helped BASIS teachers create better exams: When the network realized its in-house tests had too many American cultural references for students at the Shenzhen campus to understand, it changed the questions. BASIS also splits up its elementary teachers in a co-teaching model called LET/SET, or Learning Expert Teachers and Subject Expert Teachers. LETs are responsible for one group of students, sitting in on most every class with them and making sure they understand the material and stay on task. SETs teach the subject classes, able to specialize in one discipline and take the time they need to prepare lesson plans because they share responsibility for their students. In an open-air space inside BASIS Independent Brooklyn’s building, elementary school students race around in their winter coats, tumbling over large blue blocks that they’ve constructed into a sort of fort. Playtime is one of the simplest of BASIS’s borrowed global best practices. In Finland, students get a 15-minute break for every 45 minutes in class, which researchers have found increases attentiveness. BASIS gives its kids in grades K-3 three 15-minute blocks of playtime throughout the day, in addition to lunch, physical education, and a morning snack. Another simple tool comes in the form of an 8½""-by-11"" spiral notebook owned by every BASIS student that, at first, drives parents crazy.     Many schools create an online grade portal that allows parents to see how their children are performing. BASIS doesn’t. Any information about grades comes to parents because their kids have shown them the contents of their planner, which contains test scores, homework assignments, and notes to see the teacher after school for help. This idea, which originated from Olga’s experience as a student in Prague, is designed to make students responsible for their own learning. “If they’re working for someone else, they’re never going to be successful,” Toews said. “If they’re working for themselves, they can take that skill anywhere.” She recalled when her daughter was a fifth-grader at BASIS Tucson North, where Toews was the principal. Her daughter brought home a test on which she had received a D, a first for her. The test required mom’s signature. “I looked at her and said, ‘Well, what are you going to do?’ and she responded, ‘Oh, I’ve assigned myself to go see the teacher on Thursday,’ and she had written it in her planner,” Toews said, noting that this system makes students take responsibility for fixing problems. “Rather than [seeing it as] a terrible failure, ‘Oh, there’s a solution, and it’s in my planner.’ ” A few months ago, Subramanyam’s daughter, Tara, stood on stage in front of a red curtain. The fifth-grader twiddled a microphone cord as she glanced at her notecards, then whipped through facts about pollution in China and India. But her main point took a more personal tone. “When we go outside on a normal school day to recess, we take the air that we breathe in for granted,” she said, staring into a camera. “Well, Chinese can’t do that. It’s unhealthy for them to breathe the air. Some children are wearing gas masks to school because the air is so horrible.” Tara’s presentation was the culmination of a new BASIS extracurricular called the Cultural Ambassadors Program. In partnership with graduate students from Columbia University, the BASIS kids researched global issues and recorded video presentations on their findings.     The program is one step toward creating what the network hopes will be a more empathetic student population ready to tackle global issues. Another is the Global Classroom Project, which connects kindergartners in different BASIS schools virtually to help them learn about one another. In one project, the children exchanged pictures of their local grocery stores so they could compare them. They also sent the Shenzhen school a video of second-graders sharing a Lunar New Year greeting in Mandarin. The plan is to expand the Global Classroom Project with each grade, so the students grow up alongside their national and international peers and have a global connection to them. “We want them to think about the world and their place in the world at a young age,” said Ross Cunningham, who leads the project at BASIS Independent Brooklyn. “We want kids to solve problems and understand what everyone’s problems are other than just their own.” BASIS is also going beyond virtual connections to give students firsthand experience with different cultures. This year, the Brooklyn school is hosting its first visiting student from China, and the network plans to begin an international exchange program among BASIS schools. “We wanted students to focus on something outside of their own worldview to see a larger world,” said BASIS Independent Brooklyn Head of School Hadley Ruggles. “There is something beyond just your ZIP code.”",Olga,were,that
"Fox News host Laura Ingraham returned to the airwaves on Monday, ready to fight what she described as the “left’s propaganda.” But by Tuesday morning, it seemed her week-long Easter vacation wasn’t long enough to stop the flood of sponsors pulling their ads from “The Ingraham Angle” over comments she made about school shooting survivor David Hogg. Meal delivery service Blue Apron and dietary supplement maker SlimFast both ran spots on “The Laura Ingraham Angle” on Monday. But amid questions from media outlets and angry posts from customers on social media, both companies announced they would no longer do so in the future: We were unaware that our ad would be running on The Laura Ingraham Angle last night. We will no longer be advertising on the show, and will be working with our media buying partners to more closely monitor where our ads appear going forward. We have stopped advertising on the Laura Ingraham show and have no plans to resume in the near future. We are also monitoring all ad placements carefully. IBM, the lone blue-chip advertiser on Ingraham’s program, told The Wrap on Wednesday it had also pulled its ad spots. Ingraham drew fierce criticism last month after she mocked Hogg, 17, on Twitter for not getting into some of his preferred colleges. Hogg responded by calling on advertisers to boycott her program. Many did so. Ingraham issued an apology on Twitter a day after her initial post, but the action did little to stem the departures. At least 19 companies have pulled their spots from the program, including Hulu, Nestle, TripAdvisor and Liberty Mutual.  Allstate also quietly dropped the show, saying her comments were “inconsistent with our values.” In contrast, some companies ― including My Pillow ― announced that they had no intention of pulling their ads. My Pillow ran two spots on Monday.

And images that were taken during a flight on April 14 over the Beaufort Sea, 50 miles northwest of the Mackenzie River Delta, showed a series of unusual shapes in the sea ice.  “We saw these sorta-circular features only for a few minutes today,” mission scientist John Sonntag wrote from the field, per NASA. “I don’t recall seeing this sort of thing elsewhere.” NASA also released an image with the main features labeled:  NASA said some of the features had an easy explanation: The ice in the area was young and thin.

"Companies need to have rules—that’s a given—but they don’t have to be shortsighted and lazy attempts at creating order. I understand the temptation. As my company has grown, so has our difficulty maintaining standards. There have been many instances where someone crossed a line, and we were tempted to respond with a new rule that applied to everyone. But that’s where most companies blow it. In just about every instance, upon closer inspection, we realized that establishing a new rule would be a passive and morale-killing way to address the problem. The vast majority of the time, the problem needs to be handled one-on-one by the employee’s manager. When companies create ridiculous and demoralizing rules to halt the outlandish behavior of a few individuals, it’s a management problem. There’s no sense in alienating your entire workforce because you don’t know how to manage performance. It makes a bad situation that much worse. Here are some of the worst rules that companies create when they fall into this trap. 1. Bell curves and forced rankings of performance. Some individual talents follow a natural bell-shaped curve, but job performance does not. When you force employees to fit into a pre-determined ranking system, you do three things: 1) incorrectly evaluate people’s performance, 2) make everyone feel like a number, and 3) create insecurity and dissatisfaction when performing employees fear that they’ll be fired due to the forced system. This is yet another example of a lazy policy that avoids the hard and necessary work of evaluating each individual objectively, based on his or her merits. 2. Ridiculous requirements for attendance, leave, and time off. People are salaried for the work they do, not the specific hours they sit at their desks. When you ding salaried employees for showing up five minutes late even though they routinely stay late and put in time on the weekend, you send the message that policies take precedence over performance. It reeks of distrust, and you should never put someone on salary that you don’t trust. When companies are unnecessarily strict in requiring documentation for bereavement and medical leave, it leaves a sour taste in the mouths of employees who deserve better. After all, if you have employees who will fake a death to miss a day’s work, what does that say about your company? 3. Restricting internet use. There are certain sites that no one should be visiting at work, and I’m not talking about Facebook. But once you block pornography and the other obvious stuff, it’s a difficult and arbitrary process deciding where to draw the line. Most companies draw it in the wrong place. People should be able to kill time on the Internet during breaks. When companies unnecessarily restrict people’s Internet activity, it does more than demoralize those that can’t check Facebook; it limits people’s ability to do their jobs. Many companies restrict Internet activity so heavily that it makes it difficult for people to do online research. The most obvious example? Checking the Facebook profile of someone you just interviewed. 4. Banning mobile phones. If I ban mobile phones in the office, no one will waste time texting and talking to family and friends, right? Ya, right. Organizations need to do the difficult work of hiring people who are trustworthy and who won’t take advantage of things. They also need to train managers to deal effectively with employees who underperform and/or violate expectations (such as spending too much time on their phones). This is also hard work, but it’s worth it. The easy, knee-jerk alternative (banning phones) demoralizes good employees who need to check their phones periodically due to pressing family or health issues or as an appropriate break from work. 5. Draconian e-mail policies. This is a newer one that’s already moving down a slippery slope. Some companies are getting so restrictive with e-mail use that employees must select from a list of pre-approved topics before the e-mail software will allow them to send a message. Again, it’s about trust. If you don’t trust your people to use e-mail properly, why did you hire them in the first place? In trying to rein in the bad guys, you make everyone miserable every time they send an e-mail. And guess what? The bad guys are the ones who will find ways to get around any system you put in place. 6. Stealing employees’ frequent-flyer miles. If there’s one thing that road-weary traveling employees earn, it’s their frequent flier miles. When employers don’t let people keep their miles for personal use, it’s a greedy move that fuels resentment with every flight. Work travel is a major sacrifice of time, energy, and sanity. Taking employees’ miles sends the message that you don’t appreciate their sacrifice and that you’ll hold on to every last dollar at their expense. 7. Pathetic attempts at political correctness. Maintaining high standards for how people treat each other is a wonderful thing as we live in a world that’s rife with animosity and discrimination. Still employers have to know where to draw the line. Going on a witch-hunt because someone says “Bless you” to another employee that sneezed (real example) creates an environment of paranoia and stifled self-expression, without improving how people treat each other. 8. Shutting down self-expression (personal items and dress code). Many organizations control what people can have at their desks. A life-size poster of a shirtless Fabio? I get it; that’s a problem. But employers dictate how many photographs people can display, whether or not they can use a water bottle, and how many items they’re allowed to place on their desks. Once again, it’s the ol’ “If I could just hire robots I wouldn’t have this problem” approach. Same goes for dress codes. They work well in private high schools, but they’re unnecessary at work. Hire professionals and they’ll dress professionally. When someone crosses the line, their manager needs to have the skill to address the issue directly. Otherwise, you’re making everyone wish they worked somewhere else because management is too inept to handle touchy subjects effectively. Bringing It All Together If companies can rethink their policies and remove or alter those that are unnecessary or demoralizing, we’ll all have a more enjoyable and productive time at work. What other policies drive you bananas? Please share your thoughts in the comments section, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me. Want to learn more?

"Mexican authorities have deported a polygamist disciple of Warren Jeffs back to the U.S., where he faces law enforcement scrutiny in three slayings. Two of the victims were his sons. Orson William Black, 56, was turned over to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers, then to police in El Paso, Texas, last week, authorities said. Mexican authorities detained Black this month at his compound in Chihuahua, where they said he was living with four wives, a “concubine” and 22 others, including several children. Almost 100 Mexican police, along with agents of the FBI and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, stormed Black’s homes in the Rancho El Negro compound and seized him. They said they found scores of preserved exotic animal heads and carcasses, including zebras, buffaloes, red foxes, black squirrels, a lion and a bear rug, and elephant feet, suggesting Black’s group was involved in wildlife and trophy trafficking, according to the Chihuahua Attorney General’s Office. Black is suspected in the murders of two teenagers, who have been identified as his sons by the Chihuahua attorney general, and a 23-year-old man, according to Mexican authorities. The victims ― all U.S. citizens ― are brothers Michael Black, 15, and Robert W. Black, 19, and Jesse Barlow, 23, the BBC reported. Their bodies were found this month on the sprawling compound. They had no birth certificates, according to Mexican authorities. “The motive has not been clarified and is still being investigated,” Felix Gonzalez, a spokesman for the attorney general, told the Los Angeles Times. A woman who said Black married three of her sisters told The Salt Lake Tribune that Barlow is Black’s stepson. She said she believes the three were fatally shot by members of a drug cartel who had been working with Black producing methamphetamine. Black fled to Mexico from Arizona 15 years ago after he was charged in the state with five felony counts of sexual misconduct with two underage girls who became his wives, according to a 2003 report in the Phoenix New Times. Black and one of the girls conceived a son they named Robert William Black, born in in 1998, who was one of the slaying victims. Black was a member of Warren Jeffs’ polygamist Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Arizona. Jeffs is serving life in prison for sexually assaulting two underage girls he took as “brides.”",he,deported,slayings
"By Ingrid Lunden Amazon has made no secret of its ambitions to expand into more fresh food services, from its own, homegrown efforts like AmazonFresh for groceries (first launched in 2013) and Amazon Restaurants for restaurant delivery (first launched in 2014), through to its most recent plan to acquire Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. In fact, the company has its sights set on a number of other culinary areas, such as the development of its own farm-to-table products, Blue Apron-style meal kits, and other food fixes to help it better tap the $800 billion grocery opportunity. Last week, as we nosed around the various trademarks that have been registered by Amazon to see if we could find anything linked to a new messaging app we believe it is working on, we stumbled upon a number of food-related trademarks. Amazon this month filed a trademark (serial number 87517760) for “We do the prep. You be the chef,” which relates to a meal-kit service similar to the kind offered by Blue Apron and others. The filing is classically Amazon in its competitive boldness: it is dated July 6 — coming just days after Blue Apron’s rocky IPO. Blue Apron is down by 10.4 percent in trading this morning, very close to its lowest point. Amazon describes the service simply: “Prepared food kits composed of meat, poultry, fish, seafood, fruit and/or and vegetables and also including sauces or seasonings, ready for cooking and assembly as a meal; Frozen, prepared, and packaged meals consisting of meat, poultry, fish, seafood, fruit and/or vegetables; fruit salads and vegetable salads; soups and preparations for making soups.” It looks like we are not the only ones to have noticed this meal kit filing in the last few days. It turns out that, in fact, company in the last seven months had registered at least two other trademarks for slightly shorter versions of the same meal kit concept. Respectively, serial numbers 87418923 and 87256976 for “We prep. You cook” and “No-line meal kits,” also relate to food-kit services along with marketing related to them. (We have not yet been able to find a filing for the actual brand name of such a service, or evidence of an actual launch.) We have asked Amazon to comment on the trademarks, and we will update this post as we learn more. In the meantime, the service would line up with other moves that Amazon has made in food, where it has developed services like delivery to rival existing, popular alternatives. Amazon puts a lot of instant pressure into the market when it decides it wants to do something: incumbents have gone through the sweat of building a base of users with a demand for a product, but once Amazon comes into the game, those incumbents are hard-pressed to compete with their bigger rival on price and logistics. A meal kit service in particular also provides some proof to rumors we’d been hearing that the company had plans to build a meal kit clone, a rumor that surfaced around the time that Blue Apron filed for an IPO and intensified with the news about Whole Foods. But if trademarks tell a kind of story, Blue Apron is not the only food service that Amazon has been slowly cooking up. In all, there are 110 trademarks related to food filed by Amazon Technologies, with a strong theme of quick fixes. Amazon also has been quietly developing its own lines of pre-made food aimed at people searching for more quality ingredients. The company has, for example, around 10 trademarks filed related to the phrase “single cow burger”. To be clear, this is actually related to a product Amazon already offers, Wagyu beef burgers made from grass-fed cattle raised on a farm in California. “How many cows does it take to make one burger? Thanks to Amazon, just one,” the company writes in its marketing materials. “Our high-quality patties are made from one source and are available exclusively on AmazonFresh.” Looking through Amazon’s food-related trademarks, it feels a little odd to see such a disproportionate amount of filings related to one single item, burgers. My theory: this is a testing ground for Amazon, which is watching these burgers to see how it might expand this kind of approach and branding into more pre-prepared items. In the future, Amazon would be able to source a wider range of products more easily, thanks to its ownership of Whole Foods, so food (and wine) could be the next frontier for Amazon’s expansion of its own-label products. This is something that Amazon has already started developing without much fanfare. A filing for another trademark, for “Some eat to live. We live to eat,” is the tagline for Wickedly Prime, a new brand of snack foods and other prepared aimed at foodies that Amazon quietly launched earlier this year. The range currently features tea, chips and soups. The focus on things like meal kits, snack items, and pre-made food also fits with Amazon’s push for its express Prime membership service and general focus on convenience. That ethos is summed up in several other food-related trademarks the company filed in December 2016 for “Grab good food” and “Good food fast.” Serial number 87256879 is quintessentially Amazon, very short and to the point: it is “Redefining fast.” This article originally appeared on TechCrunch.com.",company,writes,materials
" The power of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman is undeniable. The story of Willie Loman and his lost sons is a stirring commentary on the dark, underbelly of the American Dream.  In the New Yiddish Rep's version -- with English supertitles -- a remarkable cast beautifully captures its raw, realistic pathos. Avi Hoffman delivers a tour-de-force portrait of Willie Loman -- and attention must be paid. Now at the off-Broadway Castillo Theater, this stellar production underscores what Arthur Miller admitted 50 years after its mid-century debut: The Lomans are a struggling, working-class Jewish family in Brooklyn. Even if, in his words, they are ""light years"" from their roots. (An earlier version of Miller's play centered on a salesman named Schoenzeit, not Loman.)  Of course, all Americans can identify with Willie; but hearing this 1951 translation of Toyt fun a Seyslman brings home the power of a generation desperate to achieve success -- and the pressures it put on its children to surpass expectation. ""A salesman is got to dream, boy, it comes with the territory."" Thematically meaty, the story of 60-year-old Willie Loman is an archetype of American overreach. He dreams big, but his salary, due to his reduced circumstances, can't cover his bills. Working for the same company for nearly 40 years, Willie is a traveling salesman who crows about his popularity, but whose final destination is oblivion. Unlike his brother Ben, who ""went into the jungle at 17 and came out at 21 with gold,"" neither Willie nor his oddly nicknamed sons, Happy  (Lev Herskovitz) and Biff (Daniel Kahn), are risk takers. Or share the same vision. The boys dream small and squander opportunity. Security, the promise of American business, is trumpeted. But business, in the guise of his boss (Adam Shapiro), has its own ruthless agenda.  ""Salesman"" is all about dreams, identity and family turmoil. Muscular, likable men rival intellectual achievers like neighbor Bernard (Ben Rosenblatt) in the battle for social and economic supremacy. Wife Linda (a standout Suzanne Toren) often a meek, shadowy figure in Salesman productions, is resolute throughout -- fierce in her devotion to her husband. She's willing to turn her sons out at the end, even knowing Willie's days are numbered.

Little wonder Salesman hit home. It addresses primal worries: losing a job, living in crowded environs, the fear that life has passed you by. Whether you see yourself or a family member or the sorrow of America's promise, Death of a Salesman skewers the myth of America's promise.  The production is part of the 100th anniversary of Miller's birth. Two of his most produced plays will appear on Broadway this season: A View From the Bridge and The Crucible, his McCarthy-era allegory. The 1951 Yiddish Salesman adaptation by Joseph Buloff is a testimony to the enduring strength of Miller's masterpiece. Performed on a bare set, save for a table and chairs, the New Yiddish Rep's revival is riveting. Brilliantly calibrated by director Moshe Yassur, who gets exceptional performances from his cast, this version is not to be missed.  On a lighter note, the musical Hell's Belles, now at the Elektra Theater at the Times Square Arts Center, revels in camp. It's an entertaining romp with a simple premise: The audience is spending a moment in hell, entertained by a bevy of famous women.   Hell isn't good or bad, it's all about ratings. And some of the most intriguing women, from Eleanor Roosevelt to Janis Joplin, Judy Garland to Gertrude Stein, make their debuts. Marilyn Monroe is ""dead and sexy, everything a legend out to be,"" while Salome is introduced as ""the trash is taking itself out."" A medley of musical genres is neatly performed and parodied -- cabaret, country, rock 'n' roll -- all resulting in a devilishly good time. A talented trio (Lindsey Brett Carothers, Laura Daniel and Rachel Erin O'Malley) portray various roles, all introduced with appropriate Las Vegas-style patter by Lester (Matt Wolpe), Satan's rep. There are the usual corny jokes, augmented by a few zingers - ""Only Andrew Lloyd Webber could turn the wife of a tyrant into a star"" -- and some sassy social commentary on the capricious nature of celebrity and the vagaries of history. Whether sending up Eva Peron or the bitchiness of Hollywood divas, Hells Belles is a zippy musical revue. The hardworking crew, directed by John Znidarsic, may be in hell, but the entertaining romp is earthbound fun. Photos: Death of a Salesman/Ronald L.

"Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney made a powerful statement Thursday morning during the sentence hearing of former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University team doctor Larry Nassar. Maroney, who alleged in October that Nassar began sexually abusing her when she was 13, was not in court. Michigan state Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis read the gymnast’s victim impact statement as a photo of Maroney at the 2012 Summer Olympics hung behind her.  Maroney, 21, wrote about starting gymnastics when she was 18 months old and entering her first competition when she was 7. She said making the U.S. National Team at 14 was “remarkable and amazing,” but that it came with a price.  “I was told to trust [Nassar], that he would treat my injuries and make it possible for me to achieve my Olympic dreams,” the statement said. “Dr. Nassar told me that I was receiving ‘medically necessary treatment that he had been performing on patients for over 30 years.’ As it turns out, much to my demise, Dr. Nassar was not a doctor, he in fact is, was, and forever shall be, a child molester, a monster of a human being. End of story.” More than 140 women ― including Maroney’s former teammates Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas and Simone Biles ― have accused Nassar of molesting them. Nassar pleaded guilty in November to 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct. “He abused my trust. He abused my body and he left scars on my psyche that may never go away,” Povilaitis read from Maroney’s statement.  “For me, the scariest night of my life happened when I was 15 years old,” she continued. “I had flown all day and night with the team to get to Tokyo. He’d given me a sleeping pill for the flight, and the next thing I know, I was all alone with him in his hotel room getting a ‘treatment.’ I thought I was going to die that night.”  She wrote that Nassar also abused her twice while she was competing in the 2012 Olympics. Maroney called for several organizations to be held accountable for allowing the abuse to go on for so long.  “A simple fact is this: If Michigan State University, USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee had paid attention to any of the red flags in Larry Nassar’s behavior, I never would have met him, I never would have been ‘treated’ by him, I never would have been abused by him,” she said.  The statement ended on a strong note: “Our silence has given the wrong people power for too long, and it’s time to take our power back.” Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said she hoped Maroney and her mother were watching a livestream of the court proceedings.   “Thank you, McKayla. I think you have just taken your power back along with your sister survivors,” she said. “Your voice for change and accountability is being heard.”  The sentencing hearing for Nassar began Tuesday and is set to run through Monday. Povilaitis said 105 victims and their family members are scheduled to read impact statements throughout the hearing. Nassar is already serving a 60-year sentence on child pornography charges.  Maroney signed a confidentiality agreement with USA Gymnastics in December 2016, as part of a $1.25 million settlement that required her to keep quiet her allegations against Nassar. She violated that agreement when she tweeted about the abuse last fall, which opened her to the possibility of having to pay steep fines. Model Chrissy Teigen recently said she would be “absolutely honored” to pay those fines. However, USA Gymnastics released a statement saying the organization “[would] not seek any money” from Maroney if she spoke during Nassar’s hearing. ",she,said,survivors
"Colorado has been a leader in protecting and expanding access to women’s health care. In April 1967, Colorado passed the nation’s first state law allowing safe, legal abortion. It was a bipartisan bill, passed in a majority-Republican legislature. In recent years, the state has emerged as a model for dramatically reducing unintended teen pregnancies by expanding access to long acting reversible contraception and supporting policies to expand access to reproductive health care information and resources. Access to reproductive health care is good economic policy. As Sandra Day O’Connor wrote in the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision, “The ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives.” In Colorado, our forward-thinking policies reflect who we are ― pro-choice. We recognize that the freedom to make your own personal, private medical decisions is a right that belongs to the individual, not the government. That freedom from government intrusion into personal decisions transcends a number of issues. The Casey opinion also reaffirmed the rights found in Roe decision, stating “Roe determined that a woman’s decision to terminate her pregnancy is a ‘liberty’ protected against state interference by the substantive component of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.” Seven in 10 Americans back Roe v. Wade, and that number holds all across the states, from the reddest part of Kansas to the bluest part of New York, including the districts some appear to be worrying about. Standing firm on the ability to make a personal decision about women’s access to abortion care without interference from politicians is even stronger. If you want to focus on winning elections, take a lesson from Colorado. In a state split evenly between Republicans, Democrats, and Unaffiliated voters, we have tested this theory across three elections ― including two mid-terms ― with attempts to overturn abortion rights via “personhood” ballot measures. Every time, anti-choice efforts have failed by landslide margins statewide ― including the county adjacent to Colorado Springs ― in 2014. The General Assembly has repeatedly rejected attempts to restrict abortion and reproductive rights, and in 2017 we passed measures *increasing* access to contraception, which received national accolades. At a time when we are seeking pro-choice Republicans to step forward as candidates, it is troubling to see national Democrats signaling a willingness to compromise on the issue of anti-choice Democratic candidates. Among voters, we can identify clear majorities that support choice on both sides of the aisle. Our message is simple: leave the decision to the women, their families, their faith and their doctors. Do not attempt to restrict access to abortion care. This is not a litmus test. It is a civil rights issue. The voters don’t want it. Voters can differentiate between the right of an individual to make a decision on abortion, and the government making it for her. It’s not a matter of belief. It’s a matter of laws and public policy. Bluntly, Republicans recognize being anti-choice is a losing proposition. Sen. Cory Gardner ceded the issue in 2014 when he pretended to be pro-choice and denied the existence of a federal personhood bill he co-sponsored. Gardner has since cast multiple anti-choice votes in Congress. But he knew if he campaigned on being anti-choice, he would lose. This is where the argument that there are “some districts” where you cannot be pro-choice falls apart. There is no data to support that. When will we stop treating an issue with 70 percent support as controversial? Access to abortion care is a critical part of women’s health care, and the attacks on access to care across the states is already putting women’s lives and health in jeopardy. The rise of anti-abortion forces coupled with the fear of our allies to engage is precisely what led us to this place. In the same way progressive messages and values have been demonized, abortion has been vilified alongside health care, social services, and human rights. In the same way we need to continue to push forward and stand for what’s right on values-based issues, we cannot yield on abortion access. As Lindy West put it in the New York Times, “Democratic candidates are perfectly welcome to refrain from terminating their own pregnancies. But to be anti-choice on a policy level is absolutely indefensible from an economic justice, racial justice, gender justice and human rights standpoint. And if the Democratic Party does not stand for any of those things, then what on earth is it?” In 50 years, NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado has seen a lot of battles over abortion rights. Our organization grew out of bipartisan support for legalizing abortion in 1967, so we are somewhat of an authority on the subject. We know Coloradans are with us. And we believe in holding candidates and public officials accountable on supporting our Constitutional right to choose abortion. And we will keep doing that ― for Republicans and Democrats alike.",that,recognize,individual
"Over 265 young girls and women have accused former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University team doctor Larry Nassar of sexual abuse under the guise of medical treatment.  Judge Janice Cunningham announced the updated number on Wednesday in a Charlotte, Michigan, courtroom during Nassar’s second sentencing hearing ― on three additional counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree.  “We have over 265 identified victims and an infinite number of victims in the state, in the country, and all over the world,” Cunningham said in the small courtroom Wednesday morning.  The three counts Nassar is being sentenced for include two girls between the ages of 13 and 15 years old, and one who is under 13. The charges focus on specific allegations of sexual abuse at a gymnastics club in Dimondale, Michigan, called Twistars. Nassar pleaded guilty to all three counts in November and is expected to receive a minimum of 25 to 40 years in prison.  Last week, the disgraced physician was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison on seven child sexual abuse charges. Nassar is a serial child sexual predator and has pleaded guilty to digitally penetrating young athletes while treating them as a medical doctor. His youngest survivor was 6 at the time of the abuse. He’s already serving 60 years on child pornography charges.  A large number of the 265 identified survivors are the 156 women who read their impact statements in court during Nassar’s weeklong sentencing hearing that began on Jan. 16. Another 65 survivors are expected to read impact statements during this hearing, which is expected to go into next week. Cunningham noted in court that she expects that number to increase as the hearing continues.  About 30 women read victim impact statements in court on Wednesday, either in person or via video message, or had their statement read by a representative from the attorney general’s office. Many of the women said they were inspired to come forward with their stories after listening to the 150-plus women give their impact statements last week.  “No high schooler should have to know the inside of a court as well as I do,” victim and former gymnast Jessica Thomashow said in the first statement.  Thomashow, whose sister Amanda was also abused by Nassar, says as a gymnast she had been taught to grit her teeth and simply swallow pain, even during Nassar’s “treatments.” “Larry Nassar is evil,” Thomashow said. “What you did to me was twisted, you manipulated me and my entire family. How dare you. ... For the rest of my life, I’m going to have to heal from what you did.” Watch survivor and victim Annie Labrie give her impact statement below.  Another former gymnast, Tiffany Dutton, says she came forward with her story because of the “courage and bravery” of the other women who have already accused Nassar. Dutton said her mother was in the room when Nassar molested her. “It takes a monster to sexually assault a child,” she said. “But it takes a monster backed by ego, experience and power, fueled by multiple institutions, to sexually assault a child in front of their own mother.”  An anonymous survivor, identified only as victim No. 124, called out MSU in her statement.  “Larry you might not remember me but I certainly remember you,” an assistant to the attorney general’s office read the statement. “You ― Larry Nassar ― used and abused my body for years for your own sexual gratification. ... MSU, I’m looking at you too. Lou Anna I know you resigned but you owe me and the other survivors one hell of an apology.”  Several officials at USA Gymnastics, MSU and the U.S. Olympic Committee have resigned in the face of harsh criticism. MSU President Lou Anna K. Simon resigned last week. The entire USA Gymnastics board resigned, and former Olympic coach John Geddert retired. The NCAA also opened an investigation into how MSU handled the Nassar case. On Tuesday, Congress passed a bill that aims to protect young athletes from sexual abuse and regulate governing bodies of amateur sports.  Nassar’s sentence will be handed down sometime next week. ",assistant,remember,statement
"From the primitive chariot to the modern day automobile, the designs have changed over the years from slow and cumbersome to fast and aerodynamic, and everything in between. In all that time, we have never seen this kind of artistic interpretation and this special model of  automobile being incorporated together as a canvas for fine art. This inspiration and implementation happened because of Sir Alfred J. DiMora.  Sir Alfred DiMora showed a special enthusiasm for cars at ten years old when he began to race miniature slot cars, which led to a genuine passion for the automobile. By the time he was thirteen, he dreamed of building his own car, and, like most genuine passions, simply would not let go until the goal was realized.

DiMora/DiMora Motorcar. DiMora admits being 'pushed over the edge' after seeing the film ""American Graffiti,"" which he has viewed over a dozen times and was instrumental in motivating him to design and build his own custom, high-performance automobiles. Who would have known that decades later he would have the pleasure of meeting Bo Hopkins (""Joe,"" the leader of the ""Pharaohs"" greaser gang in the movie), and they remain good friends to this day.  In a recent interview that I did with Bo, he said, ""In those days, the cars, often modified, lowered, customized and beefed up, had a distinct style and integrity that simply does not exist with today's cars, until now.""  Sir Alfred J. DiMora, his wife, Yvonne DiMora, George Barris (designer/builder of famous Hollywood custom cars), and actor Bo Hopkins (""American Graffiti""). Photograph courtesy of Sir Alfred J. DiMora/DiMora Motorcar. DiMora began rebuilding engines and transmissions; he studied books on 1930s Roadster designs; and attended welding and machinist programs. He was ready to go after his dream, and at eighteen, drove from New York to California with a drawing, a vision, and $400 in his pocket. His target was prestigious Santa Barbara, where he slept on the beach those first few weeks. He found his first job there as a machinist and worked part-time at a gas station. He soon was building luxury cars at Clénet Coachworks, Inc., where he was one of the first employees. Not long afterwards, Alfred co-founded the Sceptre Motorcar Company with a small group of people who shared the same ambition of building the Sceptre 6.6S. His first prototype won ""Best of Show"" in the 1978 Los Angeles Auto Show. By that time, DiMora was able to buy out the Clénet Coachworks and set up his own factory in Carpinteria, California. He revived  manufacturing the Clénet Series II Cabriolet and the Series III Asha, and created the Series IV Sportster.  Clénets were hand-built and sold to celebrities, royalty and other motor-enthusiasts around the world.  Some of these included Sylvester Stallone, Rod Stewart, Julio Iglesias, Farrah Fawcett and King Hussein of Jordan, just to name a few.

The Clénet was called ""Drive Art"" by Automotive Age and the ""American Rolls Royce"" by Fortune magazine; DiMora and the Clénet also were honored at the Automotive Hall of Fame that same year. DiMora recently began to see an uptrend developing in both the art and automobile investment genres, so he envisioned merging the two to see if they could be combined successfully, developing a paradigm to build on the strength of both the art and automobile worlds. Just as Dale Chihuly's unique, hand-blown glass art helped change the typical paint and canvas art platform, so will this innovative blending of art with the automobile, in DiMora's professional opinion.  After a great deal of research, DiMora discovered the work of Taiwanese artist and Zen Master Lee Sun-Don at the Beverly Hills X-Power Gallery. ""Master Lee has been described as the ""modern Asian Picasso."" When visiting Beijing in 1989,  Master Lee Sun-Don found discarded, centuries-old doorknockers, which represented Chinese traditional craftsmanship. This saddened him, so he began collecting and preserving on canvas these rare antiquities, calling them the Great Treasure Gate series.

""The Chinese antique doorknocker has been a symbol of the rich and powerful since ancient times, especially the dragon (which represents royalty), and the lion (which serves as its guardian), hence 'the royal guards,'"" he said. ""I decided to utilize a great number of lion's-head doorknockers in my collection and they have now come to good use in this series."" Sun-Don is world-renowned and was invited to participate in the 53rd Venice Biennale, as well as impressive venues at the Royal Institute of Oil Painters and numerous other gallery exhibitions.  When DiMora viewed  the explosive, vibrant colors and the uniqueness of the doorknocker paintings, he easily pictured Master Lee's Totemic Energy Art on the Vicci 6.2 hood and side panels, and the rest is history. DiMora didn't know what to expect, but the success of their first joint collaboration showing at Art Revolution Taipei in 2014 was astounding, with Master Lee's art displayed on canvas and on the Vicci. Immediately, orders for their new rolling art series began selling quickly. The purchaser receives both the original canvas for their wall and the Vicci rolling art for their garage.  Crowd viewing Master Lee Sun-Don, Sir Alfred DiMora, and the Vicci 6.2 at Art Revolution Taipei 2014.  Photograph courtesy of GP Deva. When asked why he agreed to display his art on this particular automobile, Master Lee replied, ""Classic and innovative, the DiMora Vicci 6.2 is by itself a work of art. What is more, this classic supercar, with its connotations of victor and conqueror, accords perfectly with the spirit of kingship and supremacy of my painting series, 'The Great Treasure Gate.'""

DiMora said, ""This is the first time in history that a highly-acclaimed artist and a production automobile manufacturer have come together to create true rolling art. We will work together to produce a total of 25 limited edition Vicci 6.2 Emperor art automobiles, each with its unique Lee Sun-Don canvas masterpiece in the 'Great Treasure Gate' series.""   Finished collaborative art and automobile projects: Sir Alfred J. DiMora's Vicci 6.2 with Master Lee Sun-Don's painting on its hood.  Photograph courtesy of Sir Alfred J. DiMora/DiMora Motorcar. DiMora now is being approached by other world-renowned artists wishing to do a joint collaboration. With other talented artists on the horizon, even more art will be free to move about gracefully on beautiful automobiles. This successful pairing caused car and art investors to do a double-take and rethink the normal confines of standard car and art investing models. There is no limit to how far this innovative idea can go. DiMora's Vicci 6.2 rolling art will be exhibited at the Monterey Car Week, beginning August 10, 2015 at the Stanton Center. Phil Elfstrom, executive director of the event, comments on DiMora's car: ""In today's world, how do you put a value on this kind of top shelf professionalism? Where else are you going to find a car with this undisputed uniqueness?"" For more information: www.dimoramotorcar.com and http://arts.sundon.net/en/index.html",goal,dreamed,passions
"Michelle Obama is back with more great life advice.  The former first lady recently interviewed four young women from around the world for an International Women’s Day feature for Refinery29. In partnership with the Obama Foundation, Refinery29′s feature spotlighted the four teenagers from Nepal, Ghana, Guatemala and Chicago to highlight the important of empowering girls with education.  Alejandra Teleguario Santizo, a 17-year-old from Guatemala who has organized her community to rally against sexual violence, asked Michelle Obama what advice she would give to young women like herself who are looking to blaze their own paths and become leaders.  “My best advice to girls, including my own daughters, is do not be afraid to fail. So often, our own fear of failure is the thing that keeps us back,” Obama said. “We think we have to be perfect, that if we make even the tiniest mistake, it’s a catastrophe. That’s simply not true!” She added that the only way to succeed is life “is by failing and failing well.”  “You cannot let your failures eat you up or make you want to quit,” Obama said. “You have to learn from them, let them challenge and inspire you to do more ― to take some risks and to step outside of your comfort zone.” Obama also told Santizo another important key to success: Be kind to other women.  “I also advise girls to be supportive of each other. I cannot say this enough! Too often we’re taught that we have to compete, or that someone else’s failure is our success,” she said. “But we can all rise together; we can all win. We have to be a team of women and girls who love each other and value each other and cherish one another. Because if we don’t cherish each other, no one else will.” Obama and her husband, former President Barack Obama, have been working to educate more girls around the world since they launched the Let Girls Learn initiative in 2015. The program brings together several international organizations to address the variety of challenges preventing girls from getting an education.  Eva Lewis, a 19-year-old activist and artist from the South Side of Chicago (where Obama also grew up), asked her how education can be liberating for everyone, but especially girls. Her answer did not disappoint.  “I always tell students that if you focus on school right now, you will have all kinds of freedom later on in your life,” Obama said. “You’ll have the freedom to choose a career you enjoy and to earn a living that supports your family. That is truly liberating. And that’s not just true here in America.” When girls get an education, their whole world changes, Obama noted. “Right now, millions of adolescent girls around the world actually don’t have the chance to go to school. Imagine if, at the age of 10 or 11 or 12, someone came to you and said, ‘Sorry, you’re a girl, you’re finished with your education. Forget about all your dreams. Instead you’ll marry a man twice your age and start having babies,’” she said. “When we give girls an education, it can help liberate them from that kind of life. Educated girls marry later, have lower rates of infant and maternal mortality, and are more likely to immunize their children and less likely to contract malaria and HIV. Studies also show that girls who are educated earn higher salaries, and sending more girls to school and into the workforce can boost an entire country’s GDP,” Obama continued.” So education can liberate individuals, families, and even nations.” Head over to Refinery29′s feature and make sure to click through to read each individual interview.

"America is known as a land of not just opportunity, but also as a center of entrepreneurial innovation and a magnet for talent from all over the world. Personally, my experience as an immigrant set me up for entrepreneurial success.  My backstory: I immigrated to America from my native Bulgaria as a young college student. After graduating, I worked for five years as an engineer at Google before founding a successful venture-backed technology company, Leanplum. There are five life skills I learned from immigrating to the US that shaped me into a better CEO. Whether or not you share this experience, these skills may help you found and grow your company as well.  1. Take Risks  Immigrating is the ultimate risk. Most people can’t imagine a scarier move than leaving their home country to live in foreign land with a different language, where traditional social networks and safety nets are absent.  I moved to America in 2003 to attend college in New York. I was 19. My entire worldly belongings fit into two suitcases, and I had borrowed thousands of dollars from my family to help pay for college. But even though this was a massive risk for me and my family, it was worth it because it enabled me to pursue opportunities that I never could have achieved in my home country.  In a way, being an immigrant prepared me for the risks and stresses of running a startup. Compared to the emotional commitment of asking your friends and family to help fund your education, pitching VC investors is easy!  2. Be Resourceful  Immigrating to the US forced me to become more resourceful. Out of necessity, I constantly had to adapt, solve problems, figure things out, and generally learn how to survive and thrive in a new country.  In the same way, entrepreneurs learn every day by putting out fires, finding new solutions, and pivoting away from failure. Being an entrepreneur requires continuously adapting and taking on a mindset of 24x7 learning. At the same time, you must find new ways to solve problems and serve in every role imaginable, from CTO to CFO to customer service rep.  The best entrepreneurs, like immigrants, are relentlessly self-reliant — they proactively shape circumstances to suit their goals.  3. Believe in Your Vision  When I first arrived in the US, I learned the radical lesson of mental de-cluttering. While in college, I worked 20 hours per week in the cafeteria during the graveyard shift, the maximum time allowed to work on campus as a full-time student, all while triple majoring in math, computer science, and computational science. I only had time for working, studying, eating, and sleeping. I didn’t overthink my situation — just did what I had to do to succeed. This is the same mentality as entrepreneurship.  When I started Leanplum, I was in the same mentality as when I was 19 — non-stop coding, talking to customers, eating, and sleeping. Starting and scaling Leanplum has been one of the happiest and most thrilling adventures of my life, because it has given me the chance to pursue a specific vision for what I wanted to achieve, with focus, determination, and a great team.  4. Move Between Cultures  I’ve been privileged to understand and appreciate multiple cultures, finding ways to operate effectively across cultural boundaries. Being an immigrant has made me a better person, as well as a better entrepreneur.  Even if you never move to a new country, learning another language, working with a diverse team, and respecting unique cultural differences can help improve your sense of empathy, enhance your tolerance of ambiguity, and help you understand other people’s intentions. Being an immigrant has helped me relate to people better and given me greater confidence in working with individuals from all walks of life.  5. See Things Differently  Perhaps the greatest life skill I’ve learned from immigrating is a sense of perspective. There seems to be something about the experience of being an immigrant that makes people have a broader perspective and embrace innovative ideas. Many of America’s most innovative entrepreneurs have this “immigrant” mindset. Steve Jobs was the son of an immigrant. Elon Musk, founder of Tesla and SpaceX, Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google, and Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, are also immigrants. Immigrants have started more than half of America’s billion-dollar startup companies.    America must not lose this incredibly valuable competitive advantage. We must continue to be a welcoming place for immigrants, especially for the entrepreneurial immigrants who invest so much to start new businesses, create new jobs, launch whole new industries, and transform our sense of possibility of what life can be like.

"When I was a little kid, I had a lot of faith in you guys. Maybe I watched too many Star Trek episodes, but I figured by now -- 50 years later -- you'd have invented some miracle laser-like gizmo that could cure everything. The patient would lie down on a diagnostic bio-bed. Then the doctor would wave the gizmo over the illness-ridden body and -- presto! -- the affliction would magically vanish.  Where's the gizmo, guys? We want the gizmo. Okay, forget the gizmo. I'll settle for a Miracle Pill that does the same thing.  For decades we've been throwing money at you and, I hate to say it, I was kind of hoping for something more by now. Okay, I'm an impatient patient. Sue me.  That's not to say you haven't made some amazing advances. You've given us meds for cholesterol, ED, depression, AIDS, blood pressure and a host of other ailments; there are bionic hands, heart transplants, new vaccines, nerve regrowth, facial reconstruction, MRIs, laparoscopy and a whole lot more.  But, to cite a few examples, you still can't cure Alzheimer's; cancer, in all it's many delightful forms, still mystifies you; you haven't put the kibosh on multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, diabetes or heart disease; hell, you haven't even rid the planet of hemorrhoids yet.  Guys, we don't want to go through all that suffering anymore. We're sick of getting sick. It's the 21st Century. Stem cells were discovered in 1978. You promised us limitless possibilities, yet here we are, 36 years later, still twiddling our thumbs.  Here's how primitive we still are: Kidney patients still have to be hooked up to washing machines; basal cell carcinomas still have to be dug out by hand; skulls still have to be drilled to get to brain tumors; casts are still used for broken limbs; we still repair wounds with thread or staples; tooth extractions still require a set of pliers; amputations still involve saws; hoses explore our digestive systems; we still use catheters (the last major improvement was the flexible catheter, invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1752, hello.)  Let's take cancer. If you are unlucky enough to get pancreatic, ovarian or lung cancer, you can pretty much put a down payment on a tombstone. After decades of research, here's what we have in the arsenal: surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Not very impressive guys. Surgery is still horrible no matter how you... um... cut it; radiation is... well... radiation. Then there's the wonder of chemotherapy (invented in the 1940s.) Good job there, fellas. Poison the victim and hope that the cancer succumbs and the patient survives. What a breakthrough. Remember the old medical practice of bleeding patients to cure them of just about everything? Today, we ridicule that boneheaded procedure as hopelessly medieval. Ha ha. Guess what? A hundred years from now, scientists will get a huge guffaw out of chemo.  Where are the Pasteurs, Flemings and Salks of yesteryear? If it had taken the estimable Dr. Salk as long as it takes you, half the world's population would still think the iron lung is a marvel of ingenuity.  Here's what really bothers me: Everyday we read about your latest earthshattering breakthroughs. ""Scientists Build Liver Out of Stem Cells!"" ""Scientists Solve Mystery of Aging!"" ""Researchers Discover New Drug that Shrinks Tumors!""  Wow, I say excitedly. Finally.  Then what happens? Nothing. It seems as if none of these exciting new medical miracles ever make it from the lab to the hospital. They just seem to... disappear. We never hear about them again. What happened? Was it all just optimism? Is there a need to publish something to justify the investment? Is the FDA dragging its feet? Is Big Pharma quashing them? Are the rats faking it? What?  All I know is that my internist did not offer me a new liver the last time I saw him, not that I need one. Yet.",I,throwing,something
"WASHINGTON, July 27 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama  called into question the number of jobs that would be created  from the controversial Keystone XL pipeline in an interview with  the New York Times released on Saturday. ""Republicans have said that this would be a big jobs  generator,"" Obama said, according to the newspaper. ""There is no evidence that that's true. The most realistic  estimates are this might create maybe 2,000 jobs during the  construction of the pipeline, which might take a year or two,  and then after that we're talking about somewhere between 50 and  100 jobs in an economy of 150 million working people."" TransCanada Corp's proposed pipeline is designed to  carry 830,000 barrels of crude oil per day from the Canadian oil  sands and the Bakken shale in North Dakota and Montana south to  refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast. It would cost about $5.3  billion to build. Obama's administration is under pressure from Republicans  and business groups to approve the project because of the  economic benefits they say it will bring. Environmentalists oppose the project because of the carbon  pollution they say it would generate. Carbon emissions are  blamed for contributing to global warming. The project was first proposed in 2008 but is still making  its way through a State Department study process. The Times said Obama disputed an argument that the pipeline  would bring down gasoline prices. He said it might actually  increase prices somewhat in the U.S. Midwest, which would be  able to ship more of its oil elsewhere in the world, the paper  reported. Obama said in June the project would serve U.S. interests  only if it did not ""significantly exacerbate"" carbon pollution.  The Times quoted him as saying that Canada could potentially be  doing more to ""mitigate carbon release."" The administration's final decision is expected later this  year or early in 2014.",decision,expected,2014
"What’s an Alexis Bledel for? The actress made famous for her portrayal of Rory Gilmore tends to be typecast in roles defined by youthful naivety: Winnie Foster in “Tuck Everlasting,” Lena in “Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.” In a “Mad Men” appearance, she’s involved in an affair with Pete Campbell, who seems to like that her spontaneity foils his wife’s orderliness. Thursday, Vulture wrote that she’s been cast in a part that strays from her norm. She’ll play Ofglen, opposite Elisabeth Moss, whose starring as Offred, in Hulu’s adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale. The story follows Offred as she navigates an oppressive society, where women are forced to adhere to a chaste dress code and mate with the men to whom they’re assigned. Offred is separated from her husband and daughter, and she confides in Ofglen about the memories of her past. Ofglen’s character is no shrinking violet. She finds her subservient role in the Republic of Gilead suffocating, and acts out accordingly. The part will either be a refreshing change for Bledel, who, in the “Gilmore Girls” revival plays a character with little agency, or a missed opportunity for the show.  (It’s worth noting that Bledel’s tried out more subversive roles before; In “Sin City” she plays Becky, a member of a woman-led clan that eventually traps and kills a wayward cop.) Regardless of your thoughts on the casting choice, The Handmaid’s Tale may be worth watching for its relevancy alone. Earlier this week, the book’s author, Margaret Atwood, released a statement about the similarities between the fictional world she created and the current political climate.",spontaneity,’s,orderliness
"At the New York Daily News, the managing editor, Rob Moore, has been heard on more than one occasion offering a piece of advice to those around him: Don’t go to human resources to complain about me, or you’re out of here. “I heard that with my own ears,” said a former female staffer. “It was like his motto.” This wasn’t bluster. This was a tactic. A second former staffer said Moore for years would brag openly about punishing or firing employees who complained about him ― specifically as a warning to other would-be complainants. The message was well understood, and it reverberated around the newsroom. New York Daily News employees warned one another not to get on Moore’s “bad side,” said a third former staffer. When people did complain about Moore’s behavior, he would publicly express his anger, said three staffers. Tabloid newsrooms are known for being crude and volatile places to work, particularly for young reporters ― another top editor at the paper is also currently under investigation ― but Moore’s brand of harassment could be “more cruel” than the tongue-lashings often delivered to young reporters, said a fourth former staffer. “He always seemed like someone who revelled in having power and lording it over the people that he could,” said a fifth former staffer. A sixth added, “He had all the power there, and it wouldn’t be good to be on the receiving end of his fury.” Earlier this week, the Daily News’ new corporate parent, Tronc, launched an investigation into Moore after NPR asked the company about a sexual harassment complaint lodged against him in December, soon after he reportedly interviewed to become the newspaper’s new editor-in-chief. For many people who’ve worked with Moore, the surprise wasn’t that he had come under investigation, but that it had taken so long. “Everyone knew about this ― like, everyone,” said the first staffer. This is my me too. It’s hard. https://t.co/jrr6h4YqEA HuffPost has spoken to more than 20 current and former employees of the Daily News, many of whom asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation. “He’s an incredibly vengeful guy,” said one of them. The sources described a wide spectrum of inappropriate and threatening behavior ― both in public and in private ― by a man who abused his position of power inside the Daily News’ “frathouse” atmosphere in a way that kept many employees quiet. Moore and Tronc both did not respond to requests for comment for this article. (Note: One of the reporters on this story, Andy Campbell, interviewed for a position under Moore in 2014, when he was offered, but did not accept, a job.) Moore first joined the Daily News as a reporter in 2004. From the start, said several former employees, it was clear he had a big personality and plenty of ambition. He had a knack for editing, too, and soon rose up the masthead. “He had really, really good strengths,” said one former staffer, “and really, really horrible negatives.” In the office, he had a habit of calling employees over to show them photos of women he’d slept with, according to multiple former staffers. “When it came to his sexual harassment, it often consisted of him bragging about his sexual exploits,” one staffer said. “He would often make co-workers uncomfortable with his bragging, sometimes showing pictures — not naked pictures, but certainly suggestive pictures — of women he was with.” One staffer said Moore commented on her appearance on multiple occasions, calling her “hot” and texting her to come out after work.  “I was just very uncomfortable each time I went to the office, because I knew I had to pass his desk and then would get a text from him,” the woman said. “Most of the time I’d ignore his text, but at times I’d say I was busy and couldn’t go out because of one thing or another, so I never gave him a chance for anything worse.” At bars, he hit on waitresses, then insulted their looks in front of other employees when he got turned down, according to a former staffer. Most of the behavior was out in the open and witnessed by many. Still, Moore commanded respect in the newsroom, staffers said, and expected people to express their respect for and loyalty to him.  “If they didn’t play the game, then they would be frozen out,” said one former staffer. At least six people HuffPost spoke to used the word “bully” to describe Moore. “You’re never supposed to be afraid of your editor, but he was one of those editors who would honestly strike fear into you,” said one former staffer.  “He didn’t treat people professionally,” another former staffer said. “He would hold grudges based on stuff that had nothing to do with the office. It didn’t take him long to size you up as someone he liked or didn’t like, and it often had nothing to do with the quality of your work.” Others noted that Moore’s behavior on social media was unprofessional and “thirsty.” He took particular interest in models on Facebook, commenting publicly on their racy photos ― a practice that doesn’t necessarily violate any workplace policies, but that staffers said made them uncomfortable and was “unbecoming” of upper management.  Considering Moore’s threats about firing or laying off those who complained about him, some employees worried that any complaint lodged against him would end in their dismissal. “That’s why nobody reported him to HR ― you’d get in trouble,” said one former staffer. “You just kind of kept your head down and tried to keep out of his field of attack.” In part, multiple people said, Moore was a reflection of his environment ― a male-dominated tabloid paper where women were objectified. “The whole newsroom had this really misogynistic undertone,” said one staffer. “They were all running around behaving in terrible ways, creating a sexualized environment and a toxic environment. It took a lot of people in charge to do that.” Moore isn’t alone in being investigated. On Thursday, HuffPost confirmed that Tronc is also looking into allegations of workplace harassment against Alexander “Doc” Jones, the managing editor of the Sunday desk. Six employees HuffPost spoke to said Jones had a “pattern” of behaving creepily toward young women in the newsroom. “As a woman starting a job at the Daily News, you’re given a card key and a warning about Doc,” a current staffer told us. The accusations include multiple incidents of forcible kissing, and five employees told us that Jones had a penchant for bringing young women to his side of the newsroom for the sole purpose of ogling them. “I stopped wearing dresses to work. I stopped wearing makeup, too,” another employee said. “I purposely tried to not look like myself for fear of being summoned to Doc’s desk.” Jones was escorted out of the newsroom on Thursday by a human resources employee, but Tronc confirmed to HuffPost that he was still employed. The paper has new ownership and a freshly minted interim editor-in-chief in Jim Kirk, the former interim editor-in-chief of the Los Angeles Times. What happens next to Jones and Moore is anyone’s guess. “Media, as you know, is a tough enough biz to work in these days,” one staffer said. “It’s even tougher for women, because you have men like Rob and Doc contaminating the culture.”",he,seemed,staffer
"Don't worry about Cecily Strong, y'all.  The ""SNL"" cast member who anchored ""Weekend Update"" during the last season, has made it clear she's very happy to be stepping away from the desk when Michael Che takes over on September 27. Strong posted this message on her Instagram late Friday. I don't see this as me leaving update, just as me being on update in a looser, goofier way that is a lot more fun for me and in a way I think I'm better at. And now I get to do features with the very funny and wonderful Michael Che! No point in being angry or sad for me for something I'm genuinely happy about! Unless you are just a person who enjoys being angry or sad. Then I guess play on, playa. NBC announced on Thursday that Che, a former ""SNL"" writer who had just left the show over the summer to become a ""Daily Show"" correspondent, would be the new anchor of ""Weekend Update"" alongside Colin Jost, who replaced Seth Meyers. While Strong was still featured in many sketches, fans had lamented that as an ""Update"" anchor she was no longer able to step into some of her most beloved characters, like ""The Girl You Wish You Hadn't Started A Conversation With At A Party."" Her message to fans seems to indicate that she feels the same way, and that the change will free her up to play to her strengths as a repertory player.

"At age 74, I have already experienced many of the indignities of aging and before very long will also confront the inevitability of death. Although neither prospect is particularly pleasant, I strongly believe in the normality and necessity of both. Claims that science will soon prevent aging and dramatically prolong life strike me as irresponsible hype and false hope. I am all for efforts to expand our healthspan, but see little value in prolonging our lifespan, and little possibility that we will soon discover a fountain of youth.  My grandson, home from college for Christmas break, disagrees with what he regards as my sentimental and regressive attachment to the status quo. Tyler is participating in stem cell and genetics research and believes that it is feasible and desirable to double the human lifespan and make aging just another curable disease. Tyler has no qualms about this research and regards my doubts as technically naive and ethically unnecessary.  Here is a very brief point by point summary of our ongoing debate. Me: Evolution requires aging and death to make room for each new generation and also favors a fairly rapid succession of generations. Both are necessary to provide raw material for the variability and beneficial mutations essential to natural selection.   Tyler: Evolution has little interest in aging and death. Natural selection focuses its selective pressure on producing optimal reproductive fitness in the mating members of any species. Once the period of reproduction and weaning have passed, natural selection applies much less pressure on how the rest of the lifespan plays out. There is thus no inherent evolutionary reason to prohibit research that would prevent aging and prolong life. And there are excellent reasons to pursue it- although evolution does a remarkable job when given enough time, it works far too slowly and imperfectly to help us solve our current problems. Whenever, in the past, it has served our interests, humans have always felt free to speed up natural selection. We would still be hunters and gatherers were it not for the artificial selection of domesticated plants and animals that constituted the agricultural and pastoral revolutions. If we have the genetic tools to promote human health, longevity, and happiness, why not use them. Me: But the world is already terribly over-populated and is rapidly becoming even more over-populated. Extending the lifespan will mean more crowding, more mouths to feed, more environmental degradation, and more resource depletion. Malthusian dynamics ensure that providing a longer life for some must be purchased at the high cost of a more brutal life for the many- a life threatened by even more wars, migrations, famines, and epidemics. Tyler: Overpopulation is best solved by reducing birthrates. This has already been done with great success almost everywhere in the world except Africa and the Middle East. It will be a better, more mature, and healthier world if people live longer and have fewer diseases and fewer children. A longer lifespan will make people wiser, more future oriented, and less willing to take foolish risks in the present. This could lead to more rational decisions on how best to preserve our planet as a decent place to live.  Me: Only the rich will be able to afford new products that prevent aging and promote longevity. The resulting caste system based on lifespan will be even more unfair than our current divisions based on wealth and power.  Tyler: The distribution of benefits that will accrue from aging research is a political, economic, and ethical question, not a scientific one. Given human nature and existing institutional structures, the benefits will almost certainly be enjoyed in a markedly unequal and unfair fashion- greatly favoring the rich and powerful, with only a very slow trickle down to the population at large. This inequity has accompanied every previous technological advance in the long march of human progress and is not specifically disqualifying to progress in slowing aging and death. Me: Every scientific advance can, and usually does, have harmful, unintended consequences (medical, social, political, economic) that cannot possibly be predicted in advance. Scientists always have intellectual and financial conflicts of interest that bias them to exaggerate the potential benefits to be derived from their discoveries and to minimize the potential risks. Tyler: Surely, aging research will have its hype, blind alleys, and unexpected complications- these are an unavoidable risk in all scientific advances. But the risks and difficulties should not paralyze efforts to make the advance or call into question whether it should be made; instead, they should increase caution and vigilance in how it is done. And we must remember the context. Our world is already going to hell in a handbasket- the risks of advancing science are real, but the potential benefits may be all that stand between us and disaster. Science is necessarily disruptive, but may offer our only road to salvation. To quote Mark Watney in the movie 'The Martian': ""In the face of overwhelming odds, I'm left with only one option, I'm gonna have to science the shit out of this."" Me: There is something arrogant and unseemly about tampering with anything so fundamental to life as aging and death. Their inevitability has always been an essential element governing the ebb and flow of all the species and all the individual organisms that have ever lived on our planet. Why assume that we have the right, or the need, to tamper with such a basic aspect of nature? Tyler: Scientific progress has always challenged conservative values based on a sentimental attachment to the past. My grandfather would probably have worked hard to convince the first agriculturalists that they were breaking some sacred and natural code when they chose to settle down in one place rather than continue following the hunt. There is no inevitable, inexorable, over-riding, and natural law defining and governing one correct path of human destiny.  Me: Curing disease is the primary goal of medical science. But aging is not a disease- it is an entirely expectable wearing down, an expression of biological entropy that cannot be reversed. We should certainly target the diseases that occur in old age in an effort to extend the average human healthspan. Success will improve the well being of the elderly and have a small subsidiary effect on lifespan- eg, more people living into their 80's, 90's, and 100's. But we should not expect that better treatment for diseases will allow people to live to biblical ages. Despite the hype to the contrary, there is no reason to believe it is scientifically feasible or ethically desirable for people to stay young for 150 years. The most compelling lesson of scientific research is that the body is far more complicated and intricately balanced than we could possibly imagine. We are still at a very early stage in curing disease- there is no reason to think we can prevent decline or postpone death. Tyler: It is far too early to tell whether aging in humans is more a reversible disease or an inescapable degenerative process. But since aging is caused by biochemical processes, it most likely can be prolonged by biochemical interventions. We can't decide the question based on values and reasoning- only by actually doing the aging research will we learn whether aging is preventable. And sure it may take many decades, but that's precisely why we have to allocate the resources now to get the project off to a fast start.   Me: Unrealistic promises result in false incentives and misallocated resources. Typical example: we are investing a vast fortune on the wildly unrealistic goal of eliminating dementia within a decade or two, while taking dreadful care of the people who are already actually demented. Less hype would result in better balance between our hopes for the future and fulfilling our responsibilities in the present. Tyler: Aging is already a pressing current issue and will soon become the biggest medical problem of our future. There is no running away or putting our head in the sand. My goal is to make life longer and better for people. Sure, there are some aging researchers who are overly enthusiastic in promoting their research and in promising quick results. And we mustn't neglect the many practical problems of people who are aging today on the false hope that science will quickly and magically come to their rescue. We must find a proper balance between research investments that will pay off only in the distant future and current health care investments for those who are in need today. The future of our species depends on how we handle our demographics. The way ahead is difficult and uncertain- but that has never stopped us before. We make lots of mistakes along the way, but science helps us correct them. There is no standing pat- if we don't move forward, we will move backward. My Reflections On The Debate There is a disturbing myth from ancient Greece. Aurora, the immortal goddess of the dawn, falls so deeply in love with a mortal man that she cannot accept losing him to death. She pleads successfully with the Olympian gods to grant him immortality, but forgets to request that he also be gifted with perpetual youth. Her human lover Is thus punished with the worst of fates- interminable life, daily made more intolerable by progressive aging and deterioration. Jonathan Swift illustrated the same chilling issue in Gulliver's Travels and also tragically in his own long, tortured, and undignified death from dementia.  Modern medicine has cursed an increasing percentage of our aging population to suffer this miserable fate- an artificially prolonged life preventing a natural and peaceful death. Medicine is, so far, much more advanced in keeping elderly people alive than in keeping them well. Our goal should be enhanced health, not a longer existence if that existence is painful and has lost all meaning. Medicine should help people live well, but also let them die peacefully and with dignity.  Tyler is much more optimistic than I that we will soon have the technical means to prolong youth and postpone death- and that we should use them. I am more accepting of the limits of life- eager to improve its quality, rather than expecting to extend its duration. Tyler trusts scientists to make scientific decisions. I believe that scientists have conflicts of interest that make them uniquely unqualified to judge the ethical implications of the scientific opportunities open to them. If scientists can do something, they will do it- fairly heedless of unintended consequences. Tyler has the optimism and enthusiasm of the young. I have the pessimism and caution of the old.  In a final flourish, Tyler trumped my argument that aging and death are somehow natural to the evolutionary scheme of things with the paradox that evolution has also given us the power to control aging and death and that surely we are programed to use it. He is probably right. I don't think our debate will be settled on ethical or theoretical grounds. History provides precious few examples of a society voluntarily rejecting the application of a powerful new technology- e.g., China burning its navy in the fifteenth century; Japan banning guns in the seventeenth. But both were closed societies whose conservative decisions were governed by internal political concerns; they were much less responsive than ours to economic and scientific competition and pressure.  My guess is that scientists will be given the freedom and the funding to follow every possible path to the fountain of youth and to doubling the lifespan. If they succeed, some chosen few of humanity will enjoy great benefits, while the masses may suffer even more than they do today and our environment may decay even faster than it already has. But I find aesthetic comfort in the firm belief that the scientists won't be able to deliver on their extravagant promises. Although our knowledge base is increasing exponentially, the more we learn about the body, the more we appreciate how difficult it is to translate basic science into clinical application. Our bodies are remarkably complex and carefully balanced machines. Scientists can tinker with them, but I suspect that the basic cycle of life and death will be very hard to change.

"Once it became clear Tuesday night that Don Blankenship would not be a Republican nominee for U.S. Senate, a jubilant Betty Harrah logged onto Facebook to show her gratitude to her fellow West Virginians. “For the first time in 8 years I feel like dancing,” Harrah wrote. “Thanks everyone that did not vote for a certain person.” Harrah has been living the last eight years with the Upper Big Branch mining disaster weighing on her. Her brother, Steven Harrah, along with 28 other men,  died in the 2010 catastrophe in Montcoal, West Virginia. A series of investigations found that the disaster could have been prevented had the mine’s owner, Massey Energy, not routinely skirted safety regulations and put profits before miners’ lives. The credible Senate run made by Blankenship, Massey’s unrepentant former chief executive, has made the Upper Big Branch tragedy feel like yesterday to Harrah and other families who lost loved ones. But his third-place finish behind Rep. Evan Jenkins and victor Patrick Morrisey in Tuesday’s primary restored their faith in their fellow voters, knowing that a candidate who served a year in prison on a conspiracy conviction was rejected. “It was relief,” Harrah said Wednesday morning. “Just to know we don’t have to look at him anymore.”   Despite investigators’ findings, Blankenship has never taken responsibility for what happened at Upper Big Branch. Instead, he has propagated conspiracy theories, blaming the government for his workers’ deaths and his prosecution, and claimed the explosion was the result of an influx of natural gas in the mine. Investigators found the explosion’s central cause was excessive coal dust that Massey failed to keep in check. Apparently not enough voters bought Blankenship’s claims about Upper Big Branch, or his insistence that he’d bring more jobs back to the state’s coal fields, to send him into a general election against Sen. Joe Manchin (D). Blankenship received 20 percent of the GOP primary vote, compared with Jenkins’ 29 percent and Morrisey’s 35 percent. To Tommy Davis, who worked at Upper Big Branch and survived the blast, Blankenship’s campaign was an insult he couldn’t escape, seeing him on television and hearing his voice over the radio in ads the millionaire paid for. The disaster took Davis’ son, Cory Davis; his brother, Timmy Davis; and his nephew, Joshua Napper. On Wednesday morning, Davis was looking forward to moving on.  “I’m feeling awesome,” he said.  In the weeks ahead of the primary, Davis was telling anyone who would listen not to vote for Blankenship, that the man put money before human life and should not represent West Virginia. Davis even confronted Blankenship at a Republican meet-and-greet, telling him he was to blame for the deaths at Upper Big Branch.  Nervous about Blankenship’s supposed surge late in the campaign, Davis spent Tuesday turkey hunting in the woods, trying to stay off the internet and away from the television until the final results came in.  “I think West Virginia sent him a message last night that he’s not wanted here,” Davis said. “Hopefully he’ll pack his stuff and go back to Las Vegas,” where Blankenship maintains his primary residence. “If not, I’ll keep hounding him,” David added. The Upper Big Branch disaster made Blankenship the face of greed and recklessness for many West Virginians. In 2016, he was convicted of one misdemeanor charge of conspiring to violate mine safety laws ― a charge not directly connected to the mining deaths ― leading to his one-year sentence at a federal prison in California. Republican leaders all the way up to President Donald Trump urged voters to reject the disgraced coal baron ― not because he led a company that systematically endangered workers, but because they felt he would be a weak candidate in a general election. Trump won West Virginia by a whopping 42-percentage-point margin in 2016, which makes the GOP hopeful it can snatch the Senate seat from Manchin with the right challenger. On the eve of the primary, Trump tried to remind his fellow Republicans of the cautionary tale of Roy Moore, the far-right candidate who won the Alabama GOP primary but later lost the general election after The Washington Post reported that he’d pursued sexual relationships with teenage girls. “Don Blankenship... can’t win the General Election in your State... No way!” Trump tweeted Monday. “Remember Alabama.”  Robert Atkins believes the president’s tweet influenced the primary. Atkins lost his son Jason at Upper Big Branch. During the campaign, he made a point of going to Blankenship’s events in order to speak directly to undecided voters and rebut Blankenship’s claims about what happened at the mine. When there were no campaign events, he went anywhere there were crowds ― like local baseball games ― to urge people to vote against Blankenship. Atkins said he was happy to see the primary results, though he doesn’t believe Blankenship will quietly go away, even after a decisive loss. West Virginia election law has a “sore loser” provision that prevents someone who lost a primary from running as an independent in the general election. Still, Blankenship could feasibly urge voters to cast write-in votes for him, or launch another bid in the next election cycle.  If the coal baron stays in politics, Atkins said he will continue speaking out. “As long as there’s a chance of his face being in the picture, I’m going to hurt him all I can hurt him,” Atkins said. “He wants to clear his name. He can’t live with having that burden on his shoulders, but he was responsible for what happened.” ",it,won,challenger

" Carri Schneider In 2008, Jessica Seinfeld released a cookbook for parents called ""Deceptively Delicious."" At the time, I was a newly-minted mother of a solid-food eating child. Seinfeld's book was all the rage among the other new mothers in my mama tribe. The recipes were ""stealthily packed with veggies hidden in them so kids don't even know!"" Yeah, I ordered a copy faster than a new parent can say ""Amazon Prime."" But one day, as I watched our young daughter polish off yet another bag of organic Just Peas, it occurred to me - the girl loved vegetables. LOVED them. I didn't need a cookbook to help me trick her into liking them. Instead of hiding chickpeas in the chocolate chip cookie batter or sneaking pureed squash in the mac & cheese, serving up the healthy stuff, then modeling and reinforcing just how good and healthy it was seemed to be the ""trick."" Seven years later, we have a second grader who has never met a fruit or vegetable she won't taste, picks Saag Paneer at Ambar to celebrate every birthday and packs salads for school lunch. I feel like maybe we did something right. Could a similar, intentional approach to learning have the same results? Instead of ""sneaking learning"" inside of educational games and activities, what if instead we had conversations with our kids about what piqued their curiosity, what they wanted to know more about, what they wanted to experience and how they could share what they had learned? Guided by those questions, ""The intentional weekend"" was born. Just like parents can teach their kids to lead healthy lifestyles by being intentional with them about how to make healthy choices, parents can also be intentional about modeling the importance of learning new things, having new experiences and challenging ourselves in new and meaningful ways. Here are 10 recommendations for being intentional about inspiring lifelong learners, based on experiences from our family. 1. Use a rainy or snowy day to learn something totally new together.  One snow day, my daughter and I tried ""Hour of Code"" and I was amazed at how much she learned about coding and how much I learned about her. 2. Launch an experiment that brings learning to life. An afternoon getting inspired by an online ""Stick Bomb Tutorial"" taught us more about kinetic energy than we could ever learn in a textbook. It was so cool that the kids insisted we make some videos and share them with their friends. We uploaded the videos to Instagram and Facebook and the kids were so excited to learn that they inspired other friends to build their own stick bombs at home! 3. Get out and explore. There's definitely benefit to roaming around the woods without an agenda, but that doesn't mean learning can't happen there too. Just last week a bike ride turned into some impromptu trail blazing through a community nature preserve. We pointed out signs of changing seasons, compared natural and man-made things along the trail, identified fungus on logs, talked about compost and more. That 20 minute hike yielded a solid week's worth of science lessons. 4. Take on personal challenges (and talk about overcoming them). We're intentional about discussing how brains learn and even our 4 year old can describe how challenging a brain to learn something new helps it ""grow."" We talk a lot about the importance of taking on mental and personal challenges, then spend time reflecting on how that experience felt and how it improved us. It's important that inspiration flows both ways. So, for example, I recently shared with our 7 year old that the way she really pushed herself to beat an end-of-season personal best in swimming butterfly inspired me to push myself to beat my personal best mile sprint time on the spinning bike. (See Eduardo Briceño's ""Growth Mindset Parenting"" for more on how to develop growth mindsets in children.) 5. Turn something passive into something active. Not every second of every day has to be tied to a specific learning goal, but there are times when parents can get creative in order to turn something passive into an active learning opportunity. Our youngest daughter is fascinated by toy review videos featuring other kids on YouTube. We'd rather her not spend too much time passively watching these videos, so instead I asked ""Wouldn't you rather learn how to make your own video?"" and voila! We encouraged the kids to set up their own set, make their own versions of the expensive toys on the YouTube channels and film their own reviews. Then we used imovie to make their own video and publish it online. 6. Seek answers together. We have a rule around here that questions get answered to the best of our ability. ""Just because"" and ""I don't know"" are off the table. Instead, if one of the kids has a question or one of us is curious about something, we'll find the answer together. This works well for a few reasons. It teaches kids to follow their intellectual curiosities and that their interests have value, while at the same time giving them real, authentic practice with research. Although the library can be a great way to spend an afternoon, not everything has to be a full research project. In our family, it's sometimes as simple as using google to find the origin of the phrase ""getting a Charlie horse"" or finding out all the ingredients in McDonald's Shamrock Shake. 7. Join (or start) a family book club. Since my oldest daughter was in Kindergarten, we've been in a monthly mother-daughter book club. Each month we rotate as the hosting family. We chose the book for everyone to read then lead the book talk, do a craft or activity, have a potluck dinner and spend time together. Our book club is focused on books that have strong female characters, but book clubs can be built around any theme or goal. One of my favorites was when we read ""The Evolution of Calpurnia Tate"" and, in the spirit of the main character, shared information about female scientists with our daughters and set up our own naturalist club for the afternoon - putting backyard discoveries under the microscope and adding them to our nature journals. 8. Cultivate an interest in the arts. Research supports the value in exposing children to the arts and doing so doesn't have to be expensive. We try to expose our kids to diverse experiences from bluegrass to ballet and from the contemporary art to the classics. Seek out opportunities for free community concerts and family nights at local museums. We've also been pleasantly surprised by the number of options on services like Amazon Streaming Video and Netflix to watch recorded videos of plays, concerts and shows like Cirque du Soleil. (See Mary Ryerse's ""Music Builds Maker Mindsets"" for more on the power of performing arts.) 9. Stop and smell the roses. Reflection is an important part of learning, so we try to create opportunities for our kids to slow down, practice mindfulness and reflect on the world around them. We like to collect treasures on our neighborhood walks and make nature mandalas when we get home. 10. Everything is an opportunity to learn. Parents, keep having fun with your kids and don't be afraid to tell them they're learning. Teach them learning is fun, motivating and rewarding. Go rock climbing and talk about pulleys. Set up a zipline and talk about gravity and friction. Spray boiling water out of your kitchen window during a polar vortex and talk about phase changes. Double a recipe. Pick berries. Write a letter. Walk across a frozen pond. Dig for worms. Find out how hot air balloons work. Go to the zoo. Plant an apple tree. Take a family art class. Climb a mountain. Build a birdhouse. Just keep learning.

"PHILADELPHIA ― Before he was the 2018 Super Bowl MVP and a civic hero, quarterback Nick Foles was a gentle, nurturing kid with white-blond hair and giant hands. That’s how I remember him, at least. Nick and I were childhood friends. His size always made him seem older and more imposing than he was. He was quiet and liked to play Nintendo. Our families spent holidays together and visited each other between Texas and Louisiana. Nick’s dad, Larry, had been the manager of a Baton Rouge restaurant where my dad bartended in the late ’70s. When Nick was 8, my dad took him and my brother duck hunting in Grand Chenier, Louisiana, and Nick was more interested in caring for the injured ducks in the blind after they’d been shot than in hunting them. At one point he got upset because some of the ducks seemed not quite dead. He wanted to end their suffering. So he tried to shoot one on the floor with his BB gun, but he missed, and the BB ricocheted and nailed my dad in the forehead. The Nick Foles who greeted me on Monday in a nondescript office at the Eagles’ Philadelphia training facility was not quite the Nick Foles I knew as a kid. I hadn’t seen him in 20 years. He is 6 feet, 6 inches now and in all ways a bona fide phenomenon. Grown colleagues of mine own shirts with his name on them. Men across Philadelphia have his face tattooed on their bodies. We spoke for an hour about football and fame and faith, about being an apolitical quarterback in a politically charged moment for the NFL, and about his near retirement two years ago and his unusual journey since then, from backup to star to backup again.  Nick! You’re so much bigger than the last time I saw you. I have a picture of you and my brother arm wrestling when you were children.  Eagles PR guy, on his way out of the room: I bet your brother can’t beat him in arm wrestling now. Nick: Taylor? He and I are getting older now, so we’d probably just have a beer and call it a day.  I thought you didn’t drink.  I’ll drink sometimes, usually hard dry cider. I’ve noticed, even though I’m 29, with all the hits and everything, my body just does not feel good when I drink alcohol. We have so much to do throughout the day, and when I’m healthier and on it, I can get more done and still be a dad and a husband. Do you have a vice? Do you ever just go nuts and eat a bag of Hot Cheetos?  I had two autograph signings the last two days for like eight hours, and I didn’t eat yesterday, so I got home and I was starving. And we eat gluten free ― my wife got real sick four years ago, so we’ve had to learn, and it helps me too with inflammation. But I got home and crushed a bag of chips. They were the healthiest chips you can get, made with coconut oil and stuff like that, but I’ll definitely have some gluten-free pizza.  So you don’t have a vice.  [Laughs]  What’s it like to suddenly be famous and see grown men around Philadelphia wearing shirts with your name on it and having tattoos of your face on their bodies?  It’s crazy because when I was here the first time around, we broke a lot of records, I got a lot of notoriety for that here. Philly just loves the Eagles. But when I came back after everything that happened in my career in St. Louis and being a backup in [Kansas City], I wasn’t as noticeable. I could go to the grocery store, and people would recognize me, but it wasn’t a big deal. Now I go anywhere in the nation and it’s a big deal.  Tori [his wife] and I were just in Hawaii on a pretty secluded island, and even there the locals knew who I was. A guy recognized me while I was snorkeling — it was crazy. People are always very nice. But I would never sit here and say you just get used to it — I don’t know if anyone’s ever supposed to be used to it.  What’s the weirdest fan encounter you’ve had?  The tattoo things are pretty crazy. I met a guy at a signing the other day — his whole back was me with a trophy on the “Rocky” steps.  Wow. Was it a good tat? What did you say? I mean, it was his whole back. Forever. There’s not much you can say. I was like, “That’s cool, man.” That’s there forever.  Do you find Eagles fans to be different than fans of other franchises?  Yes. The thing I’ve always admired about Eagles fans is that it’s not fans; it’s family. It’s generational. I was at a signing yesterday and a lady started crying. She said, “I got to watch the game with my 90-year-old mother, and it was the greatest moment of her life, watching the Super Bowl.” Another woman said she was trying to have kids and couldn’t get pregnant, and after the Super Bowl she got pregnant. The doctor said something shifted in her body that allowed her to be pregnant. Stuff like that you hear, and you realize this isn’t just a game for people here.  So there are people in Philadelphia that credit you with their fertility. This team. Yes.  I saw on Instagram that you have a “Rocky” trophy in your locker. Yeah, actually the guy who made the real “Rocky” statue [in Philadelphia] sent me that after the Super Bowl.  It’s funny that you saw that on Instagram. I’ve never been great at social media. With what Tori and I want to do, with helping the community and maybe starting a foundation, it’s important to expand that stuff. But I don’t want it to be a highlight reel of me, I want it to be real. My wife gets sick, Lily [his 10-month-old daughter] hit her head the other day — stuff goes on. Though beautiful pictures of beaches are wonderful, I want to post things that inspire me — whether it’s a song or something I read. I’m just trying to home in on using the platform to help people. Because football — though this is awesome, and it’s great to be in the NFL — I knew a long time ago this wasn’t where my heart would be. But now because of this, I can help a lot of people through other avenues. I can go and speak, and people want to see me. You’ve said that you want to be a youth pastor after the NFL, right?  The media sort of ran with that. People were like, “Oh, you want to be a pastor! God bless you!” When I was in Kansas City and having a tough time in my career, I decided to go to seminary to continue my spiritual growth. And the youth pastor thing — we have a great local church at home, and I always thought it would be cool to volunteer at the church. I could teach some sermons in the high school, but it’s more just to be one-on-one and help those kids at that point in their life.  There are so many people on your team from different backgrounds, different religions, different political views. Do you find yourself being a spiritual leader on the team or more kind of leaving everyone alone?  I think everyone knows I’m a Christian. But I just really want to show love to my teammates and show I genuinely care about them and that I’m not trying to be better than anyone. When I’m on a team, it’s all about relationships and just getting to know each other. If you ask me about [University of] Arizona, I probably won’t remember a lot of games, but I’ll remember the locker room. I’ll remember working hard with those guys and that friendship. The NFL’s a little different because guys are in and out all the time, but when I step in the building, I just want to get to know people. I’ll go in the equipment room and chat. When you actually love each other and you go into a game, it’s easier to play. When adversity hits, like in the fourth quarter and stuff goes bad, no one freaks out because you’re like, eh, I got it. We all care for each other. We know we can play. Every team says they’re like family, but this team really is more than any other that I’ve seen. That’s why I believe we won the Super Bowl — because of the relationships in the locker room. That’s the coolest part of the game. The number one thing I tell kids when I go speak is, if you’re doing this for money, fame, girls, boys, cars, whatever, you’re going to be very empty at the end of it. I can tell you that because I’m who you want to be if you want to be an athlete. I’m a professional athlete. And there’s nothing in there. The newest car’s not going to be good enough. For me it’s my relationship with Christ and my family, that’s what it’s all about.    Do you and your teammates joke around and make fun of each other? Do they have any nicknames for you?   Everyone knows I’m sort of goofy. Some guys are really serious when they play. I’m not. In practice, when I’m throwing with receivers, I’ll work on some no-look throws — I’ll look left and throw right. No one will ever do that in a game, but to me it’s just sort of fun, and there might be a day I do do it and everyone’s like, “HOW DID YOU DO THAT?” It’s just off-the-wall stuff. We played ultimate frisbee the other day, and I got to be a kid and run around like crazy. Even in games, I try to keep things humorous. If I throw a really bad ball or a long out-of-bounds ball, I’ll say: “Oh wow, that was really good, Nick. Wow.” But I won’t be down on myself, I’ll sort of laugh. An example is, during the Super Bowl I threw a touchdown to Corey Clement, our running back, that was between three defenders, and everything happened so fast. But I went through my reads, and I went to throw to Corey and in my head was like, This looks horrible. This is not how we drew it up. I’m not throwing it. What do I do? And all of a sudden the safety slipped a little bit, a tiny bit, and I was like, Oh I got this. And I threw it, but that’s what went through my head in a split second. And it landed between three guys and he caught it.  I have to touch on Colin Kaepernick and The New York Times story about the owners’ meeting, the talk about going to the White House or not going to the White House. There’s obviously a super politically charged environment in the NFL right now. Some of your teammates have been pretty outspoken about politics, but you’ve stayed out of the fray. Do you think it’s possible to remain apolitical as a star quarterback in the NFL?  I just don’t know a lot about politics, it’s something that I just don’t have a great knowledge in, so I just listen and observe. That’s really it. If I spoke about it, I wouldn’t have a lot of knowledge in it. The character of people, the heart of people, that’s where my focus is. When it comes to political issues, I look at things differently. It’s not necessarily for me to speak. I might have opinions, but I like to listen in those situations, because a lot of times you can say something, but you’re not going to be right either way. So it’s pointless. So you’re staying out of it.  [Laughs] So far.  How do you go from Super Bowl MVP to being a backup again? How do you flip that switch emotionally?  Well, it’s never been done, ever in the NFL, for a Super Bowl MVP to be a backup quarterback. I thought I might have been traded a month ago, because I saw everything in the news, and we’re aware of that because that’s our life. We just moved into a great home here last off season, we have a ten-and-a-half month old, a great place. And if you’re going to be traded, you have to be on your toes. But now that we restructured our deal, and we’re here for at least another year, it’s honestly a great opportunity to impact a lot of people, because a lot of people are gonna look at me and say, “Alright, let’s see how he really responds. Let’s see how he really acts. Let’s see who he really is.” And pride does seep in, you know. You see a Super Bowl ad and you’re like, wow, that’s crazy! And you’d love the opportunity to start. But you have to reel back in. I think everyone deals with that in some sort of fashion. You know, it’s humbling. I have to humble myself daily to come in here and be a backup quarterback, sit in meetings, and I’m not the starter, though two months ago we were on stage holding the Lombardi Trophy. But it’s good for me. I’m learning a lot about myself and growing in ways I never could imagine. Everyone else looks at it like, “Oh, you should be starting, you should be getting paid this,” and it gets in your head a little bit, and then you have to get it out. Because it doesn’t matter. You really have to just focus on now and just being grateful. It goes back to perspective, like my family — seeing my daughter and my wife. We’re happy. We have great people here. Just sort of enjoying the moment, because eventually football will be over.  What was it like going up against Tom Brady after having been a backup in the same season? How did you not crack under the pressure? Were you nervous?  I didn’t know how my body was going to respond, because it’s such a big stage. You know how you’re going to prepare, but you never know until you step on that field how it’s going to happen. Because you always prepare to succeed, but guys have bad games. My focus was staying in the moment, staying present. It’s easy to look at the big picture and freak out, but we say, “Be where your feet are.” Like right now, I’m present, I’m talking to you. That’s where I am. My mind isn’t wandering. And with that it sort of clears the clutter in your mind. Every day I get up, make coffee, read scripture. I was journaling every day during that time, because there were so many emotions I was dealing with, for leaving the team and being in that situation.  So I felt good going into the game, but I remember sitting there for the national anthem, and I was taking everything in. And I knew the first play of the game was a pass, and on that play I’d sort of get an idea of how my body’s doing, how my heart’s doing, how my mind — like, is everything calm? Then I dropped back, our first read was covered and did a hard reset all the way across the field and threw it to Nelson Agholor for a completion, and I remember right then I thought, I feel really really good. It was probably the most relaxed I’ve ever played in a game, was in the Super Bowl, because I was just very present. The stage didn’t get too big. And I really believe the reason I was so calm is because I have great teammates and that they’re very talented and work hard and do what they’re supposed to do. Not once this year did the offense get mad when the defense played bad, or the defense get mad when the offense played bad. That showed our team we always had each other’s backs. Is that different from other teams you’ve been on?  Yeah. I’ve been on teams, I don’t want to name them, but the attention to detail wasn’t great. Schematically, we weren’t great. Great guys, good people, but we didn’t have a strong identity, and going into the games was very stressful, very tough. And I remember having a lot of trouble — like I’ve always thrown for 300-400 yards a game since I was in high school, and it was this one year of my life playing the sport where we could barely get over 150 in a game, where I was used to throwing for that in a quarter. And it was very tough. But there’s a lot of growth that happened that year. I talk a lot to younger guys, and money can blind them. I mean, when you play, you should get paid for what you do. But make sure you go somewhere with a good system, good coaches. The grass isn’t always greener on the other side. It’s miserable if you get on a team and you aren’t playing well and everyone turns against each other. And I’ve experienced that. I thought I was going to retire two years ago. That was real. That was 100 percent. I was done. It is because you lost faith in yourself and thought you weren’t good anymore?  I knew I could still play ― they knew I could still play at an extremely high level. I just did not like football. I couldn’t touch a football. Someone would throw me a football, and I would just drop it. I’d had enough, I’d lost the joy. I can’t do something without my heart. I think something inside me was going on, there was so much fear to play again. It wasn’t that I didn’t think I could play, I just had a horrible experience and it just blinded me. But I knew there would be more growth in playing than in stepping away.  And I knew I brought so much joy to my dad and my father-in-law and my family and the people watching, and [the idea of taking that away from them] hurt. They’ll watch me play the game, and it provides so much happiness and escape. My dad has rewatched the Super Bowl probably a hundred times. My father-in-law just watched it again last night. That’s really sweet! My dad spent years trying to teach me how to throw a football correctly, giving me physics lectures about how my arm is like a whip. Are you going to do that to your daughter?  I’ll probably teach her how to throw a football. I really just want to do everything I can to love her and just be daddy. But I think she’ll have some good athletic genes — my wife is more athletic than me. She played volleyball at Arizona. She’s 5-foot-10, can run, jump. And Lily’s like, top percentile in length. She’ll just get a toy and throw it across the room. You want to see some pictures of her?",he,’s,me
"Olympian Aly Raisman addressed serial sexual abuser Larry Nassar in court Friday with a powerful statement, calling the former USA Gymnastics team doctor “pathetic” for complaining about the length of his sentencing hearing and “a monster” for abusing the trust of his young patients. “Larry, you do realize now that we, this group of women you so heartlessly abused over such a long period of time, are now a force and you are nothing,” Raisman said. “The tables have turned, Larry. We are here and we are not going anywhere.” Raisman joined more than 100 women who have shared victim impact statements during Nassar’s sentencing hearing in Lansing, Michigan, this week, two months after publicly identifying herself as one of the athletes he abused. Nassar, who faces a sentence of at least 25 years for sexual abuse, delivered a six-page letter to the court on Thursday, saying it had become too difficult for him “mentally” to continue to listen to his victims.  “This isn’t worth the paper it’s written on,” county Judge Rosemarie Aquilina responded. “There’s no truth in here. It’s delusional.”  Raisman referenced the letter in her statement. “You are pathetic to think any woman would have any sympathy for you,” she said. “You think this is hard for you? Imagine how any of us feels.” The star gymnast, who competed in the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, described how she felt “hearing a knock on the door” as “an innocent teenager in a foreign country” and finding Nassar. “You made me uncomfortable and I thought you were weird, but I felt guilty because you were a doctor,” Raisman said. She added: “I wouldn’t allow myself to believe the problem was you.” She said Nassar assured her that his touching, which she described as “inappropriate,” would be helpful, and that he “told on” young women who refused his treatment.  Nassar served as a team doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University until his firing in 2016. More than 140 women have accused him of sexual abuse. He pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct in November.  Raisman was joined on Friday by Jordyn Wieber, her teammate on the “Fierce Five” ― the name given to USA gymnasts at the 2012 Olympics. Other members of the Five, Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney, also have accused Nassar of abuse. Olympic gymnast Simone Biles has spoken out, too. Wieber’s statement was the first time she spoke publicly about Nassar. “I’m angry with myself for not recognizing the abuse and that’s something I’m struggling with today,” Wieber said. She explained how the doctor used “grooming techniques,” BuzzFeed noted, to make the young female athletes believe he was their friend.   pic.twitter.com/k2NSs6Dsam “I thought that training for the Olympics would be hardest thing I would ever have to do. But the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do is process that I am a victim of Larry Nassar,” Wieber said. Raisman has spoken out repeatedly about Nassar. In her statement, she again slammed the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics ― which she declared to be “rotting from the inside.” Both groups, she said, were “very quick to capitalize on my success,” while failing to take action against Nassar and issuing “empty” statements. “Talk is cheap,” Raisman said, calling for an independent investigation into how Nassar was allowed to continue working with young athletes over multiple decades.  Raisman asked the judge to sentence Nassar to the maximum to that he might have time “replaying the words delivered by this powerful army of survivors.” The hearing is expected to continue into next week to allow more women a chance to speak. ",Raisman,spoken,Nassar
"By Chris Hunt and Ishan Puri The Common Application has long been the hub for applications to U.S. colleges. Every year, more than half-a-million students seeking a place in the Ivy League and 600-plus other private and public colleges, log on to a portal that collects and distributes much of a student's application materials. The site is ground zero for the ""Common App Essay,"" a 650-word essay personal statement that can make or break a college application.  The high stakes are not lost on college-bound students. Anxious to write an essay that will lead admissions committees to say ""Admit,"" students struggle as they consider the five choices of prompts for their Common App essay. In this article, we propose a strategy for picking a prompt, a method that should relieve stress and lead to better essays. The Problem Anxiety about which prompt to choose is as old as the Common Application, which was conceived in 1975. Since then, students have spent countless hours wondering which prompt is the ""right"" prompt. Should I write about lessons from a failure or the transition from childhood? A challenge to a belief or a problem solved? An intellectual challenge? A cultural issue? Or maybe something that reveals the formation of my identity? What if I answer the wrong   	question?  The worrying is easy to understand. The odyssey of the college-bound student has already included navigating the rigors of high school, the pressure standardized tests, and the tyranny of personal and family expectations. The context makes it hard to blame a student for looking at the next step, the college essay, as more of a foe than a friend, or for fearing that the wrong choice might mean that years of work go down the drain. The Solution The quandary has a simple solution. Choose Prompt #1: ""Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story."" Put simply, the question offers students the opportunity to tell admissions committees absolutely anything that might enhance or complete the portrait painted by the rest of their application. This prompt gives students the room to tell the personal story of their choosing. The freedom to choose any story with personal meaning tends to inspire students to write essays in which they reflect on themselves. Think of Prompt #1 as an umbrella. Phrased to allow students to write anything that could complete an application, the question encompasses any of the other four prompts. In other words, if an application would be incomplete without the questions posed in the other prompts -- failures, transition to adulthood, challenged beliefs, and problems solved -- the student can use the specific prompt or the one that covers them all. Sidestep Pitalls Students who choose Prompt #1 also sidestep pitfalls. The other four prompts can get tricky, quickly, if a student does not have actually have a specific answer.  Take Prompt #5: ""Discuss an accomplishment or event, formal or informal, that marked your transition from childhood to adulthood within your culture, community, or family."" If the student does not have a life experience that ""fits"" the question, or is not able to convey a clear transition, the essay is likely to feel forced. Another pitfall can be seen in the context of Prompt #2: ""The lessons we take from failure can be fundamental to later success. Recount an incident or time when you experienced failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?"" Here, students might go down the path of simply explaining a failure and not reflecting on the personal impact of the  importance of the story.  The Solution Also Fits the Coalition Essays The first prompt on the Common Application also it fits the essay requirements of the Coalition Application. That application includes the essay prompt: ""Submit an essay on a topic of your choice."" Like Prompt #1 on the Common Application, this question is open-ended. Students may choose any topic.  Nor word limit an issue. The Coalition Application notes that ""most application readers find college essays are rarely improved when they are longer than 500 to 550 words."" And while the Coalition strongly recommends staying within that limit, there is no mandated maximum number of words. Admissions committees accustomed to reading 650-word Common App essays will likely be unfazed by a Coalition essay of the same length. Final Advice Student should try not to see college essays as a test. There is no right or wrong answer. The better view, one that aligns with the intentions of admissions committees, is to view the essay as an opportunity to go beyond test scores and GPAs, and paint a portrait of a living, breathing student. Choosing Prompt #1 will reduce the waste of time and energy a question. That energy can then be channeled to the task that matters, writing a college essay that shows admissions officers who you are and why you deserve a spot on their campus.

"By Dewey Cornell, University of Virginia for The Conversation Editor’s note: This article was adapted from testimony the author gave on March 20, 2018 at a school safety forum convened on Capitol Hill by U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) and House Democrats. The forum took place just hours after a student gunman was killed at Great Mills High School in Maryland after shooting and wounding two students there, one fatally. In the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, a wide variety of groups – from students to lawmakers – have been searching for ways to make U.S. schools and communities safer and prevent further shootings. One of the best ways to make schools safer is to use threat assessments – a tool developed by law enforcement to protect public figures. In my opinion as one who has studied youth violence for 34 years – and as a forensic psychologist who has worked with many violent youth, including several who have committed shootings at school – I believe the time has come to use threat assessments to protect the nation’s schools. The first thing to recognize is that violence in schools is just a small part of the larger problem of gun violence in American society. It would be a mistake, in my view, to focus only on schools and miss the bigger picture. Children are exposed to violence in many other settings in their communities. Over the past 20 years, the United States has experienced an average of 22 students murdered at school each year. However, outside of schools, an average of 1,480 students are murdered annually. In other words, students are 67 times more likely to be murdered outside of school than at school. There is understandable public alarm that there have been approximately 300 school shootings since the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012. However, according to CDC reports, there have been over 500,000 shootings outside of schools in those five years, or about 275 shootings every day, resulting in approximately 92 deaths and 183 injuries. From this perspective, U.S. schools are much safer than the surrounding community. The nation does not have a school violence problem but a gun violence problem. What I would point out here is that there is a credible body of scientific research that we can reduce gun violence with reasonable gun laws. The nation’s response to gun violence is often an emotional reaction of increasing security and preparing for the next shooting, rather than supporting efforts to prevent gun violence. It has been reported that schools spent US $5 billion in security measures after the Sandy Hook shooting. Even if schools spend $5 billion more and could somehow make every school impregnable, that would stop only a small fraction of the shootings. For every shooting in a school, there are more than 1,600 shootings outside of school. Why would it make sense to spend billions to stop one-tenth of 1 percent and ignore the 99.9 percent of gun violence? Prevention must start long before there is a gunman in the parking lot, and it requires, in my view, a three-tiered public health approach. The first tier is universal programs for everyone, such as improving school climate so that all children can succeed in school. Many of the mass shootings in schools and communities are committed by individuals who developed anger and resentment because of the bullying, harassment and discrimination they experienced at school. Schools should routinely measure and improve their school climate. On the second tier, prevention means helping troubled young people who are at risk before they start down the pathway toward violence. Put an armed guard in a school and you might prevent one shooting in one building. Put a counselor or psychologist in a school and you have the potential to prevent shootings in any building anywhere in your community. The third tier is to identify and intervene with students who are moving down a pathway toward violence, which brings me to threat assessment and how it works. Threat assessment is a safe and effective way to help students who have themselves threatened violence. It is a systematic process of evaluation and intervention for persons who have made verbal or behavioral threats of violence against others. Threat assessment was originally developed by law enforcement to protect public figures, such as the president of the United States and foreign leaders. It then expanded to business and is widely used by corporations to prevent workplace violence. Twenty years ago, the FBI and Secret Service recommended that threat assessment be used in schools. After participating in the FBI study of school shootings in 1999, I became intrigued by this idea. My colleagues and I worked with a group of educators to develop a threat assessment model for schools. Over the past 17 years we have refined our model, published a detailed manual, disseminated it to thousands of schools and conducted 11 studies of its effects. One of our key lessons learned is that threat assessment is a good prevention strategy, but that the particular situation of each school needs to be taken into account. The traditional law enforcement approach to threat assessment is focused on assassins and terrorists, but when it comes to schools, the focus is primarily on kids, who make threats frequently when they are angry, upset or just trying to gain some attention. In our first study, for example, we found that the age group that makes the most threats to kill are elementary school students. In almost all cases, students need counseling and discipline, not criminal charges. In school threat assessment, you must be careful not to overreact to student threats. The process must be calibrated to deal with kids, not adults. In four studies, we have found that fewer than 1 percent of students seen for a threat assessment carry out their threats. There have been fights, but none of the hundreds of threats to kill, shoot or seriously injure someone was carried out. Furthermore, three controlled studies found that schools using threat assessment had less student aggression, such as bullying and fighting, than schools that did not use threat assessment. My conclusion is that the rush to increase security measures should not overshadow measures that have been proven to prevent violence. In order to reduce gun violence in American communities and schools, policymakers and school leaders should adopt a threat assessment approach. This is a tool that, if properly adapted to the school setting, will not stigmatize or punish minor misbehavior but will allow schools to identify those students who are in need of mental health services and other support. And critically, in the small number of very serious threats, schools can recognize the danger, collaborate with law enforcement and keep schools safe.

"In September 2016, Rachael Denhollander was the first woman to go public with accusations of sexual abuse against former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University team doctor Larry Nassar. Since then, she has endured character assassinations from Nassar’s defense attorneys, a constant onslaught of victim-blaming, and the inevitable isolation of being the only woman to publicly accuse him for six months.  On Wednesday, she was the last of 169 survivors and family members to give her victim impact statement in court after a week-long sentencing hearing for Nassar. Her words were comprehensive, powerful and full of resilience.  “You started the tidal wave. You made all of this happen. You made all of these voices matter. Your sister survivors and I thank you,” Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said in response to Denhollander’s impact statement.  Nassar, who is accused of sexually abusing over 140 women, was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison on Wednesday afternoon on seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. He is already serving 60 years in prison on child pornography charges and awaits sentencing on three more counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. Denhollander’s statement is so all-encompassing, HuffPost decided her story should be read in her own words.  Below is her powerful statement in full, lightly edited for clarity. **** I do want to thank you, first, Judge Aquilina, for giving all of us the chance to reclaim our voices. Our voices were taken from us for so long, and I’m grateful beyond what I can express that you have given us the chance to restore them. There are two major purposes in our criminal justice system, Your Honor: the pursuit of justice and the protection of the innocent. Neither of these purposes can be met if anything less than the maximum available sentence under the plea agreement is imposed upon Larry for his crimes. Not because the federal sentence he will already serve is lacking, but because the sentence rendered today will send a message across this country, a message to every victim and a message to every perpetrator. I realize you have many factors to consider when you fashion your sentence, but I submit to you that the pre-eminent question in this case as you reach a decision about how best to satisfy the dual aims of this court is the same question that I asked Judge Neff to consider: How much is a little girl worth? How much is a young woman worth? Larry is a hardened and determined sexual predator. I know this first-hand. At age 15, when I suffered from chronic back pain, Larry sexually assaulted me repeatedly under the guise of medical treatment for nearly a year. He did this with my own mother in the room, carefully and perfectly obstructing her view so she would not know what he was doing. His ability to gain my trust and the trust of my parents, his grooming and carefully calculated brazen sexual assault, was the result of deliberate, premeditated, intentional and methodological patterns of abuse ― patterns that were rehearsed long before I walked through Larry’s exam room door and which continued to be perpetrated, I believe, on a daily basis for 16 more years, until I filed the police report. Larry’s the most dangerous type of abuser. One who is capable of manipulating his victims through coldly calculated grooming methodologies, presenting the most wholesome, caring external persona as a deliberate means to insure a steady stream of children to assault. And while Larry is unlikely to live past his federal sentence, he is not the only predator out there, and this sentence will send a message about how seriously abuse will be taken. So, I ask, how much is a little girl worth? How much priority should be placed on communicating that the fullest weight of the law will be used to protect another innocent child from the soul-shattering devastation that sexual assault brings? I submit to you that these children are worth everything. Worth every protection the law can offer. Worth the maximum sentence. The second aim of this court and our criminal justice system is to pursue justice for the victims that have already been harmed. And this aim too can only be realized by imposing the maximum sentence under the plea agreement, and in reaching this decision too, we also must answer the question, how much was a little girl worth? How much were these young women worth? This time, however, the little girls in question are not potential victims. They are real women and children, real women and little girls who have names and faces and souls. Real women and children whose abuse and suffering was enjoyed for sexual fulfillment by the defendant. I believe sometimes, your honor, that when we’re embroiled in a legal dispute, the words of our legal system designed to categorize and classify and instruct can inadvertently sterilize the harsh realities of what has taken place. They can serve as a shield against the horror of what we are really discussing. And this must not ever happen. Because the truth about what Larry has done must be realized to its fullest depth if justice is to ever be served. And so, for a moment, your honor, I, like every woman who’s come before you, want to take a moment to drop that shield. Larry meticulously groomed me for the purpose of exploiting me for his sexual gain. He penetrated me, he groped me, he fondled me. And then he whispered questions about how it felt. He engaged in degrading and humiliating sex acts without my consent or permission. And Larry enjoyed it. Larry sought out and took pleasure in little girls and women being sexually injured and violated because he liked it. And as I and so many other women and little girls were being violated, Larry found sexual satisfaction in our suffering. As we were being sexually violated even as very young children, as young as 6 years old, Larry was sexually aroused by our humiliation and our pain. He asked us how it felt because he wanted to know. What was done to myself and these other women and little girls, and the fact that our sexual violation was enjoyed by Larry, matters. It demands justice, and the sentence you impose today will send a message about how much these precious women and children are worth. You have seen our pictures, your honor ― moments in time captured when they were young and vulnerable and violated. I think of the young girl that I was and the little girls and young women all of these survivors were every day. I feel like I see them in the faces of my two precious daughters. When I watch my daughters’ eyes light up as they dance to “The Nutcracker,” I remember the little girl that I and all of these women used to be. The sparkle their eyes must have had, as mine did, before their innocence was taken. I watched my daughters love and trust unreservedly and I remember the long road that it has been to let myself love and be loved without fear. I think of the scars that still remain for all of us. One of the worst parts of this entire process was knowing, as I began to realize what had happened to me, how many other little girls had been left destroyed, too. I was barely 15 when Larry began to abuse me, and as I lay on the table each time and try to reconcile what was happening with the man Larry was held out to be, there were three things I was very sure of. First, it was clear to me this was something Larry did regularly. Second, because this was something Larry did regularly, it was impossible that at least some women and girls had not described what was going on to officials at MSU and USAG. I was confident of this. And third, I was confident that because people at MSU and USAG had to be aware of what Larry was doing and had not stopped him, there could surely be no question about the legitimacy of his treatment. This must be medical treatment. The problem must be me. And because I had friends who were physical therapists who practiced legitimate internal pelvic floor techniques, I also knew at 15 that to practice this, you must have specialized training and certification. Surely anyone who had heard that Larry was penetrating little girls would have demanded to know where he got his training, and if there was any question, he would’ve never been allowed near me. And so, I lay still and on the first two points, I was right. It was something he did often. And others had described Larry’s treatment before. In fact, though I didn’t know it at the time, four girls and women had described in detail to three different athletic departments at MSU what he was doing and his penetration and their belief that they had been sexually assaulted. It was reported to Kathie Klages, MSU’s head gymnastics coach, to a track coach and to multiple athletic trainers and supervisors years before I walked into Larry’s door. But I was wrong in my third belief. I was wrong that surely, if someone had been made aware of what Larry was doing, they would report it and ensure it was legitimate before ever allowing him near another child. I did not know when I was 15 that in 1997, three years before I walked into Larry’s exam room, that MSU’s head gymnastics coach, Kathie Klages, had waved a report form in front of Larissa Boyce after being told by two separate gymnasts of what Larry was doing and told Larissa there would be consequences for her if she reported.I did not know that Tiffany Thomas Lopez had reported the penetration and sexual assault to athletic trainer Destiny Teachnor-Hauk and to other athletic trainers and supervisors two years before I walked into Larry’s door. I did not know that Christie Achenbach had reported the penetration and sexual assault to her track coach and her athletic trainers and had also been silenced a full year before I walked into Larry’s door. I did not know that Jennifer Bedford had also reported to Destiny Teachnor-Hauk and asked if she could file a report that Larry’s treatment made her feel uncomfortable and that she had also been silenced. I believed the adults at MSU surrounding Larry would do the right thing if they were aware of what Larry was doing, and I was terribly wrong. And discovering that I could not only not trust my abuser but I could not trust the people surrounding him has been devastating. It is part of the consequences of sexual assault, and it needs to be taken seriously. I did not know that at the same time Larry was penetrating me, USAG was systematically burying reports of sexual assault against member coaches in a file cabinet instead of reporting them, creating a culture where predators like Larry and so many others in the organization, up to the highest-level coaches, were able to sexually abuse children, including our Olympians, without any fear of being caught. I did not know that, contrary to my belief, the elite gymnasts whose pictures were plastered on Larry’s wall were far from protected. That USAG, rather than supervising Larry, was allowing him to treat these girls in their own beds without even having a medical license in Texas. I did not know any of these things, and so as Larry was abusing me each time, I assured myself it must be fine because I thought I could trust the adults around me. My misplaced trust in my physician and my misplaced trust in the adults around me were wielded like a weapon, and it cost me dearly. And it follows me everywhere. I would like to take a moment now to address both organizations whose failures led to my sexual assault, because it is part of the consequences that I now carry. ... MSU, we have been telling our stories for more than 18 months, and you have yet to answer a single question I have asked. Every time I repeat these facts about the number of women who reported to employees at MSU and were silenced, you respond the exact same way. You issue a press statement saying there is no cover-up because no one who heard the reports of assaults believed that Larry was committing abuse. You play word games saying you didn’t know because no one believed. I know that. And the reason everyone who heard about Larry’s abuse did not believe it is because they did not listen. They did not listen in 1997 or 1998 or 1999 or 2000 or 2004 or 2014. No one knew, according to your definition of know, because no one handled the reports of abuse properly. Victims were silenced, intimidated, repeatedly told it was medical treatment and even forced to go back for continued sexual assault. You have stated in a motion to dismiss our civil suit that, ironically, is being heard right now in court as I am speaking, that the reports that were given in 97, ’98, ’99 and 2000 to track coaches, head gymnastic coaches and athletic trainers and supervisors don’t, quote, count as notice because these teenagers didn’t report it to the right official. The 14-year-old didn’t go to the right person. You have stated that no reports of sexual assault count as notice unless it is reported to a person who is capable of firing the alleged perpetrator. This entirely contradicts the letter that president Simon sent all 11,000 MSU employees in 2012, reminding them that MSU policy requires them to report any suspected child abuse and any allegations of sexual assault against someone at MSU. So, MSU, which is it? Do your employees have a duty to protect children or not? It has been 18 months, and I am still asking the same questions, hoping that the little girls that come after me will have adults that they can trust. And I’ve been getting the same answer for a year, and so I am asking point-blank again, when Kathie Klages humiliated Larissa Boyce and the second gymnast, greatly compounding the trauma of their sexual assault, and waved the report form in front of her telling her there would be consequences if she reported. Is this the right way or the wrong way to handle sexual assault allegations on MSU campus? When Tiffany Thomas Lopez reported her abuse to athletic trainers and supervisors and the trainers used the emotional pain Tiffany was in after her father’s death to convince her it would be too exhausting and painful to bother filing a report, was it the right way or the wrong way to handle a report of sexual assault on MSU campus? When Christie Achenbach reported the sexual assault to her track coach and athletic trainers and was also silenced, was it the right way or the wrong way to handle the report of sexual assault on MSU’s campus? When Kyle Stevens’ parents reported Larry’s sexual abuse of their daughter to a MSU psychiatrist and he brought Larry in to talk to her parents instead of reporting, as he was mandated to do by law, was it the right way or the wrong way to handle a report of sexual assault on MSU’s campus? When Amanda Thomas Shaw reported to the Title IX office, and Larry could hand-pick the four colleagues to be interviewed to determine whether his treatment was legitimate, was that the right way or the wrong way to investigate a claim of sexual assault on MSU’s campus? And after all this, when I came forward in 2016, I brought an entire file of evidence with me. I made a police report and a Title IX report, and I brought with me to those reports my medical records showing that Larry had never tried pelvic floor techniques. I brought medical records from a nurse practitioner documenting my graphic disclosure of abuse way back in 2004. I had my journals showing the mental anguish I had been in since the assault. A catalog of national and international medical articles showing what real pelvic floor treatment looks like. I brought a letter from a neighboring district attorney vouching for my character and truthfulness and urging detectives to take my case seriously. I brought a cover letter going point by point through Michigan law and case law, explaining how every element of first-degree criminal sexual assault was met and could be proven. I brought a witness I had disclosed it to in 2004. I brought evidence of two more women unconnected to me who were also claiming sexual assault. And I have the names of three pelvic floor experts willing to speak on my behalf. And the MSPD handled it beautifully, but MSU officials were a different story, because the response of Dean William Strampel was to send an email to Larry that day and tell him, quote, good luck, I am on your side. And when my video testimony to the IndyStar came out, graphically describing the abuse that Larry perpetrated, disclosing horrific details to the world that no one was ever supposed to know, that I had never told anyone, even my own husband, until that point, Dean Strampel forwarded that video testimony to the MSU provost, and he mocked it. He called it the cherry on the cake of his day. President Simon and board of trustees, is this the right way to handle disclosures of abuse on MSU’s campus? When Brooke Lemmen, one of the doctors Larry was allowed to hand-pick to clear himself in 2014, was interviewed for my investigation, she said I hadn’t really been penetrated ― I only thought I had, because, quote, when I am a 15-year-old girl, I think everything between my legs is my vagina. I only thought Larry had put his fingers in me for up to 40 minutes at a time for a full year. I was just confused. Sounds eerily familiar to what Amanda Thomas Shaw was told in 2014 that she, quote, didn’t understand the nuanced differences between sexual assault and a medical exam. It sounds eerily familiar to what every single woman was told all the way back to 1997. We were all wrong. We were all just confused. Board of trustees, is this the right way to handle disclosures of sexual assault on MSU’s campus? And if that were not bad enough, when I finally joined the civil suit five months later, after waiting for almost half a year for MSU to do the right thing, the vice president of the board of trustees, Joel Ferguson, went on television and gave a press interview in which he claimed those of us who have filed lawsuits were ambulance chasers who were looking for a payday. In fact, I know that at least one other high-ranking MSU official has specifically called me out by name and said I’m in it for the money. This has never been contradicted, retracted or refuted. MSU, you need to realize that you are greatly compounding the damage done to these abuse victims by the way you are responding. This, what it took to get here, what we had to go through for our voices to be heard because of the responses of the adults in authority, has greatly compounded the damage we suffer. And it matters. We have waited 18 months to be told no, this is not how we handle this on MSU’s campus. But instead, everyone has doubled down on the claim that nothing was done wrong and the only conclusion that can be reached is that no one truly sees anything wrong with any of this. And that is terrifying. And it leaves me terrified for the little girls of the future, who we are here to protect. And because of this willful ignorance, victim silencing and mishandling of sexual assault reports against Larry in ’97, ’98 and ’99, I walked through Larry’s door in 2000 and never walked out the same. Not long after I stopped seeing Larry, I transitioned from athlete to coach. And every day that I nurture those baby gymnasts, I wondered if any of them would find their way into his exam room. When one of my little girls was finally referred to him, I took a chance and I spoke up and I was kindly cautioned for my own sake to remain silent. My little baby gymnast was sent to Larry before I even knew a decision had been made to do so. Her family moved away almost immediately thereafter and I wept for that little girl and I prayed to God that she was under the age range that Larry preferred. She was 7. But when I filed my police report, Kyle Stevens came forward, and she was 6 ― a year younger than my little girl. And I cried in my kitchen, and I don’t know yet if that little girl walked out the same that she walked in. I transitioned from coaching to working in public policy, and I fought fear every time I had to commute or work close quarters with my male colleagues. I dreaded working on current event or legislation on sexual assault because I knew the memories that would come with it. I still watched gymnastics, but I looked away whenever the cameras panned to the sidelines in case Larry would be there. I wondered almost daily if there was ever a chance my voice would be heard. I began law school was I was 19. And I wrapped up in blankets every time I studied torts or crimes related to sexual assault and I hoped my face wouldn’t betray me in classroom discussions. I researched internal pelvic floor procedures and I tried to find out what had happened to me, and I watched for any sign that I would ever be believed.I met my future husband and I told him what I never wanted to tell anyone, and I wondered if he would walk away, and he didn’t. But I couldn’t even hold his hand or look up at him, because closeness wasn’t safe and trust wasn’t safe. We got married, and my 25th birthday came and went, and I sat up for nights before, believing my ability to file a police report would end on that birthday. I didn’t know the statute of limitations had been lifted. I woke up the morning I turned 25, and instead of feeling joy at a milestone, I only felt hopelessness and grief, because I thought my chance to stop this man was over. I thought daily about all the little women and girls walking in his office and I wondered if it would ever, ever end. I became a mother three times over, and the fear that hung over each birth, knowing I would be vulnerable in a medical setting, cast a horrific shadow over what should have been an occasion of pure joy. And I watched for a chance to be believed and I waited. I held my firstborn and then my two daughters, and each time I did, Larry, I remember the day you brought [your daughter] into your office so that I could hold her. You knew how much I loved children and you used your own daughter to manipulate me. And every time I held my babies, I prayed to God you would leave your abuse in the exam room and not take it home to the little girl born with black hair just like her daddy. And then the IndyStar story came out about the rampant cover-up at USAG, and I knew this was the chance and I wrote them immediately. But because of what Larry did, the cost of making it end has been incredibly high. And the effects of Larry’s abuse has been redoubled in the effort that I took to stop him. Choosing to live those moments over and over, daily, releasing every shred of privacy that I had, living with the reality that not only didn’t I get to choose what you did, but now I didn’t get to choose who knew about it. Even my status as a sexual assault victim has impacted or did impact my ability to advocate for sexual assault victims, because once it became known that I too had experienced sexual assault, people close to me used it as an excuse to brush off my concerns when I advocated for others who had been abused, saying I was just obsessed because of what I had gone through, that I was imposing my own experience upon other institutions who had massive failures and much worse. My advocacy for sexual assault victims, something I cherished, cost me my church and our closest friends three weeks before I filed my police report. I was left alone and isolated. And far worse, it was impacted because when I came out, my sexual assault was wielded like a weapon against me. Often by those who should have been the first to support and help, and I couldn’t even do what I loved best, which was to reach out to others. I was subjected to lies and attacks on my character, including very publicly by attorney Shannon Smith when I testified under oath. I was being attacked for wanting fame and attention, for making up a story to try to get money. Your Honor, since these attacks were made on my character very publicly on public record, I would like to take an opportunity briefly now to correct them. Out of the two women in question that day, Ms. Smith and I, who were attempting to communicate through either questions or answers, I would like to note that only one of us was taking pictures of the courtroom on her cell phone. Only one of us posed for the press and said, quote, I feel like I should say cheese. And out of the two of us, only one of us was making money off her court appearance that day. I don’t feel the need to say anything else. I think I’ve communicated completely. The cost, emotional and physical, to see this through has been greater than many would ever know. And Larry, I don’t need to tell you what the cost of your abuse has been to me, because you got to read my journals, every word of them. Because those had to go into evidence to make this happen.I want you to understand why I made this choice, knowing full well what it was going to cost to get here and with very little hope of ever succeeding. I did it because it was right. No matter the cost, it was right. And the farthest I can run from what you have become is to daily choose what is right instead of what I want. You have become a man ruled by selfish and perverted desires, a man defined by his daily choices repeatedly to feed that selfishness and perversion. You chose to pursue your wickedness no matter what it cost others, and the opposite of what you have done is for me to choose to love sacrificially, no matter what it costs me. In our early hearings, you brought your Bible into the courtroom and you have spoken of praying for forgiveness. And so it is on that basis that I appeal to you. If you have read the Bible you carry, you know the definition of sacrificial love portrayed is of God himself loving so sacrificially that he gave up everything to pay a penalty for the sin he did not commit. By his grace, I, too, choose to love this way. You spoke of praying for forgiveness. But Larry, if you have read the Bible you carry, you know forgiveness does not come from doing good things, as if good deeds can erase what you have done. It comes from repentance, which requires facing and acknowledging the truth about what you have done in all of its utter depravity and horror, without mitigation, without excuse, without acting as if good deeds can erase what you have seen in this courtroom today. If the Bible you carry says it is better for a stone to be thrown around your neck and you thrown into a lake than for you to make even one child stumble. And you have damaged hundreds. The Bible you speak carries a final judgment where all of God’s wrath and eternal terror is poured out on men like you. Should you ever reach the point of truly facing what you have done, the guilt will be crushing. And that is what makes the gospel of Christ so sweet. Because it extends grace and hope and mercy where none should be found. And it will be there for you. I pray you experience the soul crushing weight of guilt so you may someday experience true repentance and true forgiveness from God, which you need far more than forgiveness from me ― though I extend that to you as well. Throughout this process, I have clung to a quote by C.S. Lewis, where he says, my argument against God was that the universe seems so cruel and unjust. But how did I get this idea of just, unjust? A man does not call a line crooked unless he first has some idea of straight. What was I comparing the universe to when I called it unjust? Larry, I can call what you did evil and wicked because it was. And I know it was evil and wicked because the straight line exists. The straight line is not measured based on your perception or anyone else’s perception, and this means I can speak the truth about my abuse without minimization or mitigation. And I can call it evil because I know what goodness is. And this is why I pity you. Because when a person loses the ability to define good and evil, when they cannot define evil, they can no longer define and enjoy what is truly good. When a person can harm another human being, especially a child, without true guilt, they have lost the ability to truly love. Larry, you have shut yourself off from every truly beautiful and good thing in this world that could have and should have brought you joy and fulfillment, and I pity you for it. You could have had everything you pretended to be. Every woman who stood up here truly loved you as an innocent child, real genuine love for you, and it did not satisfy.I have experienced the soul satisfying joy of a marriage built on sacrificial love and safety and tenderness and care. I have experienced true intimacy in its deepest joys, and it is beautiful and sacred and glorious. And that is a joy you have cut yourself off from ever experiencing, and I pity you for it. I have been there for young gymnasts and helped them transform from awkward little girls to graceful, beautiful, confident athletes and taken joy in their success because I wanted what was best for them. And this is a joy you have cut yourself off from forever because your desire to help was nothing more than a facade for your desire to harm. I have lived the deep satisfaction of wrapping my small children up in my arms and making them feel safe and secure because I was safe, and this is a rich joy beyond what I can express, and you have cut yourself off from it, because you were not safe. And I pity you for that. In losing the ability to call evil what it is without mitigation, without minimization, you have lost the ability to define and enjoy love and goodness. You have fashioned for yourself a prison that is far, far worse than any I could ever put you in, and I pity you for that. And this is also why in many ways, your honor, the worst part of this process was each name, each number who came forward to the police with each Jane Doe, I saw my little girls and the little girls that were. The little girls who walked into Larry’s office that I could not save because no one wanted to listen. And while that is not my guilt, it is pain I still carry and pain I share with them. I cried for them, and with every tear that fell I wondered who is going to find these little girls, who is going to tell them how much they are worth, how valuable they are, how deserving of justice and protection? Who is going to tell these little girls that what was done to them matters? That they are seen and valued, that they are not alone and they are not unprotected? And I could not do that, but we are here now, and today that message can be sent with the sentence you hand down, you can communicate to all these little girls and to every predator to every little girl or young woman who is watching how much a little girl is worth. I am asking that we leave this courtroom ... knowing that when Larry was sexually aroused and gratified by our violation, when he enjoyed our suffering and took pleasure in our abuse, that it was evil and wrong. I ask that you hand down a sentence that tells us that what was done to us matters, that we are known, we are worth everything, worth the greatest protection the law can offer, the greatest measure of justice available. And to everyone who is watching, I ask that same question: How much is a little girl worth? Larry said in court that he hoped education and learning would happen from this tragedy, and I share that hope, and this is what we need to learn. Look around the courtroom, remember what you have witnessed these past seven days. This is what it looks like when someone chooses to put their selfish desires above the safety and love for those around them, and let it be a warning to us all and moving forward as a society. This is what it looks like when the adults in authority do not respond properly to disclosures of sexual assault. This is what it looks like when institutions create a culture where a predator can flourish unafraid and unabated, and this is what it looks like when people in authority refuse to listen, put friendships in front of the truth, fail to create or enforce proper policy and fail to hold enablers accountable. This is what it looks like. It looks like a courtroom full of survivors who carry deep wounds. Women and girls who have banded together to fight for themselves because no one else would do it. Women and girls who carry scars that will never fully heal but who have made the choice to place the guilt and shame on the only person to whom it belongs, the abuser. But may the horror expressed in this courtroom over the last seven days be motivation for anyone and everyone no matter the context to take responsibility if they have failed in protecting a child, to understand the incredible failures that led to this week and to do it better the next time. Judge Aquilina, I plead with you as you deliberate the sentence to give Larry, send a message that these victims are worth everything. In order to meet both the goals of this court. I plead with you to impose the maximum sentence under the plea agreement because everything is what these survivors are worth. Thank you. Need help?

"Ask ten American poets if poetry is dead, and seven will say it’s not, one will say it is, and two will contort themselves gymnastically trying to prove to you that the fact that poetry is dead is somehow a boon to the art-form. Ask ten non-poets living in America if poetry is dead, and it’s a clean sweep: ten of ten will tell you it’s deader than Stephen Miller’s bedroom eyes. This article is for all twenty people—as well as those who, on principle, don’t answer questionnaires. It’s for poets because contemporary American poetry has, since the early 1970s, routinized being a national disappointment. Barely a fraction of the energies endemic to poetry-as-art are now being harnessed by (we) contemporary poets, and it’d be high time for an end to that even were it not the case that poets are more or less the only people who read poetry regularly. American poetry has become a niche culture—like the ones available for players of Magic the Gathering, or self-described “Bronies,” or advocates of “furry” sex—and not the vibrant performance of endlessly differentiated artistic perspectives it should be. This means that decisions about how to write poetry are being made, both implicitly and explicitly, with an eye toward what a very narrow subculture of artists demands and will reward. The result is a betrayal of the very capacity for historic, system-challenging idiosyncrasy that makes poetry worth composing in the first place. For every game-changing book of poetry by a poet like Claudia Rankine, there are three hundred that join the freeway of American poetry publishing as indistinguishably as a Camry or Civic does I-90 in Sioux Falls. All that said, there’s little point in writing an article about the death of poetry that’s explicitly aimed at working poets because American poetry today is—besides terminally wounded—a death-cult. In installing the rigid subcultural economy so many of them frequent, American poets have entered a suicide pact that ensures their own perpetual unhappiness as well as the demise of poetry as a relevant public gesture. Indeed, in my experience so committed are poets to the rituals of their aging cult that any challenge whatsoever to its key mantras is taken as an act of betrayal—one punishable by violent expulsion from the group. In my case, that’s okay, even fortuitous; I was a member in reasonably good standing within the cult for a number of years, and I’ve largely left it now. But I’ve also found that one of the only honorable gestures one can make when one has escaped a cult that eats lives and devours the very principles it claims to elevate is to expose it for what it is as often and as publicly as one can. And since every missive filled with cult-rage sent in response to that sort of extroverted self-exorcising has already been written in my head innumerable times, there’s no reason now (detractors, please take note) to hand me the hard copy of same or “cc” me on a digital reduction. This article is therefore more vigorously intended for the non-poet because you, more than anyone, have been lied to about what poetry is—which you couldn’t have known because the people most loudly denouncing any definition for “poetry” alternative to the false one were either (a) self-avowed “poets” themselves, and thereby capable of “pulling rank” on you, or (b) educators so thoroughly tortured over the years of their own education into a false consciousness about poetry that the very least they could do was honor that generation-spanning cycle of violence by perpetuating it.  So let’s be clear: the poetry most non-poets are likely to have been exposed to in high school or college or anywhere else is to the maximum capacity of the poetic act in 2017 what the Wiggles are to the entertainment of small children.  The poetry you’ve read, that is, is either (a) poetry that was dangerously revolutionary at the time well in the past it was written, but is now presented to you as an aesthetic rather than political achievement in order to ensure it remains as alien to your contemporary aesthetic sensibilities as possible, or (b) whatever contemporary poetry was able to get through a complex subcultural system exquisitely designed to keep you permanently uninterested in poetry. So the fact is that most non-poets hate poetry about the same way I hate bluegrass: I haven’t really heard any of it, and I didn’t like what little I heard, and I didn’t give much thought at all to what I did hear, so I’ve decided not to hear any more—which seems reasonable given that there are so many things to do in life. That attitude toward poetry worked just fine during the Johnson administration—about the last time poetry could claim broader cultural relevance, due to the sometimes explosive work of the Beats, the Black Arts Movement, the San Francisco Renaissance, and the poets of the New York School—but as a nation we badly missed the vibrant poetry scene we desperately needed during the horrors of Vietnam’s final years, the Nixon resignation, the rise of the “Me Generation” under Reagan, and the thoroughly immersive horror-show of a fake hunt for WMDs in the aughts and a tinpot dictator arising from American soil in the present. Look in desperation for a Pussy Riot in poetry, or a Marina Abramović, or a Robert Mapplethorpe, or a Lenny Bruce, or even as congenial a rebel as a David Foster Wallace, and you’ll come up empty. That’s in part because you’re asking the wrong questions and looking in the wrong places for such poets and poetry—and in part because 100,000 working American poets (the largest committed poetry-writing population of any nation on earth) are doing their level best to keep you looking their way rather than any other.  (They’re failing, of course, inasmuch as, if you’re like most Americans, you’re not reading any poetry at all.) So below are ten ideas that could save American poetry. The list is obviously non-exhaustive, and these ideas do not comprise a prescription for poetry-writing. It’s consistent with American poetry’s radical birth in the First Amendment that every poet should write however they damn well please, and that different people come to poetry for very different things. What these ideas are, however, is a confession, by a longtime poet, that while not many poets need to be integrating these ideas into their poetry-writing practice, and not many non-poets need to re-dedicate themselves to reading poetry and poets undergirded by the principles below, at least some do if poetry is going to survive much further into the digital age. In short, America, poetry needs you in a much more obvious way than you need poetry. Fortunately, the poetry that needs you the most, and which, in turn, non-poets most need whether they realize it or not, is not the poetry that many poets are now writing or the poetry that non-poets are currently not reading. Instead, it’s an entirely different and in certain respects particularly American beast that deserves your attention as much now as the Ramones did in the 1970s. And it’s just about as good for you. NOTE: Every video in this article is poetry. Note also that while some of these ideas are ones I’ve developed, others have been in development for a very long while by a great many people who are not me. The point is not that a person—me or anyone else—can individually do anything to rescue poetry from a poetry subculture that daily celebrates falseness, cruelness, smallness, and exclusion, but that the same subculture that is now systematically strangling poetic innovation on occasion produces the tools of its own dismantling. If there is a good thing to be said about contemporary American poetry, it is that it is not yet so disconnected from its own distress that it cannot provide clues to those on the lookout for a course correction. So here’s a start in that direction, at least: 1. Poetry is not a genre of art. What poetry is is a “meta-genre,” meaning that it’s a concept you find—and already enjoy—in innumerable genres of art you love and regularly consume. The most succinct definition of poetry I’ve come across holds that a poem is a “reflexive language system,” which means, taking those three words in reverse order, that it’s (a) a phenomenon that exhibits signs of a formal structure, (b) expressed in any mode of communication that qualifies as a “language” (including oral, written, visual, nonverbal, experiential, multimedia, transmedia, augmented-virtuality, augmented-reality, and virtual-reality modes of communication), which also (c) shows signs of self-awareness that it is (i) communicative and (ii) has form.  Still shorter: any form of communication self-consciously informed by a philosophy of communication (what we call a “poetics”) can be poetry.  Shortest: poetry is an idiosyncratic literacy operating on a common language. What this means is that any comedian worth remembering after they’re dead—Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, Richard Pryor, or Robin Williams, for instance—was probably using the meta-genre we know as “poetry” to create an unforgettable series of performances whose attitude toward language was complex, internally coherent, and worthy of long-term recall and study. The same is true of every musician who pioneers a genre, whether it’s Gil Scott-Heron and rap, The Monks and punk, Roky Erickson and psychedelia, or diverse trailblazing figures from John Cage to Joanna Newsom, Charlie Parker to Sturgill Simpson.  Simple fact: if you’re artist and you don’t have a “poetics”—an idiosyncratic philosophy, arising from the sum of your interests and knowledge and experience, about the purpose of communication—your work won’t just be forgotten when you die but will be forgotten while you’re still alive. 2. Don’t feel obligated to connect with any poetry that’s not as meaningful to you as your favorite music, comedy, cinema, or visual art is. Somewhere along the way poetry got separated out from all the other art-forms in a very particular way: it became all right to say “I like poetry” or “I don’t like poetry”—everyone would know what you meant—when you’d sound ridiculous if you were to say, “I don’t like any music” or “I don’t like any movies” or “I never laugh at comedians.”  The truth is, when it comes to art we all like about 5% of what’s out there. If you could sit down and hear every band that ever cut a track, or watch every film ever made, or listen to every stand-up comedian who ever booked a gig in a two-bit basement bar, you’d have no interest in 95% of it and find the rest thoroughly engaging.  Poetry is the same way, inasmuch as I can tell you now that, whoever you are, at least 95% of poetry isn’t for you and shouldn’t be. And your dislike of it no more means you “don’t like poetry” than disliking Garth Brooks means you don’t like any music. But all that said, I bet I could find some poetry you dig. The key difference between music and cinema and stand-up comedy—art-forms which increasingly are not “managed,” meaning you can access the full range of performances they have to offer with little or no difficulty—is that poetry is beholden to a system that distributes a narrow band of the art-form to American audiences. Our high schools, our colleges, and even many of our local reading series are a devious form of “managed care” inasmuch as they take care of poetry’s legacy by imposing atop it a massive, labyrinthine subcultural bureaucracy under whose ministrations the patient has died unnecessarily.  The upshot: hold poetry to the same standard you do any other art-form, but also militate, alongside me and many others, for poetry to unlock its doors so that you can experience its range (and so its poets can be encouraged to produce and expand that range) in the same way every other American art-form now permits. 3. Poets are charged more than any other type of artist with torching language and all its conventions. There’s a reason that, throughout history, poets have been among the first targeted for death in every autocratic power-grab, though you’ll find almost no evidence of that history in the interviews American poets give about poetry. If you’ve ever read or listened to an interview with an American poet—and you probably haven’t; even most poets haven’t when they say they have—you’ll hear a lot of saccharine talk about how poetry either (a) preserves language and memory and the sensory elements of communication beneath a beautiful bell jar (perhaps like the one in Disney’s Beauty and the Beast), or (b) uses language in some other esoteric way certain to have a dramatic impact on the life and sensibilities of no one but the poet.  Along with either one of these two lines of reasoning you’ll hear a lot of wild claims about the power of poetry that no poem you’ve ever read has substantiated. You will suspect, rightly, that what many poets see in poetry is simply a mirror-image of what they need from poetry—psychologically, emotionally, and/or socially—not what poetry is likely to be to anyone else who does not harbor those specific needs. But there are poets out there who take a different view, who say that having a “poetics” means trying to create either an entirely new System of the World or firebomb (metaphorically) the existing one with the same manic energy you’d find at a death-metal concert.  The first exertions of an autocratic or revolutionary cultural pulse are always felt in language, and as any poet’s core milieu is language—sometimes accompanied by music, sometimes by the moving images of a film, sometimes performed on a stage with comic timing—a poet’s most profound palette is always power itself. The poet contests the world with language; while it’s equally true that the poet constructs new worlds with language, for too long in American poetry the contestations found in poems have been excessively coded ones and the constructions it enables about as private as Trump’s Mar-a-Lago.  My point is that as and when you find yourself looking for examples of humans using language to decimate the chains that bind them, you are in search of poetry. And when you find the reflexive language system you’re looking for—the human communication that knows exactly how and why and where it must exist—you may find it in music, in a political speech, in the cinema, or anywhere else fellow homo sapiens are battling death and eternity. 4. Poetry is more forgiving of “error” and more celebratory toward what makes you a weirdo than anything else because it’s worthless. Music, stand-up comedy, cinema, political speech-making—all have boundaries and standards of “taste” applied to them because all are commercially viable. For the “badness” of a film, say, to be celebrated, the badness must not just be extraordinary but something to be held up to the smugness of our collective scorn—as is the case with Tommy Wiseau’s The Room.  Music does a bit better—the reflexive disposability of glam-rock (a poetics) and the celebration of amateur musicianship we sometimes find in punk (also a poetics) acknowledge “badness” as a necessary component of communication—but then we find, in political speech-making, that there is a right way and a wrong way to do it, and the wrong way is near-universally derided. (This is one reason why, for all that nearly every aspect of his character and his political agenda is odious, Donald Trump should be celebrated by those with the hearts of poets for just one thing: his ability to subvert the mechanics of political speech-making. Trump, out of folly rather than genius, has reshaped, for instance, at what grade-level a political speech can be written, how often a word—particularly an empty platitude or verbal tic—can be repeated, and what sort of body language or voice inflection is eligible for the adjective “presidential.” We might not like the result, but we can still agree that there should be more ways to rouse a crowd in American politics than just the one. Incidentally, Bernie Sanders also found a new language in which to encode a politics, which is why he too struck an unlikely chord this last election season).  Note that in calling a poem a “reflexive language system” we do not say it has to be marketable, that it has to please many people, or even that it need be pleasing in its form, mode of communication, or concept—merely that it have a form, a communicative capability, and a concept. A poem that makes you enraged, that makes you laugh, that befuddles you, that leaves you markedly cold, or that makes you join a political revolution like the one now forming in opposition to Donald Trump is no less a poem because it doesn’t offer slick production values or doesn’t appeal to your personal tastes. Poems can revel in sloppiness, in “badness,” in their schlocky fidelity to how we actually live, think, speak, feel, fear, love, and see. The idea that poetry must be an elevation of language above the mire of existence is a falsehood perpetuated by literary propagandists. But part of this idea—the idea that poetry’s dodgy economics are a benefit to it, not a hindrance—is the idea that poets have to start fighting more vigorously for this ethos to invade poetry produced in the academy as well.  Since 1993, creative writing has grown faster in terms of terminal-degree program creation than any other discipline, but we don’t see the markers of that success in such programs’ funding packages. Too many young poets are kept from accessing the time and space to write that a writing program offers by an inability to afford the bill. And it is an actual evil—I use that word, evil, advisedly—that many of the powers that be in American poetry have worked so hard to ensure that graduate creative writing programs will never become the fully funded terminal-degree programs they should be. So treating the economics of poetry as a surprising asset for the art-form also means eliminating any barriers to that maxim being universal rather than just local.  In America today we have an opportunity for our creative writing MFA programs to be fully funded in the same way terminal-degree programs in all other academic disciplines are, and to the extent certain poets stand in the way of that progress they should be swept aside as enemies of not just art but the real lives of real people. (Note that I don’t include in this rhetoric those who work in programs that are not fully funded and are doing their level best to change the economic superstructure of their writing program.) The same can be said of any poet—and there are many today in this group, including many atop poetry’s subcultural hierarchy—who consider themselves entitled to decide who should or should not be writing poetry or what a poet can or cannot write. Poetry, however idiosyncratically defined and located, should be everyone’s pursuit, and to narrow the path toward it, whatever one’s self-righteous reasons for doing so, is as much an actual evil as is putting it out of reach of the poor. Poetry must be ever mindful, in particular, of opening its doors still wider to the shy, the Middle American, and the suffering—whether those suffering persons are straight and white and male or members of a minority population. 5. A poet knows better than anyone that words are just words. A poet can celebrate how much a single word is worth—can show us how just three words (say liberty, equality, and fraternity, or we the people) can move an entire nation to action—but knows too what comedians have long known, which is that language is endlessly malleable, fungible, ephemeral, and combinatory.  A poet can treat words like a jazz musician treats notes—as an opportunity for improvisation (a comment on form which is, of course, its own formal structure)—or like Girl Talk treats samples. That’s right: literary remixing is a thing, and is poetry. You can remix other people’s poems, or your own Facebook feed, or someone else’s Facebook feed, or the words on the back of a cereal box. You can also appropriate—or misappropriate—language as part of a poetics, such as turning a Donald Trump speech into poetry or falsely attributing a series of lyric monologues to a dead person. You can explode linguistic taboos and expose their innards. You can loop an unscripted Chat Roulette session into the middle of a poem that performs the experience of reading the internet, as I once saw the poet Jesse Damiani do at a reading in Oxford, Mississippi, or turn the Nirvana album Nevermind into an epic book of poetry with one line of Cobain’s lyrics per page, as has also been done recently.  You can do whatever the hell you want in/as poetry, provided it is done reflexively—that is, mindfully, and with consideration of form and concept—and provided it generates something more than a private (i.e., non-communicative) language system. Words are material, and so they act, and can be acted upon, just like any other material: they can break, explode, recombine, be poorly made, be dropped into the same space over and over, and so on. They can also generatively displease us, moving us to action or new philosophies by dint of their provocations. 6. Poetry is not just the best but perhaps the only way to authentically “perform” your life. I said poetry is a meta-genre, and it is, but of course this also means that, when we find it, we can identify its operations independent of any accompaniment. Miles Davis could make poetry with a trumpet, and Jimi Hendrix with a guitar, and Robert Mapplethorpe with a camera, but while we always carry our ability to make words with us, we do not always have a trumpet, guitar, or camera at hand.   Poetry, in other words, doesn’t come from the trumpet, or the guitar, or the camera, but from a series of competencies and knowledge bases that (say) Davis, Hendrix, and Mapplethorpe had been deriving all their lives from their experiences and their psyches. Poets ought to stop advertising poetry as an instrument for constructing something entirely different from the world we all live in, when what most of us need or would ever want to come to art for is to perform our lives as we live them. That is, in our words, our ideas, the sounds of our life, and the spaces in which we move.  Davis’ plan for performing “So What” (see above), or Moondog’s relationship with the constituent sounds that make up his slice-of-life self-titled album (see below), would be where the poetry is even if neither Davis nor Moondog had ever cut an album. In my own life, I find that much of what I say and do is built upon the invisible foundation of what the people I care about and admire have said and done to me in the past, so I sometimes write poems in which I combine my language with the language of those other people without distinguishing between what I “wrote” and what others have said. Why? Because what I am—all I am—is a superficially seamless combination of those two categories of language, and so I use poetry to perform that fact.  In music, it takes John Cage’s extraordinary composition 4’33”—which is just four minutes and thirty-three seconds of silence, forcing the listener to hear the sounds of her own life (e.g., breathing, others’ coughing)—to make a similar point. Meanwhile, in poetry I (or anyone) can replicate that idea in innumerable ways whenever I feel like it. No trumpet, guitar, camera, or other instrument besides my own knowledge of my life is necessary, as I always carry my words and the sounds of my life and the relationship I develop between and among these things wherever I go. There’s a reason poetry is one of the oldest art-forms: it’s something you can create alone and without possessions on a deserted island, or when your village and all its resources have been destroyed, or when you’re so stricken by fear or sadness or anger that you can’t lift your head up or reach for anything solid. And as noted already, it animates even those arts in which the words “sonnet” and “stanza” have no meaning. 7. No other type of artist needs years of groupthink-oriented, aesthetically essentialist “workshopping” to become what they need to be, and neither do poets—so the contemporary poetry “workshop” can safely be detonated. In the conventional poetry workshop, (a) printed poetry written in the then-period style is consumed by students, (b) little emphasis is put on how poems are performed and how the certainty of future performance can inform the writing of a work, (c) students are given identical reading assignments rather than helped to find the poetry they personally would benefit most from encountering, (d) poetry is treated as an aesthetic artifact rather than a meta-genre, meaning that students discuss it as though it were a means of self-expression with ingrained rules and methods and modes for self-determining its own value, and (e) classes are run with an eye toward the deductive reasoning needed to “fix” a single student’s work, rather than as celebrations of the inductive philosophical discussions of “poetics” that using student work as a jumping-off point can deliver.  Why are workshops run this way? Because it’s easiest for the instructor, who is probably a working poet themselves with other things on their mind—like their own writing—rather than helping to guide ten to twelve emotionally volatile younger poets on their ten to twelve incredibly complex, idiosyncratic journeys of artistic discovery. The conventional workshop is also less scary for such a teacher-poet, who’s likely (like most poets) an introvert, as it operates under a series of common assumptions about the purpose of the class, the structure of the pedagogy, and the general outline of a “good” poem that are knowable in advance. It takes faith in how poetry provokes novel considerations of language to permit students to pursue wide-ranging, wholly exploratory conversations—conversations in which student work is a dialogic catalyst rather than a fetish.  The good news: the contemporary workshop is actually an idea stolen from the late 1880s, when it was used at Harvard to teach advanced composition courses. That means the poetry “workshop” as we know it today was never intended for use in the discipline of creative writing, and is in no way suitable to or tailored to that endeavor. We can dump it or simply reinvent it right now without doing any harm to anyone. A redesigned workshop would center idiosyncrasy, poetics, error, exploration, performance, collaboration, multimedia, getting outside the classroom, and much else that has only a very limited place in contemporary creative writing pedagogy. 8. Poetry is something you chase, not something you do. To be a poet is to chase whatever “poetry” is through the channels of time, and since those channels of time are multifaceted and variously bent or straightened by things like technology and politics we can be certain that poetry is changing as time slides on. The gatekeepers of what poetry is or can be, or what a poet is or can be, are not very happy about the internet because acknowledging the internet means that poetry can’t ever again be what it once was. No more than sculpture can be for us now what it was for Michelangelo, given that unlike Michelangelo we have 3D printing, augmented- and virtual-reality modeling, and sufficient cultural bandwith to create “experiential art” in which the sculpture conforms to the contours of the user’s life rather than vice versa (see Meow Wolf for an example).  When radio changed poetry, that was registered in Ezra Pound’s Cantos, which was celebrated in its time if not as much as it would be after Pound’s death; in many respects, television entered printed-page poetry with the documentary, peripatetic poetics of The New York School; today, poets are struggling to accommodate the internet because it feels technocratic rather than bohemian, is too large and invasive a sea change in human culture to readily grasp, and is much harder to market in the book-publishing milieu that American poetry’s rigid subculture still idolizes. When I say that one “chases” poetry, I mean that the role of the poet is as much to determine where poetry is headed and to inhabit and explore that space as it is to perform (or, more commonly, to perform over and over again) what poetry was in some past moment. Poetry became a knowledge base—a skill-set teachable in the academy—in part to justify its positioning in the academy, not because poetry-as-art is static and knowable. In fact, poetry exists now, and is being permanently inflected now, in the technologies of tomorrow (e.g., advanced biomodification, nanotechnology, cryptocurrencies, haptic VR tech) even as poets are regularly publishing work that wouldn’t have been out of place in the 1950s. But that’s where poetry was; we should neither celebrate nor hold up as the Platonic “poet” one who is simply able to reproduce a form first perfected over a half-century ago. Being a poet is, in this respect, as much about a spirit of adventure, critical and creative thinking skills, and a high degree of self-knowledge (up to a “poetics”) as it is about distinguishing between a couplet and a quatrain. 9. The fact that nobody will buy, read, teach, or enjoy your poetry means that it’s the one thing that is totally yours. A little-known secret—even poets hush it up—is that the average book of poetry sells about 50 copies, mostly to the family and intimate friends of the poet, and even a top-selling poetry book (say, the top 1% of books of poetry published each year) sells about 1,500 to 2,000 copies, which means that it’s owned by 1.5% to 2% of the more than 100,000 working poets in the United States. Now how many of those who own these top-selling poetry books actually read them cover to cover? Unknown. Probably less than half. How many of that half deeply enjoy what they read? Probably a quarter. And how many of that quarter are (a) teachers of poetry and (b) would teach a given book of poetry to others even where the poet is not a personal friend of theirs? Maybe one-tenth. And how many who ever read that book will not only read it cover-to-cover and enjoy it immensely, but also remember it for even a year? Maybe one in a hundred, and even then it’s most likely to be the author’s best friend or his mother. But it’s still more likely, if you’re a poet, that your best friend secretly dislikes your poetry and your mother wishes you’d done something more “productive.” What I’m saying is that American poets have found innumerable ways to hide from themselves that no one’s listening: for instance, by habitually attending an annual literary conference that seems packed and therefore makes poetry seem vibrant; by never revealing to anyone their own books’ sales figures, and by frequenting publishing houses that pull the same sleight-of-hand; by pretending that having read one poem by a poet is the same as having “read the poet,” and thereby pretending to a broader knowledge of the poetry scene than any poet actually has; by fooling ourselves into the belief that when our friends or family “like” our poetry it means anything more than that our friends and family like us. But what if we took the opposite view? What if poetry became widely understood to be the only artifact you can possibly make that is potentially history-altering for others both holds every bit of its value so long as it channels everything you are? What if poetry, whether on its own or accompanied by guitars or translated through a camera, is the only thing humans really know how to make before they die that freezes in time what it was like for them to be alive? What if the old adage that says the only way to make a blank piece of paper less valuable is to write a poem on it also means that what a poem can be is not restricted by economics, culture, or the psychosocial? 10. If poets for once steal a page from a group of seeming adversaries—professional writers—they’ll start to save poetry by habit rather than design. When I teach professional writing, I often contrast it to self-conscious (often a euphemism for “self-expressive”) writing in this way: I note that a “professional writer” thinks first and perhaps almost exclusively about the experience his or her audience is having. The problem, of course, is that this sort of ethos, necessary as it is for professional and technical writing, has always been thought of as the death-knell for imaginative writing. After all, if one’s audience is in the driver seat, able to demand from the writer that specific forms and conventions be met before a document is published, whither the “poetics” of the author?  In fact, the delirious glory of having a poetics is that not only is it definitionally a relationship with language and culture and identity—and a theory of same—that’s entirely unique to a given author, it’s also a near certainty that the more authentically idiosyncratic a poetics is, the better performed it will be by the author and the more mesmerizing it will be for its audience.  No poem is worse than the one that was written to someone else’s design—that’s true—but it’s equally true that no poem is less likely to be effective for a prospective audience (which has undoubtedly, in that scenario, heard a thousand such poems before). My point is that many poets loathe the idea of developing an idiosyncratic poetics because they fear it will alienate their audience; they’re fooling themselves, however, as in fact developing an idiosyncratic poetics is the only thing they can do that will allow them to discover an audience for the long-term.  A poetry informed by a poetics finds its proper audience over time. This is especially true if we imagine poets wanting to reach a non-poetry-writing audience. Much like musicians don’t want to sing only for other musicians, or painters paint for other painters, poets who wish to be read by non-poets need to be less, rather than more, constricted by what other poets consider appropriate and artful. Poets should begin demanding of themselves work that could not possibly have been created by anyone else—work that is thoroughly (in form, content, concept, performance, and sensory contours) of and by them rather than anyone else. Poets and non-poets should demand this, too, of all the poetry they read, which may require shutting up a bit about the work of one’s friends and asking them to do the same for you (if you’re a poet). Only a poetry economy in which we celebrate that which delights us—not considering its author—is one in which we perpetually send the message that thinking about audience is okay, being idiosyncratic is okay, torching language and communicative conventions in the way singer-songwriters and comedians and screenwriters do is okay. What needs to be maintained in poetry, and what is threatened by poetry’s present provincial subculture—including the conventional writing workshop, the mob mentality of poet communities on social media, the cliquishness of cosmopolitan poetry enclaves, and the narrowness and inherent dishonesty of poetry’s publishing sphere—is the key element of surprise. While we should always seek delight in poetry, so too should we feel a poem to be a bracing wind that unsettles even as it inspires. Many of these ideas may seem internally contradictory, such as saying that poetry can move nations even as it perfectly performs the idiosyncrasies of the self, but in fact this is merely the “meta-meta-genre” quality of poetry that makes poetry even more awe-inspiring a human construct than I’ve averred here.  In other words, our definition(s) of poetry have, themselves, a poetics. Poetry is, after all, a system of seemingly contradictory ideas which, taken together, make the composition of poetry possible. Poetry would not be as rich as it is, or as resilient as it is, if its central character was purely political or, alternatively, purely personal. If it could not be disseminated via a market it would lose its cultural capital—or, its potential cultural capital—and that remains true even as we note that poetry fruitfully resides beyond economics. Creative writing pedagogy is crucial because it brings people together to wrestle with the question of what poetry can be, even as our current national pedagogy is harmful and ought to be discarded post-haste. Poetry is changed fundamentally by the fact that, like us, it moves through and is changed by the fourth dimension of time, but this doesn’t touch the fact that many a young poet was moved to chase poetry’s ever-retreating form by reading Walt Whitman as a child. Poetry is animated by Life, but often must traffic in destruction and reconstruction to do the difficult work of constantly refreshing what it means to be alive. And finally, as much as it may seem an act of prestidigitation, redefining what poetry is to view it as a meta-genre—present in the best music, cinema, comedy, and visual art—can be an essential act of resistance and redefinition even for those poets committed to poetry as an artifact for the printed page. So, is poetry dead? Yes. Did poets kill it? Yes. Is the thing that died the thing poetry is now? No. Which frees us to go in search of it. And what we find when we do, particularly in congregations of aspiring poets both in and out of the academy, is that the ideas above draw into the ambit of poetry many who currently do not—but should—consider themselves “poets,” such as pioneers in music, VR technology, and performance art. We find also, as educators and as those hoping to encourage aspiring poets in whatever setting, that young men and women who come to poetry to produce the conventional forms of expression we associate with it—that is, printed, lyrically self-aware writings—benefit enormously from seeing their palette of options expanded, as to both a poetics and the execution of a poetics, to include the principles enumerated above. Any fear that poetry as poets understand it now will be lost in the contemplation of poetry as it really is and can be sorely underestimate the resilience and flexibility of even “conventional” poetic expressions (and convention-oriented authors as well).  As is the case with so many other human endeavors, poetry ceases to be brittle when the discussion of it ceases to be brittle. The same goes for politics, culture, and self-identity in an age of such entrenched inter-human divisions. Poetry is a path we can choose to take, and that many more of us than currently do should opt to explore, as the best means yet devised to move up and out and away from darkness.

"When Derek Jeter spoke to fans at Yankee Stadium on Sunday to celebrate the retirement of his No. 2, the circumstances were dramatically different from those that surrounded another Yankee captain, Lou Gehrig, and his speech on the Fourth of July 78 years earlier. The Jeter ceremony was a joyful capstone to his 20-season tenure, scheduled many months earlier. In a powder blue suit and open shirt, he looked as confident and prepared as he had while wearing Yankee pinstripes. He had no reason to weep or to sense that his happy days would end soon. He was ready for this day, having retired after the 2014 season with 3,465 lifetime hits, the adoration of millions of fans, and a rich future. He has launched the Players Tribune website that lets athletes bypass traditional media to give unfiltered accounts of their lives and married the model Hannah Davis, who is expecting their first child. And, along with former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, he is pursuing the acquisition of the Miami Marlins, who defeated the Yankees in the 2003 World Series in six games. Gehrig was facing his mortality as stood before newsreel and radio microphones at the original Yankee Stadium. He had last played at the end of April 1939, with four hits in 28 at-bats and one run batted in. Once seemingly indestructible, he had played feebly. In June, a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis at the Mayo Clinic had provided him with the reason for the rapid disappearance of the strength and physical brilliance that had made him the Iron Horse. On that hot July 4th, his uniform rippled in the breeze, as if he were shrinking inside his Yankee flannels.  He was too weak to hold the trophies and gifts that were given to him.  His replacement, Babe Dahlgren, was deputized by a worried Manager Joe McCarthy to catch him if he looked about to fall. Gehrig looked wobbly. According to versions of the speech’s origin told by his wife Eleanor, Gehrig was prepared to speak to the crowd. He either wrote it on his own—or her help. He rehearsed it—but maybe he did not. As he headed to the field for the ceremony, he did not bring the text of his speech, and no copy of it has been found.  Through tears, he offered gratitude to his wife, parents, mother-in-law, managers, teammates and opponents. But mostly, the speech is remembered for its second line: “Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.” And for describing his life-altering diagnosis as merely a “bad break.” Demonstrating such grace after learning that he had a disease that had ended his career and was weakening him daily remains remarkable. Months later, he explained in a syndicated article that he had was grateful for his achievements since his poverty-stricken childhood as the son of German immigrants.  Gehrig wrote that he had thought of himself as the “luckiest kid on earth” if he could play on the high school football team, go to college and break into major league baseball. His “bad break” would not diminish that sentiment.  “All right, I’m still the luckiest man on earth when you add things up,” he wrote. “I’ve got a long season of life to play out and my team—America—is absolutely the best in the league. That’s what counts.” Jeter looks like he will have the “long season of life” that was denied to Gehrig. At 42, he did not look physically vulnerable. As trim as the day he ended his career with a game-winning hit, Jeter took a handheld microphone and offered his litany of thanks—to the late Yankee owner George Steinbrenner, his family, managers, coaches, teammates, support staff, and fans. He spoke with the confidence of a modern athletic superstar who shared a driven work ethic with Gehrig as well as an ability to avoid controversy. Without the sort of physical challenge that Gehrig faced, Jeter’s words lacked gravitas—as nearly every athletic goodbye delivered in a stadium or arena does. If Jeter’s speech is remembered for its oratory, it may be for saying that “time flies, memories fade, but family is forever, and I’ll be eternally grateful to be a part of the Yankee family.” For completely different reasons, Jeter could have legitimately declared that he was the “luckiest man on the face of the earth.” Jeter’s speech will not likely inspire great cinema. But Gehrig’s did. The producer Samuel Goldwyn was so moved by the newsreel that he agreed to make “The Pride of the Yankees.” Goldwyn knew nothing about baseball and ordained that the film focus on Gehrig’s courage and his love for Eleanor. Baseball wasn’t squeezed out of “Pride,” but on-field action was secondary, even with Babe Ruth in the cast. Gary Cooper, who had never played baseball, portrayed Gehrig. Whatever batting or field skills he acquired came through the tutoring of Lefty O’Doul, a once-great hitter. Cooper was lean and lanky, unlike the brawny and muscular Gehrig. But Cooper understood how to play men of quiet dignity like Gehrig. He had been doing it for most of his career, although he was nervous about portraying someone whose memory was still indelible with baseball fans. The film’s version of the speech is shorter and in many ways different from the original. The script instructed Cooper that the scene was a “crucifixion as well as triumph.” Cooper’s delivery was modest but powerful. He hesitated a few times and shed some tears. And he was finished with a rhetorical flourish thanks to the screenwriters’ decision to shift the “luckiest man” line to the end.  The speech over, he licked his lips, put his hand over his mouth and walked off alone into the dark solitude of the dugout. An umpire yells, “Play ball!” Cooper’s “luckiest man” speech has become the de facto version for the past 75 years because most of the newsreel is gone, leaving behind film of only a few of Gehrig’s lines. Jeter’s speech will never suffer the same fate.  Online, it will never fade away.

"Comedian Sarah Silverman said she “has compassion” for friends Louis C.K., Aziz Ansari, and Al Franken who were swept into the Me Too movement, and sees no reason why C.K. can’t resume his entertainment career. “I think that there are people who were caught and there were people who were not caught, but the important thing is that they are forever changed,”  Silverman told GQ for the magazine’s comedy issue. referring specifically to C.K.  “And if that’s the case, I don’t see any reason why they can’t continue being artists. Now, whether they’re popular artists or not is up to the audience. I have compassion.” Silverman opened up about the complexities of being friends with someone who falls under the Me Too spotlight. C.K. apologized and acknowledged that several women’s accusations that he masturbated in front them were true. He said he would “step back for a long time” from his career, which included live performances, TV series and movies.   “Fuck you! ‘Let me tell GQ about my conversations with Louie,’” Silverman said when the magazine asked about C.K. “Life is complicated. Love is even more complicated. But you can’t not do it. I don’t have some definitive sound bite or nutshell of how I feel about it, even to myself. But I’m also okay with that.” While some men who have faced Me Too accusations have denied the charges and “continue to be the politicians or the filmmakers that they are,” others, like C.K., have admitted wrongdoing and have vowed to change, Silverman said. “And yet those are the ones that kind of are excommunicated forever,” she said. He’s my brother, so it’s hard. I may not have a very clear perspective on it, but I’m trying to.” On Ansari, who was accused by an unnamed woman of impropriety on a date in a now-viral essay, Silverman said: “I was just like, Gross, I don’t wanna know that about Aziz! Hopefully he’s dealing with things, looking inward, and will blossom from it.” Silverman also talked about the former comedian, ex-Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), who stepped down in January after he was accused of inappropriately touching or forcibly kissing eight women.  “I believe in my heart of heart of hearts he never copped a feel,” Silverman said. “The sketch, the whole Leeann Tweeden sketch, is online. You can see it for yourself. It’s not funny, but it’s innocuous. He may have touched some sideboob by accident, or a tush by accident, but I’m telling you, [Franken’s wife] Franni is his best friend and constant companion, and he has eyes for no one else.”  Silverman said she believes Franken “got bullied into resigning” and that she’s “never met a more pure person.” “He’s a Jewish grandpa. He gives you big, Jewish, wet-lipped kisses. This is a guy whose passion was serving people and making the world a better place,” said Silverman. “There’s a lot of baby-in-bathwater stuff, I think. We’ll just get it in the process.” Reps for Silverman did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for further comment. Silverman previously talked about her feelings toward C.K. in November, on her TV show “I Love You America.” She posed the question, “Can you love someone who did bad things?” and talked about her conflicting feelings.",she,said,person
"Spanish actor Javier Bardem says he has “doubts” about the sexual misconduct allegations against Woody Allen and defended the director in a recent interview about his film “Escobar.” In discussion with French publication Paris Match, Bardem said he is “absolutely not” ashamed to have worked with Allen when asked if he was. Bardem and his wife, actress Penelope Cruz, both starred in Allen’s 2008 film “Vicky Cristina Barcelona.” “I am very shocked by this sudden treatment,” said Bardem referring to the recent scrutiny on Allen in light of the Me Too movement. “Judgments in the states of New York and Connecticut found him innocent. The legal situation today is the same as in 2007. If there was evidence that Woody Allen was guilty, then yes, I would have stopped working with him, but I have doubts.” Bardem did not elaborate as to what the “doubts” he had were about. Dylan Farrow, Allen’s adopted daughter, has accused the film director of molesting her. In a February 2014 op-ed published in The New York Times, Farrow alleges that Allen “routinely did things to make her uncomfortable, such as sticking his thumb in her mouth and placing her head in his lap.” Allen has denied Farrow’s allegations. In another question, Bardem addressed the growing Me Too movement. He said he was uneasy with the idea that women and men are pitted against one another: “I’m fortunate to have been raised by a very strong mother who taught me to respect women. Today, we have the impression there are men on one side and women on the other, which sends a very bad message to the younger generation,” the actor said. “The goal is not to be against each other but to be with others,” he added. Bardem’s wife, Cruz, has spoken out about the Me Too movement as well, telling PorterEdit in February. “It has to change the rules of our industry and all the other industries in which women are being repressed in so many different ways,” she said. “It cannot just be something that’s there to fill.” ",he,added,others

Stranded in a Dallas hotel room in August by the storm, Watt started a relief fund on a YouCaring.com page. “I honestly didn’t know if we could reach $200,000,” he told Fallon. The 5-foot-6 Altuve, the American League MVP, played a big role in galvanizing the city in the storm’s aftermath by helping the Astros win their first World Series title. “The city of Houston has treated me really good,” he told Sports Illustrated. “I felt at that time that I owed them something. So when they were having a hard time, I wanted to give something back to them.” The pair will officially accept the honor Tuesday night during an awards ceremony at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center.  J.J. Watt and Jose Altuve join a long and proud history of SI #Sportsperson of the Year honorees pic.twitter.com/ZfkkjrJWmr",I,wanted,them
"UPDATE: Jan. 14, 12:30 p.m. ― It’s coming down again. UPDATE: Jan. 10, 5:08 p.m. ― Is the painting back up, you ask? Why, yes. Yes, it is.  https://t.co/fSLzOjloO9 UPDATE: Jan. 10, 4:20 p.m. ― At 3:55 p.m., Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) and Rep. Brian Babin (R-Tx.) have once again removed the student painting from the Capitol complex tunnel and brought it, again, to Clay’s office.  In a video posted on Twitter, Rohrabacher explains the motivation behind this secondary removal of the work. “There are certain restrictions that apply,” he said. “If someone wants to do this in a private gallery they have every right with their freedom of speech, we support freedom of speech. But you don’t put something attacking policemen, treating them like pigs, here in the Capitol.”  What happens next is anyone’s guess. Well, the best guess would probably be Clay re-hanging the painting for reasons discussed below. Good thing there isn’t anything else super important going on today or anything!  Dana Rohrabacher and Brian Babin are taking the painting down again and bringing it to Clays office pic.twitter.com/d83Mj858bG UPDATE: Jan. 10, 2:06 p.m. ― Rep. Lacy Clay (D-Mo.) returned the controversial student painting depicting cops as pigs to its original location, according to Hill reporter Cristina Marcos. It is currently hanging in what Marcos described as “a highly trafficked tunnel connecting the Capitol and two House office buildings.” Clay rehung the work on Tuesday, surrounded by members of the Congressional Black Caucus, explaining to press, “This is really not about a student art competition anymore. This is about protecting the Constitution.” Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R-Calif.), the GOP congressman who removed the painting without permission, is “pressuring GOP leaders to permanently remove the painting,” The Washington Examiner reports. “So [House Speaker Paul Ryan] got to do something about this,” Hunter told Fox News on Tuesday. “I can’t keep taking it down over and over. That becomes kind of a tit-for-tat thing. Artwork like this simply needs to not be up. The Capitol Police are behind me.” Rep. Lacy Clay (D-Mo) put the cops-as-pigs painting back on the wall in the Cannon Tunnel pic.twitter.com/hN7tiXX0ek Previously ... A GOP congressman removed a student painting, without warning or permission, from the walls of the U.S. Capitol complex on Friday, Jan. 6, because of its contentious depiction of police officers. The image ― a response to the 2014 protests of police brutality in Ferguson, Missouri ― shows a policeman with the head of a boar aiming a gun at a protestor with the head of a wolf. In the background, protestors hold signs reading “Stop Kill—,” “History” and “Racism Kills.” On the right, a black man in a graduation cap appears crucified and holding the scales of justice. The controversial artwork, made by recent high school graduate David Pulphus, was selected by a committee of artists as part of the annual U.S. Congressional Art Competition in May. The piece responded to the civil unrest brewing in Ferguson, where the competition was held, following the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by a white police officer.  “The painting portrays a colorful landscape of symbolic characters representing social injustice, the tragic events in Ferguson, Missouri, and the lingering elements of inequality in modern American society,” Rep. Lacy Clay (D-Mo.), who represents Ferguson, wrote in a statement. Until Friday, the piece hung in the Cannon House Office Building tunnel that connects the Capitol with members’ legislative offices.  Not everyone, however, was moved by the piece. According to Fox News, over 27,000 law enforcement officials protested Pulphus’ painting, specifically its depiction of cops as animals, describing the work as “reprehensible, repugnant and repulsive.” Police unions in New York, Los Angeles, San Jose, and Oakland collected their thoughts in a letter sent last Tuesday to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan. “This latest indignation, sponsored by an elected official intent on pandering to professional protesters, unfortunately adds credence to a demonstrably false narrative about law enforcement that undermines the safety of law enforcement officers and those we protect,” they wrote.  Yet Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R-Calif.) acted alone and unprompted when he, on Friday, simply removed the painting from the tunnel wall and dropped it off in Rep. Clay’s office. Clay was out at the time. “It was an impulsive thing when I walked by,” Hunter said of his decision, in an interview with The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “It strikes a nerve ... You shouldn’t have something in the Capitol that depicts cops as pigs. It’s that simple.” In response to the many people offended by the work, Clay suggested thinking about the artist’s motivation for the painting, rather than just the piece itself. “The bigger conversation we should be having is, ‘Why does this kid feel that way?’” Clay told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.  Earlier this month, Clay released a statement explaining his refusal to remove the work despite its criticisms because of the First Amendment’s protection of provocative artwork. “I had no role in selecting the winner of this student art competition and I would never attempt to approve or disapprove artistic expression,” he said. “The U.S. Capitol is a symbol of freedom, not censorship. The young artist chose his own subject and the painting will not be removed.” Whether or not Clay will re-hang the work after it has been removed remains to be seen. We have reached out to Clay’s office for comment and will update accordingly. ",Artwork,needs,this
"ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis’ top lawyer Felix Ehrat is leaving the Swiss drugmaker, saying a $1.2 million contract he co-signed with U.S. President Donald Trump’s personal attorney was a mistake. The contract with Michael Cohen’s Essential Consultants, the same firm used to pay porn star Stormy Daniels, has distracted Novartis’s efforts to improve its image. “Although the contract was legally in order, it was an error,” Ehrat, 60, said on Wednesday. “As a co-signatory with our former CEO, I take personal responsibility to bring the public debate on this matter to an end.” Novartis ended the $100,000-per-month contract, signed in early 2017 by Ehrat and former Novartis Chief Executive Joe Jimenez, this year. It was part of efforts to learn more about how the Trump administration might approach U.S. healthcare, Novartis said. U.S. lawmakers have demanded Novartis and AT&T, which also made payments to Cohen’s firm, provide details and Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, has initiated an investigation. Ehrat, Novartis’s general counsel since 2011, had been expected to leave within the next 1-1/2 years, while Jimenez stepped down on Feb. 1 and was replaced by Vas Narasimhan. Novartis has said Narasimhan had nothing to do with the Cohen contract and Chairman Joerg Reinhardt said that the board of directors was not aware of it at the time it was signed. Ehrat will be replaced by chief ethics officer Shannon Klinger who Narasimhan elevated to the executive committee this year as he made cultural change a priority. Novartis said she had not been aware of the Cohen contact. Narasimhan called the contract a major mistake at a meeting with investors in Basel and said Novartis is developing a principles-, not rules-based system to avert corruption. “There will always be a way around the rule, whereas if you ask the question, ‘Is this the right thing to do, are you comfortable with this being on the front page of the newspaper?’... that’s going to help get us to a better place.” Since 2015, Novartis has paid out hundreds of millions in settlements and fines as a result of kickback allegations in South Korea, the United States and China and faces an investigation of alleged bribery in Greece. A trial for another U.S. kickbacks case is scheduled for 2019. Novartis shareholders have urged Narasimhan to exert more “moral influence” over perceived ethical shortcomings that Jimenez in 2016 blamed on a “results-oriented” sales culture and some bad actors. Klinger cited changes to bonus schemes for Novartis’s drug sales force that are meant to avoid potential for corruption. “Any one sales rep can have no more than 40 percent (bonus), so we think that by doing this we have also embedded our values and behaviors for our sales reps,” she said.  Narasimhan highlighted a dozen medicines in its pipeline that Novartis believes have $1-billion-plus annual sales potential, placing it on track to grow sales and expand profit margins through 2022. The company will also consider pruning non-core operations, including its U.S. generic pills business, while weighing further bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen its drug portfolio. Novartis is also considering whether to spin off its Alcon eye surgery division, with any move likely in early 2019, while priority areas for M&A include cancer medicine, cell and gene therapies, liver disease and digital and data science. Narasimhan made a big bet on gene therapy with an $8.7 billion deal to buy AveXis last month. But Novartis is unlikely to mimic deals such as Takeda’s $62 billion takeover of Shire which are transforming the pharmaceuticals industry, Chief Financial Officer Harry Kirsch said. “I don’t think there is a domino effect if some others were to merge or acquire large scale, that our hands would be forced in any way,” Kirsch told analysts.  (Additional reporting by Ben Hirschler in London; Editing by Michael Shields/Louise Heavens/Alexander Smith)",Narasimhan,made,AveXis
"The U.S. Marine Corps has launched an investigation into the activities of an avowed white supremacist in the military whom ProPublica and PBS’ Frontline linked to neo-Nazi assaults. Lance Corporal Vasillios Pistolis, 19, is stationed at North Carolina’s Camp Lejeune and assigned to logistics. He has been active with a number of neo-Nazi organizations, according to ProPublica and Frontline, which have linked six other current and former members of the military to neo-Nazi groups. “We’re looking into the allegations,” Naval Criminal Investigative Service spokesman Adam Stump told ProPublica. Stump would not discuss any details while the investigation is ongoing. NCIS typically investigates potentially felony-level offenses involving personnel in the Navy or Marines. The media investigations linked Pistolis to hate groups though records, photos and his own online comments to assaults during last summer’s deadly “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville. He bragged about the assaults online and was photographed appearing to beat a counter-protester. “Today cracked 3 skulls open with virtually no damage to myself,” Pistolis wrote online after the August rally, Frontline reported. 6/ In private online chats with other Atomwaffen members he talked about his desire to assault a gay man in Charlottesville and use his military training to kill his opponents “if shit goes down.” https://t.co/7d4tG3MEzX Pistolis has also been linked to the notorious Atomwaffen Division, an American neo-Nazi group that aims to incite a race war. Atomwaffen members, who idolize Adolf Hitler and Charles Manson, have been tied to five murders in the U.S. over a span of eight months, beginning last year. The group’s chat logs revealed chilling praise for the murder of 19-year-old gay Jewish college student Blaze Bernstein early this year. 2/ He also acted as a leader in the Atomwaffen Division—a secretive neo-Nazi group that talks abt overthrowing the US gov't & igniting a race war.

Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) wrote a letter to Defense Secretary James Mattis on Friday, urging him to launch an investigation into Pistolis and any other members of hate groups who serve in the military. Ellison also called on the Defense Department to provide information to Congress detailing how the military screens for white supremacists or other hate group members before they join. “The involvement of service members in white supremacist or other hate groups is cause for significant concern, particularly given their combat and weapons training,” Ellison wrote. The news reports may indicate a “broader problem within the military,” he warned. Pistolis told ProPublica and Frontline that NCIS had questioned him about his activities months ago, but the investigation was apparently dropped. Sources told the media organizations there was an earlier investigation. HuffPost could not immediately reach Pistolis for comment.",He,bragged,protester
"Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, a corporate attorney, won the Democratic nomination for Texas’ 7th Congressional District on Tuesday, reassuring national Democrats eager to flip the GOP-held seat. Fletcher’s win in a runoff reflects the preference of primary voters for a mainstream Democrat capable of appealing to enough of the affluent, suburban Houston district’s Republican voters. It also delivers a victory for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the official body charged with electing the party’s candidates to the House. The DCCC backed away from an active role in the campaign after provoking outrage among some progressives with a February opposition research memo against Fletcher’s more liberal opponent, Laura Moser. Fletcher finished first in a seven-candidate March primary, but the controversy over the DCCC helped propel Moser to a close second-place finish, setting up the runoff race. With Fletcher’s nomination, “Texas Democratic primary voters chose their heads over their hearts,” said Mark Jones, a Rice University political scientist who lives in the district. “Rather than opting for the aggressive progressive Laura Moser, they opted for the nearly equally liberal Lizzie Fletcher.” In November’s general election, Fletcher faces Rep. John Culberson, a nine-term Republican. Although Culberson has often easily won re-election, this year Democrats came out of the woodwork to challenge the deeply conservative congressman. Texas’ 7th is one of just three GOP-held districts in the state where voters narrowly opted for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in he 2016 presidential vote, making it a prime Democratic pickup opportunity in the midterm elections. The district went for Clinton 49 percent to 47 percent, a sharp swing from 2012 when it went for Mitt Romney over Barack Obama by 21 percentage points. The devastating effect of Hurricane Harvey last year has also made Culberson more vulnerable than normal. He promoted the expansion of an interstate highway that some of his constituents believe left their neighborhoods more vulnerable to flooding. For the most part, however, the district’s sizable majority of so-called country-club Republicans remains loyal to the GOP. Any Democrat hoping to unseat Culberson will need to convert at least some voters who traditionally support Republicans down the line, but might appreciate a member of Congress willing to hold Trump more accountable. Fletcher, who supports abortion rights and shoring up the Affordable Care Act, is more moderate than Moser, a proponent of Medicare-for-all and founder of the anti-Trump “Resistance” text-message app, Daily Action. Perhaps more important than policy distinctions, the two candidates differed in their styles. “Without question, Fletcher’s rhetoric and style were much more consensual and less anti-Republican and anti-Trump,” Jones said. While Fletcher had the endorsement of the establishment-linked group EMILY’s List, Moser drew support from less well-heeled progressive grassroots groups like Democracy for America and Our Revolution, the successor group to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) presidential campaign. Fletcher’s win is also a major setback for organized labor, which bitterly opposed her bid. She was anathema to regional labor unions because she is a partner at AZA Law, a firm that represented a Houston janitorial services company in a dispute with the Service Employees International Union, which was seeking to unionize the company’s workers.  AZA successfully won a $5.3 million lawsuit against the state’s SEIU chapter, forcing it to declare bankruptcy. AZA Law also boasts on its website of successfully defending a Houston-based oil equipment supplier against a discrimination lawsuit filed by eight current and former African American employees. Fletcher did not work on either of the cases but as a partner, she profited from them indirectly.",they,opted,Fletcher
"It's one of the coldest cases of all. Police in Denmark have been called to Vallø Borgring, the remains of a Viking fortress, over evidence of arson committed more than 1,000 years ago. ""All indications are that there has been a fire set at the gates of the castle,"" said archaeologist Jens Ulriksen, who is leading the excavation of the fortress, according to Copenhagen Post. ""The outer posts of the east gate are completely charred, and there are signs of burning on the inside."" The ring fortress is the last to have been built by King Harald Bluetooth, who ruled from the mid- to late-900s, according to Archaeology Today. We're proud to host a talk on the Vallø Borgring with the team behind the huge discovery. http://t.co/7TNJwM3BoW pic.twitter.com/FeBnq2tOhm “Our theory right now is that other powerful men in the country attacked the castle and set fire to the gates,” Ulriksen was quoted as saying. The newspaper reports that archaeologists have asked police to provide a fire safety investigator as well as dogs.  ""Hopefully, they can say more about how the fire was started,"" Sanne Jakobsen, communications manager at Southeast Museum Denmark, told Danish Radio, according to a translation from Sputnik. ""We generally have good experience of cooperation with the police. For instance, we have previously used their sniffing dogs to dig out bones from the earth.""

"A Republican running for Congress in Arizona compared abortion to the Holocaust this week ― a trope that has a long history in the pro-life movement. Wendy Rogers, a retired Air Force pilot seeking the GOP nomination in the state’s 1st congressional district, made the comparison during a campaign event in Maricopa, Arizona, on Monday after she was asked about restricting federal funding to Planned Parenthood. “The callousness that our country has for life is very disturbing,” Rogers said, according to audio captured by a tracker for Democratic opposition research firm American Bridge. “I have visited Auschwitz twice — maybe three times; three times. I have visited the killing fields in Cambodia. This is what happens to a country when the callousness for life erodes to that depth.” She further called Planned Parenthood a “despicable organization,” and criticized “crooks” in Washington for failing to defund it. “As someone who is 100% pro-life, I think what the Democratic Party has done to promote a Culture of Death is very much like the Holocaust - Planned Parenthood and other abortion doctors have killed millions of babies this decade alone - barbaric!” Rogers told HuffPost in response to a request for comment. Rogers is one of four GOP candidates vying to challenge incumbent Rep. Tom O’Halleran (D-Ariz.) in November. This is her fourth run for Congress, falling short in the primary each time. The National Republican Campaign Committee this year added her to their ‘Young Guns’ program.  Comparing abortion to the Holocaust is commonplace within the pro-life movement. Conservatives have similarly warned that other hot-button issues, like gay marriage or gun control, could lead the U.S. down the road of Nazi Germany. This has been updated to include a comment from Rogers.",She,called,it
" The Royal Society science office says the suspense will soon be over. It will announce presenter names/topics for the November evolution paradigm shift conference within two weeks -- democratically, by email to all those registered to attend the public meeting.  What's more, it has added to its original list of invitees.  Zoologists perhaps at last conceding viruses belong in the tent?   I understand that many of those in the Royal Society audience will be scientists as prominent as (and possibly more prominent than) some of the speakers, and as evolutionary science continues to be a tribal matter, it is expected to be a lively meeting.  As for whether it will be an effective meeting, i.e., whether deep divisions can be bridged -- I'm optimistic. I am reminded of something Markus Nordberg, CERN's savvy chief of Resources Development, once told me about the strategy of organizing such meetings: ""When you invite friends of the friends, they don't argue too much . . . so that at least you have a little bit of critical mass . . . but then you have to expose it.  That is to say, you organize a public meeting where the enemies of the friends are invited . . . it's polarized . . . people mix like hot and cold water.  And that's the point at which you are able to set up a collaboration.""
 However, grumblings about paradigm shift are coming not only from ""the enemies,"" i.e., the usual suspects (who are likely to send their disruptive ""representatives"" to the London gathering) -- but from more measured, responsible voices like Indiana University biologist Michael Lynch.  Lynch recently responded to my story about the Extended Synthesis crowd who've now been funded by Templeton with $8M but still can't agree on a definition for Extended Synthesis  with this note:     ""Superficial, silly, shallow-minded, self-promotional.  I and many others view this as a complete embarrassment to the field.  If one wishes to extend something in public, especially as a biologist, one ought to have a very good idea of what is being extended."" Even Stan Salthe, one of evolution's long-time progressive voices is dissatisfied with the fuzziness of language, emailing: ""Philosophically, the only difference between the earlier (new) synthesis and the new (extended) one is that the new one downgrades random mutation as the only source of new departures, allowing the biological system to potentially have some agency in its evolution during ontogeny.""
 There are some, in fact, who think the whole thing is a game of semantics and that I've ""been had"" regarding my interest.   Denis Noble, point man for the Royal Society conference, further addressed the matter of evolutionary science word play in a recent email to me: ""One of the problems I see in this field of evolutionary biology is that there are now a variety of definitions of what the neo-Darwinist Modern Synthesis includes. A recent reply to my J Exp Biol article even includes the inheritance of acquired characteristics!  But if we define the Modern Synthesis as its original formulation to exclude the inheritance of acquired characteristics, which was Weizmann's intention, which was followed by many others and summarized by Mayr, then the ES must be a replacement not simply an extension and it is so by definition.  Moreover, anyone who now tries to include the inheritance of acquired characteristics in neo-Darwinism is left with the question why it should any longer be described as neo-Darwinism since Darwin also included the inheritance of acquired characteristics in his Origin of Species and even, in a later work, developed his theory of gemmules to account for it.  The key difference between Darwinism and neo-Darwinism disappears.  There is then no need for neo-Darwinism. Of course there are many other reasons for replacing the MS by a more integrative, multi-process theory.  Those include symbiogenesis, natural genetic engineering, the physics of development. . . . . . . . . ."" No doubt the virosphere is implied, as well, somewhere in Denis Noble's above ""extended ellipsis.""

Clearly, the Extended Synthesis does not go far enough in reflecting current evidence.  The last major Extended Synthesis paper by Gerd Müller -- one of the fathers of the Extended Synthesis, who will be at the November gathering to explain his latest ES position -- was, e.g., virtually virus-free (the word virus appears one time).    Santa Fe Institute physicist Geoffrey West thinks the hard sciences definitely need to be factored into the equation at the November meeting.  And Adrian Bejan, author of The Physics of Life, will attend to make sure they are. Other prominent scientists who've registered include biosemiotics ambassador Kalevi Kull, and plant physiologist/ambassador František Baluška. Michael Joyner from Mayo Clinic and John Torday from UCLA's David Geffen School of Medicine will bring their medical perspective to the gathering, as will neurobiologist and developmental psychologist Jonathan Delafield-Butt, who's now busily organizing his own conference in Scotland on autism. I would expect both former Royal Society president Sir Paul Nurse and current president Sir Venki Ramakrishnan to waft in at some point during the three-day affair.  And that there will no doubt be tributes (whether formal or informal) to some of evolution's revolutionaries, now gone:  Mae-Wan Ho, Lynn Margulis and Carl Woese. But it may well be the presence of science historian and dramatist Richard Milner -- currently promoting the life of Alfred Russell Wallace -- with his repertoire of disarming songs, such as ""I'm a Genius,"" that proves most crucial to the November proceedings, that is, if chairs really do begin flying. . .",you,have,mass
"Ahead of Wednesday’s record-breaking auction at Christie’s, during which a painting attributed to Leonardo da Vinci sold for a throat-clenching $450 million, art critic Jerry Saltz voiced some doubts.  Saltz, in an essay for New York magazine, called the portrait of Christ “dead” and “inert,” suggesting that the artwork ― which had been predicted to fetch only $100 million ― is “a sham.” It’s “no Leonardo,” he wrote. Saltz, neither a historian nor an expert in old master work, went on to suggest that Christie’s sale would end poorly. “No museum on Earth can afford an iffy picture like this at these prices.” And then “Salvator Mundi (Savior of the World)” a 500-year-old portrait of Christ thought to be a copy when it was plucked from an estate sale for a measly $10,000 in 2005, sold for nearly half a billion dollars to an undisclosed private buyer. Suddenly, the controversy surrounding the painting’s authenticity ― its whereabouts over these last few centuries and whether multiple restorations had indelibly altered its surface ― became white noise. Christie’s had managed to rocket past previous auction benchmarks, brokering a historic sum for the seller, Russian billionaire Dmitry E. Rybolovlev’s family trust. Perhaps a museum lacked funds to secure the questionable picture, but a nameless member of the 1 percent surely possessed pockets deep enough. To most people, $450 million is an unimaginable sum. As Hrag Vartanian at Hyperallergic pointed out, that’s more money than the total estimated cost of the new Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City: $422 million. (It’s also reportedly more money than the Koch brothers are expecting to spend in the 2018 election cycle: $300 million to $400 million.) “This is a very small step for mankind, but a big step for the art market,” Frank Zöllner, a German art historian and professor at Universität Leipzig, who’s written a book on Leonardo, told HuffPost in a statement over email. “A heavily damaged painting by Leonardo, which was created with the substantial involvement of his workshop after 1507 or even later, achieved a record price, which is significantly higher than the sums that are called for modern masters.” “Of course, [‘Salvator’] is the symbol of a very unequal, even obscene distribution of wealth in the world,” Zöllner added. Art experts expressed concern with the $450 million price tag, well above the previous record for a painting sold at auction ― $179 million for Picasso’s “Les Femmes d’Alger,” set in 2015.  “I am deeply shocked by” the price, Stephen Campbell, an art history professor at Johns Hopkins University who focuses on Renaissance art, explained. “As a colleague said to me today, the 1 percent — who owns half the planet’s wealth — are looking for the last few places to deposit their wealth. This is a very limited, overvalued sector of the art market. ... The pricing could be controlled in such a way that a public institution could afford it. This is not a celebratory moment.” Campbell’s unease stems, in part, from the painting’s murky history, a pressure point for a portion of the scholarly community. Campbell saw “Salvator Mundi” in person six years ago. At the time, he was impressed by the lineup of experts willing to vouch for the work, as well as with the scrupulous condition report Christie’s released elucidating the painting’s entire conservation history. The report notes that X-rays and infrared reflectography revealed the signature pentimenti, or visible changes, that helped confirm the painting’s attribution. “That being said,” Campbell continued, “there is very little Leonardo visible in the painting that was seen yesterday.” Campbell estimated that only 20 percent of the painting’s surface was rendered in Leonardo’s 16th-century Italian workshop. The rest was carefully reconstructed by conservators, including Dianne Dwyer Modestini. And even that scant 20 percent is in question; there’s a possibility it was executed by Leonardo’s assistants, meticulously trained to mimic his style, and not by the old master himself. The true hand of the artist, Campbell said, is impossible to definitively discern.  “Most post-1500 [Leonardo] paintings are hybrids,” Campbell said. As a result, “when art historians say Leonardo, they’re talking about a category,” he explained. “It’s a ‘Leonardo effect.’” Campbell is not the only historian with suspicions. Art adviser Todd Levin and Sotheby’s senior international specialist Philip Hook have also expressed measured doubt about the work and its provenance. The painting that once hung in the collection of Charles I of England now appears cracked and worn, overpainted and slightly reimagined. Its whereabouts from 1763 to 1900 are unknown. It resurfaced, only to be sold in 1958 for £45 and disappear once again ― until it popped up in 2005, courtesy of art dealer Alexander Parish. Between 2013 and 2017, the then-consortium-authenticated painting sold once for over $75 million, and again for $127.5 million. “The attribution of this painting is hotly debated among Leonardo scholars and Renaissance art historians as it always happens with the discovery of new works by a major artist,” Francesca Fiorani, associate dean for the arts and humanities and professor of art history at the University of Virginia, told HuffPost. “Time will tell if the attribution of this panel to Leonardo will stick or whether in a few years the painting will look very different.” In a statement to HuffPost, a representative for Christie’s cited Luke Syson, curator of Italian paintings before 1500 and head of research at the National Gallery in London; Keith Christiansen, chair of European paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; Vincent Delieuvin, ‎curator of 16th century Italian painting at the Musée du Louvre; and Martin Kemp, emeritus professor of the history of art at the University of Oxford, among others, as experts willing to endorse the work as Leonardo. Kemp reiterated his support of the attribution during a phone call with HuffPost on Thursday. “There were some self-seeking publicity people, journalists, who tried to denigrate the painting, which was so expensive ― that was so valued. But they weren’t serious objections,” Kemp said. As evidence of Leonardo’s handiwork, Kemp homed in on several aspects of the work, including the mysterious orb that appears in Christ’s hand. “It wasn’t like an ordinary sphere,” Kemp recalled of his time gazing at the painting in person. “It looked like rock crystal. ... It’s not the normal ‘Mundi’ sphere. This is the sphere of the fixed stars, of the cosmos. So Leonardo transmuted it from being a savior of the world to being a savior of the cosmos. That’s the kind of genius he was capable of.” pic.twitter.com/WrJlHVJdjH As for the sum paid to secure the “Salvator,” Kemp agreed it’s “astonishing.” But the painting, which he described as the “spiritual equivalent to ‘Mona Lisa,’” is, he said, “worth what someone’s willing to pay for it.” “The people who are paying these sums of money undoubtedly would have undertaken due research,” he added. “It is largely a restoration, and it is a damaged picture, but so are a lot of old master works. It’s not the best I’ve ever seen, and it’s not the worst.” At the end of the day, Campbell concluded that the doubt surrounding the alleged Leonardo doesn’t matter, because, for all practical purposes, the attribution of the artwork was confirmed by the Christie’s sale. “As a colleague of mine said, ‘Nothing makes a Leonardo more than a hundred- million-dollar price tag,’” Campbell said. “The valuation works in reverse to justify the attribution.” Ultimately, Campbell said that he could accept the painting as a Leonardo, but he could not reconcile with its price. “It’s become a trophy, a market fetish. It’s being taken away from the interest of scholars,” he said. Lynn Catterson, a part-time lecturer at Columbia University who specializes in the Renaissance, the historical art market and 19th-century Florence, similarly described the painting’s value as “ridiculous and endemic to a planet whose economic disparities are worse than severe. And that is leaving aside issues of authenticity and provenance.” As Tim Schneider wrote for Artnet News, Christie’s revised fee structure saddles buyers capable of purchasing works over $4 million with a 12.5-percent premium, which ultimately carried the final $400 million bid for “Salvator” to a total payout closer to the half-billion mark. For cultural institutions with limited budgets, the premium allows private buyers to outbid them at auction, leaving cultural touchstones in the hands of the ultra-rich. This year’s Global Wealth Report, published on Tuesday, confirmed that 1 percent of the world’s population owns half the world’s total household wealth. Just as money has the power to shape democracy, so does it threaten to rewrite art history. If a seismic price tag becomes a more powerful indicator of masterworks than scholarly consensus, provenance and authentication, the sale sets a frightening precedent for, as Saltz put it, #FakeArtNews. “Most people do not seem to realize that an attribution is an opinion and, as such, legally is not binding,” Maurizio Seracini, an art diagnostician who’s worked extensively with Leonardo’s work, said. “Nevertheless, investors are purchasing art at incredible prices based just on opinions! No wonder why the production of fakes is booming internationally!” A $450 million valuation is then, by most accounts, unbelievable. However, if any artist could posthumously pull it off, Leonardo might be the most probable candidate.  “On one level, a staggering figure in the art market reminds me of global financial disparity,” Bronwen Wilson, a professor of Renaissance and early modern art at UCLA, said. “But I also find myself ruminating on Dan Brown, video games and lineups to see Leonardo’s works ― for the ‘Mona Lisa,’ ‘The Last Supper,’ and exhibitions ― which is to say that there is also something about Leonardo’s particular purchase on the cultural imagination that plays a role in this instance.” The cult of Leonardo extends far and wide. He’s become the mythical manifestation of interdisciplinary genius, a superhuman amalgamation of artistic talent, scientific acumen and unbridled curiosity. And there is still another Leonardo work in private hands: “The Madonna of the Yarnwinder.” As Campbell mentioned, it will be interesting to see what happens if and when this final masterpiece hits the auction block. Perhaps “Madonna” won’t match the hefty price tag of “Salvator,” suggesting soaring auction prices have reached their tipping point. However, if values continue to inflate, the art market’s steel bubble will continue to serve as a glorified piggy bank for the 1 percent.

"By Stephen Nellis CUPERTINO, Calif. (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Tuesday rolled out its much-anticipated iPhone X, a redesigned product of glass and stainless steel with an edge-to-edge display that Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook called “the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone.” The phone features wireless charging, an infrared camera and special hardware for facial recognition, which will replace the fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone. The home button found on previous iPhones is also gone, and users will instead tap the device to wake it up. But in an embarrassing moment for Apple senior vice president Craig Federighi, the face ID unlocking did not work on his first attempt during the on-stage presentation. The phone, which is priced at $999 and ships on Nov. 3, as well as the holiday shopping season that will follow are the most important for Apple in years. Shares of Apple were last down 1.3 percent after erasing gains of up to 1 percent during the launch event. The company has sold more than 1.2 billion iPhones over the past decade and ushered in the era of mobile computing, but last year had a substantial decline in revenue as many consumers rejected the iPhone 7 as being too similar to the iPhone 6. The screen on the iPhone X is about the size of the current iPhone 7 plus, though the phone itself is smaller. It features richer colors thanks to a new technology called OLED that other vendors such as Samsung are also rolling out. Apple also introduced the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus, which resemble the iPhone 7 line but have a glass back for wireless charging. The new phones feature Apple’s first proprietary graphics processor, which provides greater speed, improved cameras and some features for augmented reality apps. The cheapest phones have 64 gigabytes of memory, up from 32 gigabytes in previous models, and will sell for $699 and $799. The company also introduced an upgraded Apple Watch, which can make phone calls and access the internet without the user carrying an iPhone. The Series 3 watch will cost $399. Apple did not provide sales figures for its watches, but Cook said sales had risen 50 percent from the year before and that the Apple Watch was now the best-selling watch in the world. Gene Munster, an analyst with Loup Ventures, believes sales of the watch could double or even triple because of the new connectivity. The upgraded Apple TV will support the high resolution display known as 4K and will also feature more programming options as Apple steps up its efforts to cut content deals and produce its own shows. Cook opened the event at the Steve Jobs Auditorium on Apple’s new campus with a tribute to the company’s co-founder and former CEO Jobs, who died in 2011. The Apple building itself was considered to be Jobs’ final product, and Cook spent a few minutes boasting about the design, energy-saving features and public spaces at the new campus, including a flagship Apple Store. The theater, never before open to the public, features an expansive glass-enclosed lobby, with two massive white stone staircases leading down to the auditorium. Inside, the decor is similar to that of Apple’s stores, with hard maple flooring and tan leather seats.   (Reporting by Stephen Nellis; Writing by Jonathan Weber; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli)",phone,is,iPhone
"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Police in California’s Central Valley have launched a manhunt for at least one suspect after a series of 10 random shootings on vehicles left one woman wounded this holiday season, officials said on Thursday. Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims has warned the shooting attacks, which have occurred in her jurisdiction and neighboring Madera County, could turn deadly. “If this keeps going, it’s going to be a matter of time before we have a murder investigation,” Mims said at a news conference. “That’s what we’re trying to avoid.” Witnesses described the suspect’s vehicle as a dark-colored pick-up truck with oversized tires, Mims said. The motive for the shootings is unknown, the Fresno County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. A woman was struck by a bullet when she was driving on Dec. 1 in rural Fresno County near the town of Kerman, less than 200 miles (322 km) southeast of San Francisco. Her injuries were not life-threatening. In the other nine shootings, which occurred between Nov. 27 and Dec. 17, cars were struck by gunfire but no one was wounded, authorities said. Most of the shootings were in Fresno County, just outside Kerman with its population of 15,000 people. The drivers of those cars said they heard a bang, as another vehicle passed by, according to the Fresno County Sheriff’s Office. Investigators are not sure if a single suspect is behind the attacks, or if others may be involved, said Fresno County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Tony Botti. But Mims, speaking in general terms, addressed a single suspect during her remarks at the news conference. “To the suspect, this is a cowardly act and we are working very hard to find you,” Mims said. “We will hold you responsible.” Authorities believe the victims were randomly chosen. A number of communities in the United States have dealt with random shootings on roadways over the years. In 2015, 11 vehicles were struck by gunfire and a teenager was lightly wounded, in a series of shootings in the Phoenix area. A landscaper was arrested and charged later that year in connection with the attacks, but defense attorneys called into question ballistics evidence used to charge him. A judge in 2016 tossed out charges against the landscaper after prosecutors asked for them to be withdrawn.",officials,said,Thursday
"Well, having art and culture sure was cool while it lasted! President-elect Donald Trump plans to dramatically slash funding for the humanities when he takes office, according to a new report from The Hill. In meetings with White House staff, Trump transition officials have reportedly indicated that the administration will shutter the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, as well as privatize the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The Hill report notes that the floated budget cuts “hew closely to a blueprint published last year by the conservative Heritage Foundation.” It’s previously been reported that the think tank has been enormously influential in shaping Trump’s nascent administration. In the “Blueprint for Balance: A Federal Budget for 2017,” the Foundation devotes one page each to the eliminations of the NEA and the NEH, which is more than enough to paint a chilling picture for supporters of public arts funding. In its argument for closing the NEH, the Heritage blueprint proclaims, “government should not use its coercive power of taxation to compel taxpayers to support cultural organizations and activities.” On a similar note, it states of the NEA, “Taxpayer assistance of the arts is neither necessary nor prudent [...] Taxpayers should not be forced to pay for plays, paintings, pageants, and scholarly journals, regardless of the works’ attraction or merit.” Reached via email, both the NEA and the NEH declined to comment specifically on the report. “We’re not speculating on what policies the president-elect (or the Congress) may or may not choose to pursue,” Victoria Hutter, assistant director of public affairs at the NEA, told HuffPost. “We are not going to speculate on the policies or priorities of the new Administration,” NEH spokeswoman Theola DeBose reiterated. The act forming the NEA and the NEH was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965, in response to a movement to restore due attention and emphasis to the arts in an age driven by scientific innovation and exploration ― an imbalance that hasn’t gone away, as universities today focus on STEM and slash humanities funding. Though the Heritage Foundation blueprint argues that the endowments can and should be replaced by philanthropy, the NEA and NEH serve a unique purpose. Relying solely on individual arts giving and spending can leave humanities institutions and creatives at the whims of the super-wealthy ― think Trump’s foundation purchasing a portrait of the man himself for thousands of dollars, or, more typically, a moneyed New Yorker donating millions to her favorite opera house ― but the NEA and NEH take on initiatives in partnership with state and local organizations to shore up arts and humanities access in underserved communities. Government grants are offered to cultural institutions and individuals who submit outstanding proposals that hold up to objective vetting and review. The NEH has supported the creation of 16 Pulitzer Prize-winning books and Ken Burns’ iconic documentary “The Civil War.” The NEA also helped get the Sundance Film Festival off the ground. In a statement responding to the report, literary human rights organization PEN America denounced the alleged proposed cuts as a sign of a “new Dark Ages,” arguing: “The announcement that this is even under consideration casts a sinister cloud over our vibrant national culture.” Of course, shutting down the NEA and NEH isn’t as simple as a presidential decree issued on Jan. 21. As writer Celeste Pewter pointed out in an extensive Twitter thread, any proposed cuts to various government agencies would depend on Congressional budgets and appropriation: 2) DT can't just wave his arms and go: Ok, this is our budget for the next four year! Bam! Key point from the story. pic.twitter.com/bo5dh0qZRs Much as floods of phone calls from constituents resulted in GOP lawmakers backing down from a secretive push to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics earlier this month, voters opposed to the drastic cuts reported by The Hill can make supporting those budgetary changes deeply uncomfortable for their representatives. For those worried about a possible impending “Dark Ages” of the humanities, repeatedly calling congressional representatives to vocally oppose shuttering the NEA and NEH is a clear and practical next step: It could help save them.  Given Trump’s previously documented lack of interest in books and art that aren’t about himself ― as well as the Heritage Foundation’s power in his transition ― this latest report shouldn’t come as too much of a shock. But the drastic nature of the proposed cuts is nonetheless unsettling, and on the eve of the inauguration, offers a grim vision of what art and culture could face in Trump’s America if the people don’t fight hard to protect them.",universities,signed,funding
"There’s no denying it: Rarely a wedding or party goes by without Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’” being played. Released in June 1981, the song appeared on the rock band’s seventh album, “Escape.” Although it never made it to No. 1 on the charts, “Don’t Stop Believin’” has seeped into our culture in countless ways. The “Sopranos” series finale. That memorable “Glee” pilot episode. Broadway’s “Rock of Ages” musical. Your karaoke night. You probably know the words by heart, but you may not know the details behind the making of the song.  Journey keyboardist Jonathan Cain tells the story of the tune’s genesis in his new memoir, Don’t Stop Believin’: The Man, the Band and the Song That Inspired Generations. In the 1970s, Cain ― then an aspiring musician ― left his hometown of Chicago for Los Angeles in hopes of landing his big break. When things didn’t go as planned, he phoned his father for some help. It turned out to be a fateful call.  “My dog got hit by a car, and I was in Hollywood, and I had to pay the vet bill. And luckily they saved her life,” Cain told HuffPost at Build Series. “I had called him for some money, for another loan. And I hated calling my dad for a loan. I said, ‘Dad, should I just give up on this thing and come home? It seems like I might be pushing it back to Chicago.’ ‘No, no, don’t come home. Stick to your guns. Don’t stop believin’. I went, ‘OK.’ Everything he would say to me somehow I would just doodle in my little notebook that I wrote songs in. That’s basically what happened. He had said to me, ‘Don’t stop believin’,’ and I took it to heart. He sent me the money, and great things started to happen.” In 1980, Cain left his previous group, the Babys, to join Journey, replacing Gregg Rolie on keyboards. While writing songs for “Escape” with Journey singer Steve Perry and guitarist Neal Schon, Cain began to flip through his notebook.  “Steve Perry asked me, ‘Is there another idea around? We need one more song.’ And when I looked in the back of the spiral notebook, there was ‘Don’t stop believin’’ ... and I thought, ‘Well, Steve Perry would sing this if I can bring in a chorus of some kind,’” Cain said. “So I wrote this chorus, and I brought it in, and all of us together finished the song in a room. It was magical.”  Cain said they could feel the momentum of the song, particularly after recording it in the studio.  “I think when we finally heard the final mix, Neal looked at me, and he said, ‘There’s something special about this.’ And I said, ‘Let’s make it the first song on the album, because it sounds like it draws a listener in. Let’s make it Track 1.’ So that’s how we sequenced the album,” Cain said. “Don’t Stop Believin’” reached No. 9 on the Billboard singles chart, but he said he doesn’t recall that it was “a huge hit.” Years after the release of “Don’t Stop Believin,’” Perry ― the voice behind the song ― parted ways with Journey, leaving a big hole to fill. After a couple of other frontmen, the group secured a steady lead singer in Arnel Pineda, who joined in 2008. Last year Journey was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Although Perry attended the ceremony, he didn’t perform with the the band. Still, Cain thinks Perry enjoyed the moment. “He seemed very, very vibrant and proud to be standing there with us,” Cain said. “He lives a very private life, and he chooses to keep it that way. Whenever I see him at these events, he seems very, very happy, content with his life. I know he’s gone through some troubles, like we all have. But he’s moved on.”  Cain has moved on too. He said he hopes to work on some new music with Journey soon. And you can count on the band performing “Don’t Stop Believin’” on tour this summer.  “I don’t ever get tired of it,” he said. “For me, it’s an honor to have a song that’s loved by three, four generations by now … Anyone who gets tired of a song is working off their own ego. When we’re in Journey, we check our egos at the door.”  And as for the future of “Don’t Stop Believin’”?  “It’s like Thomas the train. It keeps chugging along,” Cain said.",Cain,said,album
"It was an inspired idea -- bring together 100 of today's boldest women leaders in sustainability, and see if they can produce an accelerated, gender-aware climate action agenda which can be implemented everywhere, from households and communities to boardrooms and negotiation halls. One of its organizers, Osprey Orielle Lake first approached me about the idea at the Durban climate conference in December 2011. And now it's happening -- the International Women's Earth and Climate Summit is happening right now in New York. The nature of the gathering might leave some asking: are women uniquely positioned to tackle climate change? 
Atossa Soltani of Amazon Watch and May Boeve of 350.org discuss fossil fuel campaigns at the Women's Earth and Climate Summit | Photo: Kelly Rigg, 2013 Data and knowledge of climate impacts that are gender blind -- that lump men and women together -- make invisible the disproportionate toll that climate change takes on women. It also hides the important knowledge that women have of climate change, its causes and its solutions. Women are more vulnerable to climate impacts due to their unequal position in society. Women are disproportionately affected by natural disasters: after the 2004 Asia tsunami men outlived women 3:1, and women who survived Hurricane Katrina faced additional personal danger (rape, for example) and discrimination in comparison to male survivors. In the developing world, women stand at the nexus of food, water, and energy. It is women who are responsible for food production and the collection of water and fuel wood, which makes them keenly aware of changing weather patterns that alter growing seasons, decrease crop yields and lower water levels. Adaptation pioneers With their unique knowledge and perspectives, women hold the keys to adaptation strategies and are critical to implementing mitigation plans at the grassroots level. The Barefoot College in India trains women to be solar engineers, simultaneously bringing electricity to communities, avoiding additional carbon emissions and empowering women with valuable skills. Energia International, led largely by women, uses knowledge of gender norms in the areas where they work in order to better implement clean energy solutions varying from solar grid installation to clean cook stove projects. But it's not just women in the developing world who play a central role in the fight against climate change. Polling in the developed world (in Germany, Australia, and the U.S.) indicates that women see climate change as real and dangerous in higher numbers than men, and they're more likely to take action against it. In Germany, the polling also revealed that women are more likely to believe in the power of the individual to protect the climate. That kind of empowered thinking drives NGOs like One Million Women, which works to inspire one million women to cut one ton of carbon dioxide from their daily lives. Women in high powered leadership positions also bring something unique to the table. For example, though women are only a small proportion of corporate boards, their presence is critical for bringing fresh vision to company governance. New thinking A study on gender inclusion on boards found that having at least three women -- a number that exceeds simple 'tokenism' -- caused a fundamental change and improvement in a board's decision-making: the perspectives of more stakeholders were addressed; controversial issues were tackled instead of ignored; and the dynamic of the group was more open and collaborative. Imagine if this experience were applied to the UNFCCC negotiations, where women are outnumbered by their male counterparts on the order of three to one, and where only 15 percent of country delegations are led by women. At last year's conference in Doha a landmark agreement to promote gender balance in the negotiations was adopted, an important step in the right direction. And let's remember, this isn't just about fairness, but about improving the quality of decision-making, as women bring important -- and different -- perspectives and critical knowledge to climate talks. So to answer my own question, are women uniquely positioned to tackle climate change? I say yes, for the reasons explained above. But being uniquely positioned is not the same thing as being solely positioned. When it comes to climate change, everyone has an important part to play. With that in mind, I'm excited to attend the summit, to collaborate with a group of incredibly passionate women from around the world, and to see what emerges from these discussions. And those who are not in New York are encouraged to join the Summit through interactive live-streaming during the plenary sessions each day. It will be a powerful opportunity to elevate the voices of those still underrepresented in discussions about climate action, and to promote stronger solutions as a result.",I,say,reasons
"“It’s a cold and it’s a broken Hallelujah” – Leonard Cohen I had never seen the actual painting, just poor, darkened reproductions. But I felt and understood the picture my grandfather painted in 1950 even before I laid eyes on it; it was painted as the family crisis escalated and my grandmother Mary’s impending breakdown loomed like an invisible wraith inside the home, something you could sense more than see. Shuffleton’s Barbershop is arguably Norman Rockwell’s masterpiece. It is chiaroscuro at its best – a noirscape of an after-hours moment in a small town barbershop. It appeared on the cover of the Saturday Evening Post in the spring of 1950. I felt apprehension, a well of emotion coming to the surface, as I sat in anticipation of seeing the painting in person for the first time. Would it live up to my expectations or disappoint me? I knew I was going to encounter my grandfather in a very different, more personal way this time. After researching their lives I now know what he and my grandmother were struggling through when he painted it; how they tried to shelter their three boys from the extent of my grandmother’s growing inner disturbances and the reliance on alcohol she hoped would soothe her inner wounds that were a mystery even to her. Her illness was their secret. Yet everyone knew. A bank of darkness had descended on what was supposed to be the perfect American family. The prevailing instinct is to protect that loved one who is emotionally and mentally ailing. And then to protect your children and yourself. Mary had dedicated herself to my grandfather and his work for over 15 years before she began to collapse. She had never individuated – she went from being an overly protected, isolated child to the wife of an already famous and successful American illustrator, 15 years her senior. And when the buried trauma and attending internal scavengers began to surface within her, she tried everything to find a solution – went to doctor after doctor, becoming attached to each one – until she snapped one day at a coffee counter in a service station in Arlington, Vermont in the dead of winter in early 1951. She broke down into uncontrollable tears as she sat with the younger family doctor who had been trying to analyze and help her. Perhaps in that moment she realized he couldn’t save her, he didn’t have the answers either, and once again, she was left with her overwhelming existential pain. She had improvised an infatuation for this doctor that was just an illusion. It is hard to separate Pop and Mary because in many ways they had always operated as a team. While some other couples slept in monastic side-by-side twin beds, my grandparents pushed their two mattresses together to make one bed. Each Saturday Evening Post cover was a labor of agony and love for both of them. Mary would often drive the models back and forth to the studio, cook lunch for them, scour the countryside for the specific props that Pop needed for each painting. My grandfather also used Mary as a model repeatedly. They had help – Pop always had an assistant in the studio and she had housekeepers in the home.  But when she began to seek out psychiatrists in the late ’40s, two of these male doctors unwittingly pulled her and her marriage apart in destructive ways. They questioned how she responded to her husband intimately without guiding her toward a real solution. They challenged her very concept of womanhood; one California doctor provided strange rules and edicts of wifely/female conduct. They began to open her up, yet failed to get to the root of her fragmentation, and then abandoned her. All of this swirled around me as I was led into a small side room at Sotheby’s in NYC – suddenly there was my grandfather’s painting on the wall, waiting for me. I felt shock that I had been granted such immediate access in this private viewing. This is the painting that had haunted me from afar. What struck me first was how much more light there is in the original than the reproductions – there is so much more to see. The influence of Rembrandt – his view of the “deep mysterious” – is unmistakably echoed in Rockwell’s ambitious use of glowing light and stark shadows. In the midst of the darkened room lit by secondary light, the radiant gold of the window sign letters and the bright orange of the fiery hearth call out contrast and almost beckon you inside. Hints and pops of color sneak in through the carefully displayed magazines and comics in front and the patriotic poster on the back wall. The observer is not just the black cat in the darkness with its right ear pulled back in uncertainty or annoyance; it is Norman Rockwell standing outside the cracked window – where his uncentered, diminished signature lingers – an isolated viewer, kept apart from the light of creativity and festive music in the illuminated back room. The older men play with calm joy, yet he remains an imprisoned outsider in the cold looking in. He is not completely alone, he knows his audience looks in with him from the same vantage point. He is quietly asking us for empathy – see, he silently nudges you, this is how I’m feeling, perhaps I’m not so alone after all. The symmetry of the two chairs with chipped paint like two guardians at the gate. The poorly painted window pane with layers of unscraped paint over the years, leaving paint marks on the window. The old broom leans against the wall as another character, its bristles peaking out from overuse. The startling clarity of the hot stovetop and the back light hitting the stovepipe where it enters the wall. A pair of shoes and a pair of beat up boots warm by the fire. The comforting softness of the worn ivory barber cloth draped over the arm of the chair; the channel of light from the other room exposes the intricate detail of the foot rest. Stray cigarettes from the day scattered on the floor. The revelation of the painting is the impressionist reflections in the back window – a play of gradations of gray. Pop always finds a way to surprise me. There is a tender dance between chaos and order, community and isolation. Pop had a number of reference photos of the cat taken. He enlisted his young son Peter and together they cajoled the cat into the correct pose; Pop sitting on his legs right by the cat, Peter on all fours, gesturing out in front. The first model, a round black and white tuxedo cat, wasn’t in the mood to cooperate. Pop replaced him with an all black cat with a leaner back who was more amenable. Did he really need the cat there? And why did he slightly cartoon its figure? Was it a form of slight sabotage to add that “Norman Rockwell” stamp of sentiment or did he feel he needed the ominous presence of a black cat looking on from the shadows – as he was feeling at that time? A grim harbinger of what was to come – perhaps Pop attempted to undercut the gloomy specter with a touch of humor.  When I stood back from all the details and silently took the painting in from the other side of the room a strange thing happened – the painting seemed to come to life dimensionally and allow me to enter into it. I was now the observer standing right outside the barbershop longing to be a part of the music in the back room – the barbershop opened up to me and I was transported inside – I knew that I could enter the lit back room if I wanted to. And that is the affirmation – it is the joy of art, of music, of community that saves us in those dark moments. It always saved Pop. Sotheby’s is planning to auction Shuffleton’s Barbershop and Shaftsbury Blacksmith Shop on November 13. Once again controversy circles around Norman Rockwell – people have always parasitically attached themselves to him, forged their identities by associating themselves with him and his work. He has attracted that sort of adulation and animus since his art entered into the public eye. People both revere and disparage his vision. Art is not created to stay in one place, it is created to move about and benefit the world. That is part of the magic of the artistic process – there is no true ownership. All of us are merely temporary custodians. These two paintings were painted in Vermont. Pop donated Shuffleton’s in 1958 and Blacksmith Shop in 1966 to the permanent collection of the Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield, MA. The Berkshire Museum decided months ago to auction much of its art, including the two Rockwells, in an attempt to reimagine its future. What would Norman Rockwell want? He would want the two paintings to be placed where the most people would have easy access to them, to experience his work for themselves. His art is the art of the people. If this auction goes through, Mr. George Lucas, I am calling on you... to save the day, rescue the Rockwells and become the faithful custodian of them at your new museum. Hope persists, in spite of it all.",Pop,finds,me
"QUICK STORY: There’s a Native-owned restaurant in Zuni Pueblo called Chu Chu’s that has some absolutely amazing green chili and cheese fries. It’s a beautiful little establishment, providing an important service to the Zuni people: it provides many of the foods that mainstream America gets to enjoy but with a Pueblo (and New Mexican) twist. Native entrepreneurs—you’re liable to walk through a birthday party or a first date or just someone who wanted to enjoy a pizza. Chu Chu’s also provides another important service for Zuni (A:shiwi) people: it is one of the few places where a person can get reliable Internet service. Zuni is a remote location where there is over 60 percent unemployment and very little investment into the area. Some 80 percent of Zuni people rely upon art for income—there are many Native communities with comparable numbers. Therefore, Chu Chu’s Internet access is crucial to the success and survival of the many artisans who support themselves by marketing their beautiful pottery and weaving and carving on-line. Chu Chu’s, and places like it within rural areas, literally become lifelines for an economy that provides economic development, self-determination and sovereignty for places where there has been almost zero investment. WHY AM I TELLING THIS? Unfortunately, the new Federal Communications Commission regulations, passed by the Republican-controlled FCC 3-2 vote, will have a significant effect on remote Native homelands and places like Chu Chu’s and their ability to provide service for Native artisans and other folks who depends on internet access to provide for their families. First, assume that Native people simply do not have access to the Internet the same way that most of America does. In fact the FCC’s own 2016 Broadband Progress Report that 41 percent of Tribal lands do not have broadband access. That means that even before the FCC took away net neutrality this week, economically and educationally vulnerable Native communities were already missing out on all of the benefits of widespread Internet usage. Native people trail the rest of the United States in graduation from high school and college, but no broadband makes things like web classes and Running Start programs inaccessible. Native communities trail the rest of the United States in start-up funding for entrepreneurial endeavors, and no broadband makes connecting for STEM or coding programs impractical. Now, in these rural communities where there are very few—if any—broadband options, the FCC has ostensibly given the Internet providers the absolute ability to charge whatever they want. The market does not protect areas where there is no competition, and in most Native communities there is no competition for Internet service providers (if it protects any areas at all). What that means, in practical terms, is that places like Chu Chu’s may not be able to provide the same lifeline services that it provides for the community. For my non-Native friends out there, understand that almost every Native community has a place like Chu-Chu’s where everyone gathers for a bit of Internet service and hopefully sell a hand drum or a carving or some earrings on their Facebook page. Understand also, that most of the time we are talking about 50 percent PLUS unemployment—that unemployment is not due to laziness or lack of initiative. Instead, it is due to a lack of infrastructure that is the direct result of government policies. And since Internet service is that rare in our communities—most business is done on cell phones on regional carriers; when there is service, the service is so weak oftentimes artisans and entrepreneurs have a very hard time uploading images of their work to platforms where they can sell. So it’s a big deal. Bigger than it is for the rest of the United States, even. HOW YOU CAN HELP. Look, I know folks are talking about reversing these new rules by virtue of the Congressional Review Act. Cool. Go on and reverse it (although I’ll believe it when I see it). I’ve been told that Trump was gonna be impeached many, many times. Here’s the thing: the rules were ALREADY skewed before these new rules went into place. Native people were already way behind in this digital economy. These new rules just made it worse. Here’s a couple of things you can do to help in the immediate: 1) SUPPORT NATIVE ARTISTS. Put some money in their pockets. Look, support Native artists everyplace, absolutely. Reservation-based artists have particular challenges simply because of how remote they are and how sporadic the technology is. The Internet is often the only outlet that these brilliant artists have and so it’s crucial that the work that they are allowed to get out there. Sometimes we have to affirmatively look for reservation-artists to make sure that their work is supported and appreciated. Collectives like Bethany Yellowtail that highlights Native artists is a great conduit for that work. Also support Native businesses like Chu Chu’s that serve as a conduit for promoting reservation economies. 2) SUPPORT THE WORK OF YESWECODE.org. We have to create coding opportunities and support infrastructure building within our communities. YesWeCode.org is one such organization that is working to create coders within Native communities. 3) CALL YOUR CONGRESS PERSON. Sure, support Congress People utilizing the Congressional Review Act to repeal these new rules. I have very little faith in this process, but it couldn’t hurt. But also understand that this problem is MUCH bigger than these new FCC rules. It’s a matter of investment and existed LONG before these new rules. REAL progress on this issue within Native communities will require infrastructure, a lot of money and commitment that is far outside simply reacting to a crisis.

"Honing in on Mormons’ strong tradition of missionary service, Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine reached out to the religious group with his own reflections about life in the mission field. In an op-ed published in the Deseret News, a Utah-based publication owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Kaine spoke about how he took a break from law school when he was younger to work with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras.  “They say that nobody comes back from serving a mission the same person, and that was certainly true of me,” Kaine wrote in the op-ed. “My time in Honduras became my North Star, a crucible of my values. It has influenced everything I’ve done in public life since: as a civil rights lawyer, city councilman, mayor, lieutenant governor, governor, and now, a senator.” The LDS church has been a reliably Republican religious group for decades. According to the Pew Research Center’s 2014 religious landscape study, 70 percent of Mormons lean toward or identify with the Republican party. Utah, a majority-Mormon state, hasn’t backed a Democratic candidate for president since 1964.  But many Mormons have not been fans of Donald Trump.  Several influential Mormons have been part of the “Never Trump” camp for months ― including the conservative commentator Glenn Beck, and the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, former Gov. Mitt Romney. The Deseret News has called for Trump to drop out of the race.  But Mormons aren’t necessarily fans of the Hillary Clinton, either. A recent Deseret News poll suggests that the two opponents are tied at 26 percent in Utah.  About 22 percent of Utahns said they’re voting for the independent candidate Evan McMullin, a Mormon whom observers say has a good chance of winning the state.  In his op-ed, Kaine attempted to connect with Mormons who are dissatisfied with the Trump-Pence ticket. He wrote about his work as a Christian missionary ― an experience that many Mormons share. The LDS church puts a strong emphasis on missionary work and proselytization. It has 15 missionary training centers throughout the world that offer young Mormons crash courses in language and evangelization before sending them off to 418 mission fields to bring new converts into the fold. Mormon men typically spend about two years in the mission field, while women serve 18 months. While all Mormons are not required to serve a mission, many choose to volunteer. There are currently more than 74,000 Mormon missionaries serving in far-flung regions of the world. As a result, several aspects of missionary work that Kaine wrote about in his op-ed would be familiar to Mormons ― from struggling to communicate in a foreign language, to learning how to accept donations of food from other people.  Kaine, a Catholic, also pointed out a historical similarity between the LDS church and his own denomination. Both Catholics and Mormons have been victims of religious persecution in America.  In December 2015, soon after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, the church issued a statement declaring that while it is “neutral in regard to party politics and election campaigns … [the church] is not neutral in relation to religious freedom.” Partly due to Mormons’ history as a persecuted minority in America, members of the church are often quick to denounce religious discrimination when they see it.  Additionally, because many American Mormons have served in missions outside of the United States, they are wary of the negative rhetoric against immigrants that often arises in Donald Trump’s speeches.  Kaine wrote about these tensions in his pitch to Utah’s Mormons:  “This election season has taught us some uncomfortable lessons, not the least of which is how a person’s religious tradition can be used as a weapon by politicians seeking to capitalize on fear,” he wrote. “Hillary Clinton and I pledge to stand with you against these dangerous threats to our American values, and for the safety and the integrity of our families. Americans may worship divinity in different ways, but far more unites than divides us in our values, dreams and traditions.” David E. Campbell, political science professor at the University of Notre Dame and co-author of a book on Mormons and American politics, believes Kaine's message will resonate with Mormons, since missionary work is an important aspect of their faith and culture. Still, he's not sure if it will have the effect the candidate is hoping for.  ""I would expect that this op-ed will, at most, nudge a few moderate Republican Mormons into supporting the Clinton/Kaine ticket,"" Campbell told The Huffington Post in an email. ""Its more likely effect will be among Mormon Democrats -- a small and embattled group -- who can cite Kaine's missionary experience as 'cover' for voting Democratic.""",candidate,'s,effect
"UPDATE: May 22 ― Retired fighter pilot Amy McGrath won Tuesday’s Democratic primary in Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District, defeating Lexington Mayor Jim Gray.  ﻿PREVIOUSLY: LEXINGTON, Ky. ― Amy McGrath’s campaign for Congress hadn’t even officially started, and it was already broke.  Last June, the former Marine fighter pilot retired from the military to move home to Kentucky and launch a political career. McGrath is everything a national Democratic campaign official would want in a new candidate ― she is a woman and a veteran, and while she isn’t a small business owner, her husband is. Still, she struggled to win over Democratic Party insiders in Kentucky and Washington, most of whom were waiting for Jim Gray, the popular mayor of Lexington, to decide whether he would pursue Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District seat instead. So in July, with a bit of money in the bank and desperation beginning to set in, McGrath’s campaign manager, Mark Nickolas, decided that he had to do something crazy. He told McGrath, who hadn’t yet unpacked from her move, to dig her bomber jacket out of a box. He took his fledgling candidate to Lexington’s Blue Grass Airport, stood her in front of a fighter jet, and told Mark Putnam, the ad man who has made Democratic candidates from Missouri to Wisconsin go viral, to start filming. The ad that resulted told a simple story: As a child, McGrath begged her congressman to help overturn the military’s ban on women in combat, to no avail. But the Pentagon reversed course when she was in high school. She enrolled in the U.S. Naval Academy, joined the Marines and became the first woman to ever fly an F-18 fighter jet in combat. McGrath relates this anecdote over b-roll of soaring jets, with a quick departure to point out that Republicans want to take away Kentuckians’ health care. You could discern the message of the commercial all the way from Paducah: McGrath is a woman and a fighter, and she won’t be deterred from achieving her goals.  When Nickolas answered his cell phone on the morning of Aug. 1, 2017, the day he planned to launch the ad, the voice on the other end had bad news: McGrath had raised just $50,000 so far. The ad had cost $57,000. Her campaign was $7,000 in the red, and she’d barely said hello. “I thought to myself, ‘Did I just destroy her career?’” Nickolas said. On the contrary: Over the next three days, McGrath became a national political sensation, a symbol of the wave of Democratic women running for office in the age of Trump. Comedian Sarah Silverman called her a “badass” on Twitter. Chelsea Handler invited McGrath to appear on her show. More than 1 million people watched the video, and money ― lots of money ― began rolling in: McGrath raised more than $340,000 in the 72 hours after the commercial first aired. What the ad didn’t do, however, was win over national Democrats ― namely, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or DCCC, which continued to recruit Gray. Neither did it push Gray out of the race: When he finally declared his candidacy in December, Gray held, according to McGrath’s own internal polling, a 40-point lead. But handshake by handshake, McGrath quickly narrowed the gap. Going into Tuesday’s primary, she was either fast on Gray’s heels or out in front, depending on whose polling you believe, and the DCCC has quietly taken the position that either Democratic hopeful will have a strong chance to beat Republican incumbent Rep. Andy Barr in November.  Ideologically speaking, there is little daylight between McGrath and Gray. The distinction between them lies mainly in affect and strategy, with McGrath continuing to push an outsider vs. insider narrative of the primary even as she seemed to become at least some of the insiders’ preferred candidate. While she may well lose her primary, McGrath’s campaign contains some lessons for a party desperate to flip districts like this one. She unabashedly pandered to the sort of discontent that swept President Donald Trump into office, but she took care to hitch it to issues like jobs and health care — particularly to the efforts of her state’s senior senator, Republican Mitch McConnell, to “take health care away from over a quarter-million Kentuckians.” Grievance plus stuff. Stick that on your lawn sign.    The challenge facing McGrath’s campaign was immediately evident for any visitor to her campaign office near the University of Kentucky’s campus in Lexington. Her opponent had headquartered his 2016 campaign for Rand Paul’s U.S. Senate seat out of the same office; across the drive, a small house still had a “Gray for U.S. Senate” campaign sticker plastered on the front door. And though McGrath’s initial ad had garnered her national attention, Gray still seemed like an obvious front-runner in the early months of the race: He is the mayor of the district’s biggest base of reliably Democratic votes and oversees a city with a 3 percent unemployment rate. He won the 19-county area by three points in the Senate race against Paul. And in a year when the DCCC is going for broke trying to gain the 24 seats it needs to regain the House majority, Gray is a bit of a luxury: a wealthy businessman in a marginally competitive district who has the ability to relieve financial pressure on the national party by self-financing at least part of his campaign. Gray also comes with progressive bona fides: A popular mayor who’s transformed Lexington, he supported removing the city’s Confederate statues; he’s a small-town Kentuckian who helped turn his family business into a construction giant; he’s viewed favorably by 77 percent of primary voters. He supports raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and expanding Obamacare; he touts a record of targeting utility monopolies that would seem to fit neatly into the new Democratic antitrust agenda. A win in the primary and again in November would make him the first openly gay congressman in Kentucky’s history. But what would ordinarily be a compelling biography instead became something of a liability in an election year that has thus far favored political outsiders ― especially when they’re women. In Virginia, Pennsylvania, Nebraska and beyond, insurgent female candidates have knocked off more established opponents with stronger-on-paper political resumes, feeding off the sense that Americans (and especially Democrats) want a new generation of political leaders to emerge. So what Gray and national Democrats saw as strengths, McGrath and her team instantly pegged as weaknesses. Without much room to differentiate herself on the issues, McGrath instead chose to paint Gray as a favorite son of the national Democratic establishment, the hand-picked choice of Washington rather than of central Kentucky. “I think people are hungry for new leaders, and a new generation of leaders,” she said.  “They’re tired of the old guard. They want folks who aren’t hand-picked.” The characterization isn’t exactly accurate: Aside from the Senate run, Gray’s entire political career has been spent on the Lexington city council or in the mayor’s office, and he’s hardly been a prominent voice in statewide or national Democratic politics. But by playing up her status as an outsider ― a veteran, a mother, a woman, three things she says there aren’t enough of in Congress ― McGrath’s narrative has taken hold nonetheless, and her calls to shake up Congress have resonated strongly against Gray’s safer, duller call to “send some adult supervision to Washington.” Yet as McGrath’s national profile grew after her first ad, she remained relatively unknown and perhaps even a little suspect to Kentucky voters. A native of Edgewood in northern Kentucky, she’d never lived in the central part of the state and had only relocated to the district in June, upon retiring from the U.S. Naval Academy.  (Gray attempted to punch back on this point in the race’s closing days, releasing an ad that hit McGrath for only recently moving to Kentucky. But groups like VoteVets, a nonprofit that promotes veteran candidates and their issues, have slammed the ad as an attempt to “swift-boat” McGrath’s campaign.) Even before Gray entered the race, Nickolas, who had managed former Rep. Ben Chandler’s (D) successful 6th District campaign in 2004, outlined an aggressive retail politicking strategy to get McGrath in front of voters ― not just on TV, but in their homes, churches, billboards and mailboxes. Nickolas ― who thought he was out of politics for good until Chandler urged him to meet with McGrath ― said he was instantly swayed by her grasp of the issues and the realities of politics, which she had honed during stints working for Rep. Susan Davis (D-Calif.) in Congress during her time in the military. Most of all, he was impressed by her passion, and he banked on his belief that if they had to chance to meet her, Kentucky voters would feel the same. McGrath, meanwhile, purchased ad space in every local newspaper in the district and published an editorial detailing why she had chosen to run now, in 2018, and here, in central Kentucky. She piggybacked off the popularity of the initial ad, which gained her thousands of social media followers, to hold Q&A’s with voters in the district that were broadcast on Facebook. She hit all 19 counties in her first few months in the race, stumping across the region and spending hours, even days, in areas that had once been reliable Democratic strongholds but have trended red for more than a decade. In a district where Democrats still hold a registration advantage, she has pushed the message that the national party has abandoned its voters here. “The Democrats here feel left behind by the national party,” she said. “The national party, to them, is Washington D.C. They don’t have the same values. They’re led by San Francisco and New York. They don’t see leaders from here or the Midwest. And they’re focused on the wrong things.” Led by San Francisco and New York. You don’t need a decoder pin to understand what McGrath is getting at. But she goes no further. She doesn’t counterpose issues of identity — transgender access to bathrooms, women’s rights, race — against the economic concerns of white, working-class voters. McGrath is pro-choice. She’s a vocal critic of Trump’s efforts to ban transgender people from the military. She thinks his effort to ban refugees and immigrants from majority Muslim countries is discriminatory and misguided.  McGrath doesn’t shy away from those issues when voters bring them up, and she believes her military service helps bridge the gap between the two sides when they do disagree. But she’s primarily focused on what she sees as the concerns that the district’s old-school Democrats who’ve been voting Republican still share with the national party: chiefly, health care and the economy.  She has argued for not just protecting the Affordable Care Act but expanding it to include a public option and a lower age of eligibility for Medicare, against the Republican tax cut package for which incumbent Barr voted, and for raising the minimum wage. She describes herself as a “fiscal conservative,” but mostly to score points off of Barr for passing deficit-fattening tax cuts after years of fear-mongering on that very same issue.  And in a direct appeal to the rural parts of the district, she’s advocated for an expansive role for the federal government, arguing that it should invest heavily in broadband, infrastructure, and job and economic development in areas left behind by the decline of manufacturing and the collapse of the coal industry. “We ought to have the federal government funding high-speed broadband in those areas. And we ought to do it for our country,” McGrath argued during an interview in her Lexington campaign office. “Eisenhower didn’t say, ‘Let’s let private industry build the highways.’ No, the government did that. And it powered our country. FDR brought electricity to Appalachia. The federal government did that.” McGrath speaks in a folksy, unpolished manner, with the occasional curse word slipping out, her voice rising and falling and sometimes cracking as she talks about the ugly direction the country she fought for has taken, or about Barr’s vote to repeal the health care law that gave thousands of local residents coverage for the first time. “The average household income here in Kentucky is about $50,000. That’s not a lot,” she said. “When you have Andy Barr coming in and saying, ‘I’m going to repeal Obamacare and give you health savings accounts’ ― dude, they don’t have the money for health savings accounts.” The more Kentuckians have gotten to see of McGrath, the more the message she’s aiming for has set in.  “A lot of people say they want to shake things up. She’s believable in that regard, just because of her demeanor,” said Al Cross, a veteran Kentucky political journalist. “She comes across as somebody who wants to get things done and won’t take no for an answer.” That invocation of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, meanwhile, isn’t an accident ― it was the New Deal and the local economic populists who supported it, like former Kentucky Sen. (and Vice President) Alben Barkley, who painted the state blue a century ago. In a state where Democrats have continually lost ground over the last decade, McGrath is arguing that “we have to talk about the things that made these people Democrats in the first place,” Cross said. “FDR is the guy who confirmed people as Democrats. And Alben Barkley did too. And it’s been a long time since either of those guys were around.” Even before the polls began to shift, there were signs that the strategy was working. Last fall, McGrath traveled to Anderson County ― one of the district’s largest counties ― to meet with Ben Carlson, the conservative editor of the local daily newspaper, the Anderson News. Carlson was impressed, not just by McGrath, but by the enthusiasm people had about her. “I haven’t sensed, in a congressional race, this kind of enthusiasm for a candidate in the 12 years I’ve been running the paper. For either party,” Carlson said. “She’s brought that kind of excitement to it.” To Nickolas, that’s evidence that this sort of hyperlocal campaigning in districts where voters increasingly feel detached from both sides of the national debate can help Democrats win back seats.  “I think it’s a reminder that sometimes we get away from the fundamentals,” Nickolas said. “We get seduced by the latest way of communicating. Too many campaigns put their money on TV and digital, and what suffers is the old school face-to-face communication with voters.” McGrath’s style of campaigning, Nickolas believes, is crucial for Democrats in purplish districts like Kentucky’s 6th. The grievance gets people’s attention; the stuff gets their votes. “They want to know: ‘Are you going to go to Congress and represent me? Are you going to care about me?’” Nickolas said. “She leads with that: ‘We may not agree on some of the issues. But you should believe that I’m going to have your back.’” He continued: “You can be a progressive and still do well in more conservative areas, as long as those rural voters get a sense that you’ll fight for them.”",who,is,Sen.
"John Nation just wanted to give teenagers in Bristol, southwest England, a safe place to spray-paint without fear of arrest and prosecution. Little did the then 21-year-old youth worker know back in 1984 that his “Aerosol Art Project” at the Barton Hill Youth Center would go some way to shaping British and global street art over the coming years and decades. It spawned an entire generation of influential and genre-defining artists ― including Banksy. But as Nation, now 54, told HuffPost in a wide-ranging interview, the initiative also almost ended up costing him his job, his reputation and his liberty. Nation was just 18-years-old when, in 1981, he became an outreach worker at the youth center in his home neighborhood of Barton Hill. “We helped kids deal with the nitty gritty of life [...] providing sexual health awareness, talking about drugs, that kind of thing,” he told HuffPost. A trip to Amsterdam in 1982 sparked an interest in graffiti, which he saw adorning the Dutch capital’s streets. “I started reading whatever material I could.” Coincidentally, some of the 14 to 19-year-olds attending the center were also becoming interested in the art form. Inspired by movies such as “Wild Style” and “Beat Street” and the painting of Bristol’s earliest-recognized graffiti artist 3D (a.k.a. Robert Del Naja from Massive Attack), Nation said they’d spend hours copying outlines of the work featured in the seminal book “Subway Art.” When one teen returned from New York City with photographs of the graffiti he’d seen, Nation allowed the teen and his friends to paint the club’s front wall. “Barton Hill was rough,” Nation said. “At that time the club was very territorial, seen as right wing, predominantly white and very hostile to outsiders.” Its exterior walls, he said, were mainly daubed with anti-authority slogans such as “No Police State in Barton Hill” or ones promoting the far-right movement, the National Front. “These guys produced a piece that was so vibrant,” Nation said. “It helped break down some barriers. Lots of these guys listened to hip hop, reggae and black-inspired music. Lots of the artists they looked up to were black, hispanic and Puerto Rican, but they were in a predominantly white area. Being involved in graffiti opened their eyes and helped to lower their prejudices.” Inspired by what the teens had produced, Nation sought permission from his employers at the now-defunct Avon County Council authority to set up the “Barton Hill Aerosol Art Project” — a place he envisioned would let the youngsters, some of whom were only a bit younger than him, to “express themselves freely and legally” on the center’s walls instead of tagging or painting unauthorized spots on public or private property which could lead to their arrest. Cheo and Inkie were among the first generation of budding street artists to attend the center, which had the added appeal of being the only one in the city with an indoor skate ramp. Before long, the artists covered most of the building with their work. “Once word got out that it was a safe environment to paint and look at books and photographs and watch films about graffiti, then people from across the city started coming,” Nation said. “Once you had that one group of people give it their seal of approval, others saw it was safe and followed suit.” At its peak, more than 40 youngsters regularly attended the project. Graffiti writers from across the U.K. also visited, and it inspired other authorities from around the country to launch similar initiatives.  “It was a great atmosphere, very expressive, very creative,” Nation added. “There was never any bad vibes or competition, none of that element. It was all about being a crew and a togetherness and I still think that’s true to all the guys who still know each other and paint now.” Not everyone was in favor of the project, however. Unbeknownst to Nation, from 1988 to 1989 the British Transport Police surveilled the center and several of its artists as part of a city-wide investigation into graffiti tagging and criminal behavior. John Nation Operation Anderson sought to profile graffiti artists suspected of criminal damage and culminated with a series of raids on properties across the region. Police arrested dozens of people, including Nation. Officers searched his home and the center. “Bearing in mind that I was running an aerosol art project, there was no way there wasn’t going to be any material at the center,” he said. “It was like an Aladdin’s Cave for them.” Police seized a “massive stash of paint” Nation had procured from the project’s sponsors and his treasured 5,000-plus snaps of graffiti he’d either taken himself or been sent by writers from around the world.  Nation believes police thought the club was “some kind of ‘Axis of Evil’ that was the main meeting point for all of Bristol’s illegal graffiti writers and a place where other writers from across the country would come.”  “It wasn’t that at all though,” he said, although he acknowledges some of the artists were painting on unauthorized spots on their own.  As was revealed in the BBC documentary “Drawing The Line,” (above), police matched tags on the artwork in the club to tags on illegal works across the city.  They charged several artists with criminal damage. Nation himself was charged with suspicion of conspiracy to incite individuals to commit criminal damage.  “Their main case against me was that the photos and books I had, if shown to a young person of impressional age, would incite them to go out and commit criminal damage,” Nation said. “They also said I was covering up for the young people and I was duty bound to divulge information on them. But I didn’t assist them whatsoever. I answered ‘no comment’ to pretty much everything.” Several artists were found guilty of criminal damage and received fines. Nation’s charge, however, was dropped on the day his trial was due to begin after prosecutors offered no evidence of incitement.  A post shared by John Nation (@johnnation) on Jun 1, 2017 at 8:53am PDT Nation says he then consciously used the subsequent press coverage to promote his project’s work and to argue that without a place to legally paint, “the illegal culture of the art form just gets reinforced.” Following the police raids, Nation says many of those involved in the city’s street art scene went “underground for a while.” “It was like they were regrouping,” he said. “Many of the guys arrested took a break, lessened their illegal activities, and some decided painting legally was the only way.” Nation says the publicity did inspire, however, a new generation of artists to begin visiting the project ― with one of them being Banksy. “As a young boy, he’d come to the center and watch people paint. He was heavily into hip hop culture, graffiti, and Barton Hill was where it was happening. Every weekend there was fresh work going up on the walls and people would exchange ideas,” Nation said.  “He says he called it his religious pilgrimage every weekend to go. Many of these guys had their own crazy, little dreams and he said what Barton Hill showed him was very powerful, that you could go on to follow those dreams.” At that time, Nation says Banksy (who despite multiple attempts and theories has never been officially identified), wasn’t producing the political or social commentary pieces that he’s since become globally famous for.  As part of a crew with some slightly older teens, Nation says he was “into graffiti and letterforms and writing.” He also didn’t stand out “as one of the graffiti writers you’d call a ‘top boy,’” nor was he using his “Banksy” moniker either, says Nation. “The Banksy thing came later.” Nation claims Banksy is “without doubt” the biggest contemporary artist in the world right now, but admits he didn’t foresee his rise to prominence during his early days of painting at the center. Instead, he believes Banksy truly began to make his mark when he changed his style and began using stencils. “Not only could he paint quicker, he could paint more locations and produce more work. He started off with quite crude stencil work, like the rats, then he started progressing to more clean work, more sharper,” Nation said. “These smaller stencils started appearing across the city and for me, it’s once he made that conscious decision to change the style of what he was painting and the content of what he was painting when he exploded,” he added. Banksy himself admits in his book “Wall and Piece” that his switch in style came when aged 18 transport police chased him through a thorny bush after spotting him painting “LATE AGAIN” on the side of a train. “The rest of my mates made it to the car and disappeared so I spent over an hour hidden under a dumper truck with engine oil leaking all over me,” he wrote. “As I lay there listening to the cops on the tracks I realized I had to cut my painting time in half or give up altogether. I was staring straight up at the stenciled plate on the bottom of a fuel tank when I realized I could just copy that style and make each letter three feet high.” Nation said that change led Banksy to “strike an accord with first and foremost the Bristol public, and then the British public.” “Lots of people who wouldn’t be into street art could relate to the simplicity and the fun and the characters he was painting. As he’s become more mature, the images and message have become more hard-hitting — he’s a clever guy.”  A post shared by Banksy (@banksy) on May 7, 2017 at 6:40am PDT Nation does question how Banksy creates some of his works, such as the “Brexit” piece (above) that he unveiled in Dover, southeast England, in May as a commentary on the U.K.’s referendum vote to leave the European Union. “Yes he painted it, but he’s got to have a team of people that set up the scaffold and he must have approached the people who own the property before that,” Nation said. “You can’t just rock up and set up a scaffold on the side of someone’s property without there being no questions asked. It’s a huge wall. It’s massive.” With so much history between Nation and Banksy, one may assume the pair remain close and in touch. When faced with the suggestion, however, Nation responded with a stony silence before changing the subject. While the legacy of the Barton Hill Youth Center often focuses on Banksy, many of the center’s other alum have also gone on to enjoy hugely successful careers. Jody Thomas, who in April gave HuffPost a helping hand in unveiling its new logo (below), has painted and exhibited his signature photo-realistic style around the world: But for him, it also all began at the center, which he first attended when he was just 15 years old after being encouraged by a school friend who’d described Nation to him as “outspoken, politically militant and not one to suffer fools.”  “It felt like I was being led to meet the leader of a despotic cult,” Thomas told HuffPost, adding that Nation “didn’t disappoint” when he finally met him.  “He immediately went through my school folder of work based around the comic art of 2,000 A.D. and classical painting and drawings,” he said. “I think he saw in me the opportunity to add a different artistic dimension to the club’s repertoire and left me to recreate on the walls of the club what I had on paper.” Jody Thomas Thomas credits Nation as being at “the forefront” of the street art movement at that time. “His energy and personality has garnered him an amount of respect amongst Bristolians on the level of any rock star or public figure,” he said. “For me, he is the ‘Darwin’ of street art in the U.K. and gave me a opportunity to express the art that spoke to me all those years ago.” The admiration is mutual. Nation still remembers the day that Thomas first brought in his work which was “totally different” to what was being produced in the club at the time. “I thought to myself, ‘fucking hell, this is amazing. He’s 15 and painting like this?’ I thought, ‘this boy is going to go far,’” Nation said. “At first he wasn’t accepted as much by the graffiti lads. Jody was into indie music and a lot of that music had dark imagery on its album sleeves,” he added. “He embraced that kind of artwork. He painted small pieces, then he painted these two black and white heads (below) and that was it. I have a lot of time for him. He didn’t stick to what everyone else was doing. He just wanted to be an artist and express his talents.” Inkie, a.k.a. Tom Bingle, also emerged from the center. He’s since worked as a head of design at SEGA and hosted his own shows across the globe. Recently, he painted alongside Shepard Fairey, the artist behind the “Hope” poster that came to define former President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign. For Inkie, Nation’s project acted as a vital “central hub” for the city’s graffiti artists in the pre-internet era of the late ‘80s to mid-90s. “Without this center and John’s support of our artwork, Bristol would not have had the scene it maintains today,” he told HuffPost. By 1991, however, Nation had become disillusioned with the restraints he felt the authority was putting on him and quit. “I was seen as being quite outspoken, left wing and a bit of a socialist,” he said. “But I’m proud of what I did back then. And the fact that people still talk about then and what I achieved for me is justification for what I did do.” Nation went on to forge a successful career in promoting dance music events across the U.K. and the NASS action sports and music show in Somerset.  With the explosion in the popularity of street art, which he puts principally down to the rise of the internet and social media, he’s since come full circle ― and now gives regular tours of Bristol’s scene via the WhereTheWall tour. “People from all over the world come, and no one tour is the same. Street art is here today, gone tomorrow. The art form is transient,” he said. In April, Nation curated his first ever solo show, “Graffiti Nation,” at Bristol’s Upfest gallery, the home of Europe’s largest live street art festival. He also worked with Inkie on the “See No Evil” art exhibition in 2011 and 2012, and remains a fierce advocate for spaces where artists can legally paint. He’s also set to feature in another BBC documentary, which will analyze the U.K. street art scene in the decades since Operation Anderson. Nation’s pedigree, knowledge and influence of street art and the genres that umbrella term encompasses have seen him nicknamed the “Godfather” of the Bristol (and increasingly British) scene. But it’s a label that doesn’t sit well with him. “I look back and I feel that all those years ago I was vilified and I could have possibly lost my job,” he said. “Then two years ago I’m being used as the face of Bristol tourism as someone who represents it as a progressive, cultural city. Who would have thought it?” “I get called the ‘Godfather,’ but I’m not. I just had a faith and a belief in these young people when no one else would give them the time of day,” he added. “I’m just lucky enough that i’ve been involved in the graffiti scene and seen it emerge. Bristol is not what it is because of me, far from it. I’m just one cog in the wheel, just like Banksy and all the others.” Check out John Nation’s Instagram, Facebook and the tour website for WhereTheWall.",police,matched,city
"BALTIMORE, Md. ― Joshua Geathers spent two exhausting years inside an Amazon warehouse complex in Southeast Baltimore. He worked first as a packer, bundling shipments to go out for delivery, and later supervised for quality control, eventually earning $14.70 an hour. The position paid better than his previous job at Staples, but he was often so drained after working that he used his paid time off just to sleep and recover. “I felt tired all the time,” said the 24-year-old Geathers, who lives within walking distance of two adjacent Amazon facilities. He found he sometimes had to run to complete his tasks on time, even though the warehouse had a strict policy against running for safety reasons.  “I’m a hardworking person, and I don’t complain about hard work,” Geathers said. “But it’s a very strenuous job.” Cities and states around the country, including Baltimore and Maryland, are now jockeying to become home to Amazon’s next headquarters, branded HQ2. Local government officials have proposed massive tax breaks for the online retailer. And the desperate bids to attract tens of thousands of tech jobs through the subsidies is giving corporate watchdogs heartburn. But Amazon has already been benefiting from public subsidies for years, in exchange for warehouse jobs like Geathers’ that pay far less than headquarter jobs. Geathers’ experience may not be what Baltimore officials had in mind when they put together a juicy package of financial incentives to lure Amazon to the area in 2013. They offered the world’s largest online retailer $43 million in tax credits, a generous public subsidy even by Amazon standards. Then-Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake boasted at the time that “one thousand jobs is nothing to sneeze at.”  Tax incentives like those in Maryland have helped fuel Amazon’s rapid growth of its distribution network. In 2015 and 2016 alone, local governments committed roughly a quarter of a billion dollars in subsidies to Amazon facilities, according to Good Jobs First, a progressive nonprofit that tracks subsidy awards. Amazon raked in another $600 million in the decade leading up to 2015, the group found. In many cases, government officials offered the tax breaks with little or no public discussion about wages or working conditions.   As the retailer expands to new areas in its effort to dominate same-day delivery, more cities and counties will have to ask themselves: How much public money is an Amazon warehouse job really worth? “The jobs Amazon creates in these warehouses are not good jobs. Even the direct hires are relatively low paid, and the work is grueling,” said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit that’s been critical of tax subsidies for large national retailers. “The notion that investing this kind of money in an Amazon warehouse is a long-term economic development strategy is really incorrect.” Amazon says its contributions to the Maryland economy are well worth the taxpayer investments. The company has put a billion dollars in its operations and now has 5,000 full-time employees in the state, according to data provided by Amazon. It recently inked a deal to open an additional Baltimore area fulfillment center, where it expects to employ another 1,500 people. The first Baltimore facility is emblematic of major shifts in the U.S. economy, as manufacturing jobs have given way to retail and service work. For seven decades the site was home to a General Motors plant, providing good-paying union jobs for the city’s working class. The last van rolled off the assembly line in 2005, when the plant closed and laid off 1,100 workers. City and state officials spent years looking for a company to breathe life into the 2.8-million square-foot site. With the rise of online retail, fulfillment centers have become a natural fit for post-industrial plants now sitting idle. The typical warehouse occupies a million square feet and employs between 1,000 and 3,000 workers. But the positions don’t necessarily have the same middle-class trappings as a GM manufacturing job. An Amazon spokesman said its fulfillment center workers receive “highly competitive wages” that pay “on average 30 percent more than traditional retail jobs,” a figure consistent with worker interviews. The average retail salesperson in the U.S. earns $10.90 per hour, according to the Labor Department, while low-level Amazon warehouse workers said they earn between $13 and $15 per hour in Maryland, where the minimum wage is $8.75.    But the work is far more physically demanding ― after all, these are warehouse jobs, not retail jobs. And in many cases, the positions still don’t pay enough to sustain a family. Of the half-dozen workers HuffPost interviewed who’d cycled through the Baltimore location, all earned wages that equated to annual salaries in the mid- to high-$20,000s. “It’s not a lot of money, but it beats McDonald’s or Wendy’s,” explained Nigel Hammett, who worked in the Baltimore facility last holiday season.  Many workers end up at Amazon fulfillment centers as temps whose jobs may end at any moment, employed by outside firms that offer lesser benefits than direct hires receive. Still, local governments find the prospect of Amazon warehouse jobs hard to resist, particularly in down-and-out neighborhoods. In the case of Baltimore, many of the city’s longtime residents have been left behind in the now-booming regional economy. The unemployment rate for African-Americans in the city is three times that of whites, and the median household income for an African-American family is around $34,000, according to one analysis. Only 13 percent of African-American adults in the city have a Bachelor’s degree or higher. Sierra Singleton wound up at the Baltimore Amazon facility in 2015 for the same reason many others do: It was the best job she could find. She was 22 at the time and had no fixed address. She was poor enough to be grateful for the free T-shirt that came with the job. She started out at $13.00 per hour, as opposed to the $8.50 of her previous job, and got 50 cents more per hour for working overnight shifts. She eventually got her own one-bedroom apartment near the fulfillment center. There were some things Singleton didn’t like about the facility. Many of the best supervisory positions seemed to go to people who weren’t from Baltimore, and the job was so taxing that she eventually had to move on after two years. “I was pushing my body past its limits,” she said. Still, she credits the company with keeping a roof over her head, and she left on good terms in November, in case she ever wants to return. Amazon’s arrival, in her estimation, has been a good thing for Southeast Baltimore. “I got a place because of this job. I could afford living somewhere outside of Section 8,” Singleton said, referring to federally subsidized housing. “Being able to pay my bills and stay above water, it was definitely because of Amazon.”  Singleton’s experience helps explain why so many cities and counties offer subsidies for Amazon warehouses: They fear much-needed jobs will go somewhere else. But critics of the tax breaks say governments are funding the demise of their own local retailers by subsidizing Amazon’s growth. They also argue that officials are giving away money in exchange for fulfillment centers that would be built in the same regions anyway, regardless of subsidies, given Amazon’s same-day delivery aspirations.  Amazon’s goal of delivering to its customers within mere hours requires more and more warehouses, and not just in the more rural, low-cost areas where it built many of its earliest. The company is bringing fulfillment jobs to dense coastal areas like Baltimore because its business plan compels it to. Greg LeRoy, the director of Good Jobs First, the nonprofit that tracks public subsidies, said local and state governments have their strategy backwards. “Amazon should be paying to arrive, not getting paid to arrive,” said LeRoy. “We’re just maddened by it.” Some of the subsidies for Amazon warehouses are less than a million dollars a piece. But in Ohio, the company netted $17 million for two facilities; in Wisconsin, $32 million for one, according to Good Jobs First. A Jacksonville, Fla., warehouse came with a total of $27 million in subsidies. The largest so far was Baltimore. Most of these subsidies come in the form of corporate income tax credits, property tax abatements, infrastructure improvements and tax increment financing.  The bulk of Amazon’s subsidies in Baltimore came as state “enterprise zone” credits reserved for investments in struggling areas. The retailer qualified for those funds by using the old GM site. Officials also provided the company with more than $1 million in loans that would be forgiven in 10 years so long as the company maintained certain staffing levels and had at least $175 million invested in the facility. There were no requirements related to wages, and officials said they weren’t especially concerned about reports out of Pennsylvania that Amazon warehouse workers were being hospitalized for heat exhaustion. A spokeswoman for Maryland’s commerce department said Amazon must provide the state with documentation on its job count at the end of each year. So far, the retailer has exceeded its obligations on the employment front, creating more jobs than required. Enrico Moretti, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said communities are playing a “zero sum game” when they compete to lure a fulfillment center to the area, since the facility is going to end up somewhere. “With the subsidies, they are essentially giving away some of the benefits that the fulfillment center would generate for the community,” he said. Still, he noted, tax breaks like the ones for Amazon in Baltimore can seem small when compared to deals for manufacturing plants, for which governments often shell out hundreds of thousands of dollars per job. That’s because the ancillary benefits of a fulfillment center can seem small, Moretti said. A major manufacturing plant could attract additional suppliers, and Amazon’s next headquarters could attract more tech companies and high-paying jobs. But “there’s not going to be a wave of tech startups because there’s an Amazon fulfillment center,” he added. Many areas have been reluctant to attach strings to their Amazon arrangements related to working conditions. An analysis done of fulfillment center deals by the Business Journals network turned up instances where officials actually waived wage requirements for Amazon that would normally apply to other corporations, just so Amazon could secure the subsidies at stake. “Their rationale, repeated by local officials interviewed by The Business Journals: Any job is better than no job,” the site reported.   Even though the subsidies are predicated on jobs, Amazon won’t always need the workers that it does now. Warehouses are becoming increasingly automated, with robots performing tasks that humans were responsible for just months ago. These advancements make warehouse work less tedious and stressful, freeing up workers to supervise machines that do the heavy lifting. But the new efficiencies also translate into fewer jobs, particularly less skilled ones.  Joshua Geathers didn’t stick around the Baltimore warehouse long enough to see robots take anybody’s job. He left Amazon last year and now works as a field technician for a data services firm, making around $9 more per hour than he did at the warehouse. He’s grateful not to be in the fulfillment center in the runup to the holidays. He found that trying to build a career there required a certain degree of desperation.  “It’s a place where one would work if they were in dire need of money,” he said. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly reported the number of full-time Amazon workers in Maryland. It is 5,000.",jobs,fear,warehouses
"On Nov. 2, New York Times columnist and noted husband of his former research assistant David Brooks graced the American reading public with his musings on the current wave of public sexual harassment allegations. Brooks’ column was quickly mocked across social media, especially his choice to dub sex “a golden nugget” and his normcore take on arousing pop songs. But what’s really odd and befuddling about his take was this blithe lede: “The world seems full of sexual predators these days.” Brooks doesn’t explain the basis for implying that there are more sexual predators today than before (in fact, even the recent accusations against film producer Harvey Weinstein and several other high-profile men span many decades), or for later asserting that the line between men seeking sexual pleasure and men preying on unwilling women is “blurrier” now than in the past. Presumably sexual harassment was easy for Brooks to ignore before the news cycle became saturated with it. In this, Brooks fell prey to the sort of ahistoricism that certainly isn’t new, but which has felt intrusively ubiquitous during this painful, exhausting year. Everything is worse than it has ever been; we have never needed salvation more than we do now. America’s standing in the world, political divisions, race relations, treatment of women ― evidence notwithstanding, mainstream discussions often take for granted that these things have never been at a lower ebb. Perhaps the most representative phrase for a year in opposing Trump is, fittingly, “Now more than ever.” Over the past 12 months, the media, institutions and public figures have worn the phrase out, leaving “now more than ever” a brittle husk, a cliché that conjures an eye roll rather than a sense of urgency.  After the election of President Donald Trump, we needed the arts now more than ever; we needed a free press now more than ever; we needed comedy now more than ever; we needed political dialogue now more than ever. Each individual cause or pursuit that seemed distasteful or trivial in the new state of political panic had to be defended, and each time the defense was the same: The very environment that makes this seem unimportant is the reason that it’s important.  By March, The Washington Post declared that “now more than ever” had to go. Of course, since then, we’ve found that we need robust missile defense, immigrant workers and young people voting in local elections ― now, more than ever. “Now more than ever” leverages the weight of history while simultaneously turning away from it. To say that we have never been in such dire straits is a powerful statement because history is long and full of dire straits ― plagues, genocides, wars ― and yet now is somehow worse. But that assertion only holds up as long as one doesn’t actually look back on those plagues, genocides and wars. We can say that America is in the lowest place we can remember, but it likely requires us to forget or downplay events in our own lifetimes, from the Jim Crow era to the September 11 attacks. We can imagine that sexual harassment is a new problem, but that requires us to ignore the Anita Hill hearings, the accusations against Bill Clinton and, frankly, the entire history of men having power over women. This attitude is somehow both nerve-jangling and soothing. It’s like declaring bankruptcy: A painful road lies ahead, but you have permission to forget about any embarrassingly awful turns you made to arrive here. Shocked Trump was elected? Surprised about the sexual harassment faced by all your female colleagues? Blindsided by the rise of the white nationalist movement? Don’t waste time grappling with the fact that you didn’t bother to vote, or sat silently when your male coworkers made sexist jokes, or ignored the targeted aggression faced by black women online in recent years. Focus on the particularly fierce urgency of now.   Both Trump’s slogan, “Make America Great Again,” and the rallying retort from his opponents, “America Is Already Great,” traffic in this sort of convenient amnesia: Either way, America starts from a base point of greatness. Either way, its ugly roots in mass genocide, human trafficking and forced labor have been swept aside. The winners write the history books, and in America the winners have always been white men. Even when human rights for the oppressed have triumphed, powerful white men on both sides have been motivated to minimize the past injustices and to glorify their own roles. Many of the narratives now accepted as common wisdom were composed with a power-consolidating agenda. These narratives demonize or ignore people of color; they sow distrust of women’s words.   With the racist backlash to the election of President Barack Obama, followed by the election of Trump, who has used rhetoric favored by white nationalists, white Americans have been confronted with a racial divide in the country that our national mythologists had been working for centuries to paper over. It seems worse now than ever; it’s not. Before, though, the suffering of people of color, and especially black people, was submerged beneath our self-congratulatory national narratives. Men have been similarly blindsided by the recent wave of sexual assault and harassment allegations against industry leaders ― or, at least, blindsided that anyone cares. Brooks isn’t the only one to wax astonished at this new wave of sexual misconduct. But the crimes existed before this month, and the perpetrators were enabled and protected by willful ignorance and anti-feminist cultural narratives.  “This tsunami of stories doesn’t just reveal the way that men have grabbed and rubbed and punished and shamed women; it shows us that they did it all while building the very world in which we still have to live,” wrote Rebecca Traister last month. She noted, in particular, the spate of sexual harassment allegations against political reporter Mark Halperin ― a man whose book, Game Change, largely defined the narrative of the 2008 election.  “The same power that afforded Halperin the ability to allegedly rub up against younger colleagues,” wrote Traister, “also meant that he got to shape the nation’s view of a woman whose political story had already been shaped by other men who abused their power.” His take on Hillary Clinton, she pointed out, was a harsh, nuance-free portrait of “a grasping and scandal-plagued woman.” His coverage of Trump, in the 2016 election, was relatively flattering. He downplayed sexual harassment claims against Trump; now the public has learned that Halperin behaved similarly with younger female colleagues. Halperin’s power to shape political narratives has taken a severe hit. A planned book on Trump’s campaign was scuttled by Penguin following the allegations, and HBO dropped a planned movie based on the book. But, as Traister notes, we still have to live with the narratives he propagated. Consider the 2016 Democratic primary. Even as the party is undoubtedly divided and in disarray, postmortems are met with annoyance and outrage from whichever group was satisfied with existing narratives. When Bernie Sanders supporters spent the weeks after the election chorusing, “Bernie would have won,” centrist Democrats were dismissive. When Clinton came out with a book about her 2016 campaign, critics across the political spectrum sniped that she needed to go away and be quiet rather than pick at the party’s wounds. This is framed as a call to “move on” or to “look ahead,” and can be directed at anyone, on any side of the divide, who wants to re-litigate an aspect of the primary. But perpetually looking ahead, or ― still worse ― looking only at the present moment, only ensures that we will continue to live with damagingly false ideas about our past.  And, as William Faulkner wrote, the past is never past. We continue to live within societies and institutions shaped by what has happened to us. In 2014, Ta-Nehisi Coates published a powerful case for reparations in The Atlantic. “Won’t reparations divide us?” he wrote. “Not any more than we are already divided. The wealth gap merely puts a number on something we feel but cannot say ― that American prosperity was ill-gotten and selective in its distribution. What is needed is an airing of family secrets, a settling with old ghosts.” Until we fully reckon with the crimes of America’s history, and reconstruct a national identity that incorporates a full understanding of them, he argues, those crimes continue to reverberate throughout our society.  “Now more than ever” and its attendant naïf posture about the longstanding ills of American culture and politics are paper over the cracks in our foundations. They’re stories we tell ourselves to explain away the damage we’ve found as a surface flaw. But fixing our country requires more than excuses and misdirection. Now, as ever, it requires us to look fearlessly into our past and be honest about what we see there.",he,have,narratives
"At the tail end of last year, the New York book community was hit with unsettling news. BookCourt, the independently run store serving Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Brooklyn Heights, and readers willing to venture from their own neighborhoods for the sake of author events and stocked shelves, was closing. For avid readers, the loss of a bookstore leaves a mark. Bookstores ― the brick-and-mortar variety ― foster so many chance encounters and reflective moments; true love of the glue-and-paper sort blossoms among their shelves. And, a shuttered indie doesn’t bode so well for the looming Bezospocalypse, even if their sales are increasing at a steadier-than-average clip compared with non-indie vendors.  But, like magic, the closing of BookCourt coincided with the announcement of another store, to be opened by Emma Straub, author of Modern Lovers, The Vacationers and Laura Lamont’s Life in Pictures. A onetime BookCourt employee and longtime lover of literature, Straub hopes her store will be “salve for the wound.” She and her husband are still ironing out the details of the lease for their store, Books Are Magic! But, she told The Huffington Post that they’re aiming for a May opening date. “I understand from all of my friends who own small businesses that things always take longer than you think they should,” Staub said. “But, we’ll see. The goal is May.” Below, Straub shares her earliest and happiest bookstore memories, and her and her husband’s plans for their future store. When did you decide to open Books Are Magic!? The second that we heard that BookCourt was closing. Which was mid-October. We found out earlier than most of the public in the neighborhood. Immediately, we thought, no, no, this can’t happen. We live a few blocks away from BookCourt, and we’re there, I would say, three or four times a week. I truly couldn’t fathom the notion that we would live in a neighborhood without an independent bookstore. We know ― oh, yeah, this is our job to fix. So, we’re working on it. In your announcement you highlight the importance of a bookstore to a community or neighborhood. How, in your experience, have bookstores played that role?  I work from home, and for me a bookstore is a place that I can always go. It’s a place I can go to find new ideas, and see old friends, and to read a poem, and to pick up a picture book for one of my children, and to buy a gift. Books are the only presents that always fit. I don’t think I’ve ever gotten a book and thought, oh, god, this is just, the wrong thing. Even when I don’t buy something, I always fondle a lot of things. As a writer, bookstores have been enormously important to me. BookCourt in particular, but also other independent bookstores across the country. There’s nothing like it. There’s nothing like a bookstore. It falls in a certain in-between space, between public space and private space. Bookstores always feel intimate but welcoming. I think they’re important and necessary for people like me who have small children, and where it’s not always warm outside. It’s nice to have a place to go. You’ve already touched on this, but what do you think physical bookstores offer that, say, an online bookstore doesn’t? Oh, discoverability. Discoverability, expertise. I think algorithms are great, and sometimes helpful when you’re buying something and it suggests that you also buy batteries or whatever, but it doesn’t really work with books. It really doesn’t. An algorithm is never going to replace a human being saying, “Oh, that’s interesting, you like Ann Patchett and Meg Wolitzer but you’ve never read Maile Meloy? Oh my god, you’re in for such a treat!” There are so many things like that that happen every day in every bookstore. Also, just the feeling of wandering. Actually, I have this problem a lot when it comes to music. I don’t listen to CDs anymore, because my husband is more technologically advanced than I am. He has his music very well organized, and on his cloud-whatever, but I no longer get to flip through my music to see what I have. I’ve forgotten what I like to listen to. I can’t remember anything if I can’t see it. And that’s how I feel about bookstores. When you walk through a bookstore, you’re reminded of things that you love, and you see a cover that looks amazing, of a book you’ve never heard of by a person you’ve never heard of, and you pick it up and you flip it over and you read what it’s about and maybe you buy it. And that doesn’t really happen online. You can’t just fall into something. You can’t pick a book off the shelf and read the first five pages of it and know that you’re going to fall in love. Or, you can’t pick up a book that everyone else has read and loved, and read the first page and know that it’s garbage and that you don’t want to read it. You worked at BookCourt. What do you hope to emulate about that store, with your store? And is there anything you’d like to change, or anything new you’d like to try? What’s most important to me is to have a space that feels open and welcoming, and comfortable. That’s the number-one thing. I think BookCourt did a really beautiful job for 35 years, and I hope to be half as good at it as they were. Luckily I have a lot of friends who run independent bookstores in New York City. In fact, everyone who runs a bookstore in New York City has been so friendly and encouraging to us about this. Christine Onorati, who owns WORD, is one of my dearest friends. Stephanie Valdez and Ezra at the Community Bookstore, Rebecca and Jessica at Greenlight, Maggie Pounzie at Story, a children’s bookstore. Sarah McNally. Every person has been encouraging, and offered their help and expertise. We really feel like we’re not trying to compete with anyone. We are truly just doing this to fill this hole in this neighborhood where we live, that has been served so beautifully by BookCourt for so long. We’re just trying to be a little salve for the wound.  Where did you come up with the store’s name, Books Are Magic!? We hadn’t really thought about names very much. We had a few that sounded more like a butcher shop. We were struggling a little bit. And then, we were talking about just doing a children’s bookstore. And I just thought, books are magic. Just, books are magic, that’s it, that’s the whole point. And we decided that books are magic for everyone, not just children. What’s your earliest bookstore memory? My earliest bookstore memory is from when I was about 10 years old, and I grew up on the Upper West Side in Manhattan where there used to be this wonderful independent bookstore called Endicot. And Matt Dillon was in the store when I was in the store, and I just followed him around. It was not a big place, and I was not a small 10-year-old, so I doubt I was very inconspicuous. So that’s my earliest bookstore memory, if I’m being 100 percent honest. So, it started with a dreamboat. Working at BookCourt was one of the best jobs I’ve ever had. I think what made it so fun for me was that I knew every day I went in there I was going to have conversations with smart, interesting people. That is, the other booksellers, the owners, and the customers. That’s what I really loved about it. There was always someone to talk to, and they always had something to say about a book.

"This Article is Co-Authored by Samier Mansur and Meera Seshadri From the media highrises of New York City to the studios of Hollywood and the tech corridors of Silicon Valley, the past few months have revealed the ugly extent to which sexual harassment and assault plagues America’s workplaces. The Fox Networks, Ubers, and Harvey Weinsteins of the corporate world tell a story that is all too familiar: People in positions of power who take advantage of vulnerable employees; the company cover up to protect the harasser and its reputation; and retaliations against those who come forward or speak out. Transparency and accountability are values that promote employee morale and productivity, and are ultimately good for business. However, as the recent online #MeToo revelations have shown around the world, people are paying the high mental, emotional, and financial price for a corporate culture built on silence, retribution, and lack of accountability. What does it say about our culture when 70 percent of those harassed across the workforce are too afraid to speak up? Or when 75 percent of people who experience harm are brave enough to come forward and are then subject to retaliation? For too long, this culture has undermined and marginalized its workforce by putting the reputation of the company above every employee’s basic human right to dignity, respect. The revelations over the past year highlight two truths: 1) What we’ve seen in the media is just the tip of a far-reaching and systemic culture of tolerance for sexual harassment and assault that spans virtually every industry; and 2) at a time when corporate culture is directly tied to brand value, companies that continue to airbrush allegations out of their books are in for a rude awakening. The cost of a short-sighted culture of silence and behind-closed-door settlements are among the highest in the corporate world. For example, sexual harassment and assault cases have cost 21st Century Fox $110 million in settlements alone, in addition to missed quarterly revenue earnings. Uber’s hit from this year’s highly public harassment claims has been estimated to be as high as $18 billion in market valuation following a company-wide staff and leadership overhaul and diminished brand perception. The company also saw an astounding decline in talent ― female engineers decreased from 25 percent to six percent over the period of allegations. As for Harvey Weinstein, his career in the industry is effectively over; and the remaining staff at his fledgling company have collectively penned a letter calling for “radical transparency and accountability” if the company is to survive with them in it. Employees expect better from their employers by way of culture, and the status quo is not sustainable. With over 50 percent of sexual harassment in the workplace coming from those in positions of power, meaningful solutions will require concerted, strategic, and sustained reinforcement from the leadership. They need to go beyond the one-time harassment training modules that 90% of large companies offer — and which multiple studies (including a comprehensive study on harassment in the workforce conducted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2016) have demonstrated to have little to no effect. To repeat the same thing and expect different results doesn’t work - and so many leaders at this time have questioned what to do. The following five actionable steps are designed to help build a culture of transparency, accountability, and sensitivity on the issue of sexual harassment and assault in the workplace: 1. Hold a team meeting to let your employees know you have their back  A powerful way for a company or team leader to send a strong message is to hold an all-hands meeting where s/he offers their support should anyone in their team feel threatened, demeaned, or made to feel uncomfortable in the course of their duties. Jessica Carson, an Associate Director at a prominent mental health association wrote about this recently, “I know it may seem ‘obvious...’” she began, “But it’s not. No matter how ‘open’ you are with your employees, it’s NOT their default state to talk to you about sex, flirtation, and unwanted advances. YOU need to open that space. YOU need to make it explicitly clear that they will be heard... Feeling protected in that safe space is one of the best examples of leadership one can experience.” This meeting should strongly emphasize: i) sexual harassment and assault are criminal offenses; ii) no one, regardless of rank, or how much they contribute to the bottom line is above the company’s commitment to the rights and wellbeing of its employees; iii) there is a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to illegal harassment and discrimination in any form; and d) the organization has a plan to address these issues. 2. Create a shared definition of what constitutes harassment  Studies show that when acts of harassment are “specifically defined”, more people report incidents. Developing a shared definition of what constitutes sexual harassment, assault, or harm ― with clear examples of what people may experience in the workplace ― comes with two important benefits: first, employees are better able to recognize and report workplace infractions; and second, employees feel greater representation and ownership over a company culture and policies they helped shape. Any shared definition of harm should represent the plurality of identities and experiences within the company. For instance, minorities face sexual harassment at higher rates than their counterparts, and a staggering 90% of trans-identified workers report some form of harassment or mistreatment in the workplace. When people of all genders, sexual orientations, and ethnicities see themselves represented in leadership, policy, and protocol, they are more likely to share their experiences and ideas on how the company culture can improve. 3. Establish an effective confidential reporting system  Trauma affects each individual differently, and this nuance matters. There is a reason why sexual harassment and assault are among the most underreported workplace violations. No matter how open and receptive the company, manager, or even HR may be, these are sensitive issues that can benefit from trauma informed approaches to reporting that prioritizes confidentiality. The following strategies can encourage an atmosphere in which employees feel more comfortable to disclose and report: i) employees know exactly where their report is going (and by whom it’s being received); ii) their claim is taken seriously and supported; iii) their report is completely confidential (until otherwise directed by the person who made the report); and iv) the report is followed through on, with the claimant kept informed of the process at every step. This process can help encourage reporting, and provide much-needed support in what can be an overwhelming emotional ordeal for the person who experienced harm. 4. Create shared accountability: Culture in action For a culture to work, it must be lived in the daily experiences and interactions within a community. Holding every individual accountable ― from the top down ― to the company’s shared definition of harm requires taking into account structures of power and status.There will be times when a colleague witnesses behavior that constitutes harassment, or an employee confides in their colleague about a harmful experience they had with another co-worker. In such situations, it’s important to establish an environment where every member of the organization feels supported in calling out the harmful behavior of another ― be they a colleague, manager, or an executive. Employees who are encouraged to keep an eye out for one another, and are trained in how to sensitively and appropriately respond to a disclosure, become a part of the solution. Their efforts are strengthened by managers and executives who support and endorse trauma-informed policies and processes. Working in collaboration, this network effect helps: i) engender trust in the new system; ii) normalize the act of checking in on someone; and iii) create safer and more equitable spaces where people feel supported in coming forward to address harmful attitudes and actions. 5. Create lasting cultural impact  As we have seen, it is not sufficient to have one board meeting or training session to announce a zero tolerance policy against sexual harassment. Setting the tone at the top is one thing; keeping it pitch perfect as it resonates through the organization is another. Below are three ways to ensure the longevity of a company’s efforts to address these issues and facilitate meaningful culture change: Sexual harassment and assault are an epidemic in our workplaces. It is better to get ahead of the issue than pay the reactive costs of looking the other way. As innumerable recent examples have demonstrated, the human and financial toll it takes is too steep and devastating for any organization to delay prioritizing its prevention. Taken together, these five steps go beyond the minimum strategic defense against future lawsuits. More importantly, they are an opportunity to help build an organizational culture that fosters respect, transparency, and accountability. This cultural evolution ultimately inspires trust and loyalty at every level, attracts and retains talent, and builds a resilient and successful brand from the inside out. Now that’s an investment worth making. Appendix: Thinking more broadly about the issue:",Holding,requires,power
"Ashton Kutcher certainly means well, but his recent attempt to talk about gender equality at work didn’t go quite as the 39-year-old actor and investor likely hoped. Kutcher, who’s made a name for himself in the elite, male-dominated world of venture capital investing, announced Thursday on LinkedIn that he and his partner at the VC firm he founded, Sound Ventures, plan to host an “open dialogue” on gender equality in the workplace and the tech industry. So far, so good. Unfortunately, Kutcher then added a list of questions that inadvertently illustrate why it’s so difficult to achieve gender equality in the workplace. “This is grossly offensive,” one marketing manager commented in response. Many of the questions make certain assumptions about women that are grounded in stereotypes, including the misguided notions that women somehow have sub-par business ideas and that the only reason there aren’t more females in tech is because they’re not interested in the subject matter. Yikes. These are definitely *not* the right questions. Most rely on flawed assumptions and perpetuate problematic myths. pic.twitter.com/vUF1CVBcOt “Should investors invest in ideas that they believe to have less merit so as to create equality across a portfolio?” Kutcher asks. The question operates off the misguided notion that women have sub-par business ideas. Instead, what often happens is that men are more receptive to ideas from other men. Or, male investors simply don’t understand the idea a woman is pitching. There were almost zero men, for example, willing to back Sara Blakely, who founded Spanx. When Blakely was starting out, dudes just didn’t get why women would need those kinds of undergarments. Blakely is now worth about $1 billion. Kutcher’s first question, though, is a doozy: “What are the Rules for dating in the workplace? Flirting? What are the clear red lines?” he wonders. This simply should not be the first question on such an important issue as bringing more diverse entrepreneurs into a key part of the economy. It also fails to recognize that sexual harassment is a power issue ― not a dating issue. “The question ‘What are the clear red lines?’ is less about supporting gender equality, and more about protecting powerful men from accusations of sexual harassment or misconduct,” writes Mashable’s Emma Hinchliffe. Kutcher also wonders, “Given that in the short term we are clearly bound by the existing educated talent pool in STEM, other than promoting STEM education parity going forward, how do we stop gap a solution?” It’s true that fewer women than men go into the STEM (science, tech, engineering, math) fields. But this is hardly the driving reason behind a lack of women in tech. A big problem: Women leave the industry at higher rates than men because of a hostile work environment. The stuff suggesting women's under-representation has only to do with the educational pipeline: not accurate. Kutcher’s efforts come at a time of massive turmoil over sexual harassment in tech and the VC world in particular. Last month, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick was forced to resign from the ride-hailing company after revelations about a broken work culture. The issue ignited in the VC world about a week ago, when more than two dozen women in tech came forward in a New York Times article about the harassment they’ve experienced in the startup world, many as entrepreneurs trying to get funding. Two very well-known investors were named.  That story followed another report in which six women alleged a venture capitalist had made unwanted advances toward them. Since then, prominent investor Dave McClure has been forced to resign from his firm. And the tech world has taken to Medium, Twitter and elsewhere to offer up excuses, explanations and strategies to fix the problem. Though the VC world is small, it has massive ripple effects. VC funding helps drive some of the most valuable and “hottest” tech companies in the country. Kutcher himself has made investments in Twitter, Foursquare and Uber.  The tone-deaf nature of Kutcher’s questions echoes comments he made earlier this year about Kalanick, a friend of his. The actor/investor said he felt “conflicted” over the Uber controversy and seemed to defend his friend’s behavior, though he admitted he wasn’t really familiar with the details.  Susan Fowler, the former Uber engineer who started a firestorm in February by writing a blog post about her experience at the company, made that point on Friday afternoon.  He appears to think uber did nothing wrong in my situation as well. Maybe not the best person to talk about gender equality issues... Joelle Emerson, the founder and CEO of Paradigm, which works with tech companies like Pinterest on reducing bias and increasing diversity, was quick to note on Twitter how misguided Kutcher’s questions were. She took a lot of flack ― mostly from men ― for criticizing the star. “Put examples of the right ?s out there or stop with the dumb comments,” one man tweeted. Nevertheless, she persisted. Alright, here are 10 better questions to be asking about gender equality in the workplace and in tech specifically: https://t.co/Sq33UX4ZCc On Friday, Emerson posted an alternative list of questions, grounded in her research and work on this issue. They include: How can VC firms and early stage companies reach beyond our own homogenous networks to find the best people and ideas? In other words, let’s find some good strategies to bring in more women. What are the key data points VC firms and companies should be tracking to identify bias and discrimination in their organizations? Meaning, you can’t fix a problem if you haven’t appropriately figured out its scope. What can VC firms do to play a more active role in retaining women, given that we know this is so much more than an educational pipeline problem? Another words, are companies doing all they can to make their firm a place where everyone feels invested. At the end of his LinkedIn post, Kutcher asks earnestly if his questions are the right ones. Kutcher has demonstrated in the past that he supports equality and understands bias ― supporting co-star Natalie Portman’s efforts to get paid fairly and wife Mila Kunis’ posts on equality. He even launched a petition to get diaper-changing stations in men’s rooms. On Friday evening, Kutcher thanked Emerson for the feedback. Thanks for your great feedback.",woman,understand,idea
"This week, Cardinal George Pell, a high-ranking Vatican official, was summoned to his native Australia to face criminal charges for what was termed “historical child abuse.”  The police have not disclosed any details about the abuse or when it occurred. But a recent book recounted the story of an altar boy who came forward to charge abuse in 2014. The alleged incident took place sometime between 1996 and 2001. That would mean that at least 13 years elapsed before a victim came forward. Reportedly, he did so after the suicide of a fellow former altar boy. We don’t know whether Pell is guilty. He has denied all allegations of abuse. But what we do know is that if the alleged victim had lived in New York, he likely would have had been denied any access to justice. That’s because New York has some of the highest hurdles in the nation for the victims of sexual abuse that occurred when they were children. New York only gives these victims five years after turning 18 to seek civil or criminal redress. That’s not long enough. Child victims take years, sometimes decades, to truly process what happened to them, and then to summon up the courage to ask for criminal or civil redress. Advocates for victims have been struggling for more than a decade to persuade New York lawmakers to pass a law that would give victims more time to seek justice. The reformers backed a proposal to essentially eliminate the deadline for child sexual abuse complaints in the future, and to give victims of child abuse in the past a one-year window to file complaints. This year, lawmakers in the Democratic-controlled Assembly and Gov. Andrew Cuomo both backed a more modest bill that would have permitted victims until age 28 to file criminal complaints of past sexual abuse, but would have permitted victims to file civil suits until they turned 50. The bill also kept the one-year window for past victims to file suit. But even that modest proposal was blocked by the leader of the Republican State Senate, who refused to even bring the measure up for a vote before the legislature adjourned at the end of June. When the State Senate balked, Cuomo appeared reluctant to spend political capital to change the outcome. Advocates have blamed the intense opposition of the Catholic Church. The church reportedly has spent more than $2 million lobbying to block the bill. What happened in New York is not unique. Catholic bishops often strongly oppose this type of legislation. And the fight is generally over the same issues. Faced with the potential onslaught of victims, church officials contend that these laws would harm innocent priests because of false accusations and would cost the church millions in litigation. But supporters counter that there is little evidence that extending deadlines results in frivolous claims.They also point out that victims still have to convince prosecutors, judges and juries that such abuse occurred. On one point, the bishops are right. If past victims receive access to justice, the church likely will face many more lawsuits. Indeed, New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan conceded as much when he mortgaged the church’s pricey Manhattan real estate to create a $100 million victims fund. Dolan seems to be willing to spend this much to control the process and tamp down the bad publicity. The compensation fund is similar to funds paying damages to the victims of mass terror like the 9/11 or the Boston Marathon attacks. Yes, victims will receive compensation, but they also must promise never to sue and to comply with privacy and confidentiality requirements. The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP) has charged that the fund is tantamount to “hush money” if the archdiocese fails to publicly disclose the names of abusers and ensure that crimes are reported to the authorities, and does not makes it files on accused priests available to Kenneth Feinberg, who is administering the fund. The fund also does not cover victims of clergy who are members of religious orders, even though they work with the approval of the diocese. That would exclude abuse by nearly 80 percent of the priests, religious and deacons in New York. Nevertheless, the program’s first phase, open to those with documented claims of past abuse, drew 142 victims. In its second phase, the fund will consider claims by new victims. Its existence offers some insight into the clergy’s motives when they so ardently block laws to give victims more time to seek justice. It’s not mainly about the money, although that certainly is a big factor. It’s the scandal. The institutional church is so concerned about its reputation that when Detroit Auxiliary Bishop Thomas Gumbleton, himself a victim of abuse, was willing to testify in support of extending the statute of limitations for abuse victims in Ohio, the Vatican quickly punished him. His crime? Publicly disagreeing with Ohio bishops, who strongly opposed the reform bill. The only way to deal with the scandals and the lawsuits is to better protect the children in the church’s care. And that means flushing out all the abusers, past and present, and addressing abuse complaints as transparently as possible. It means that church leaders must finally realize that the reputation of the institutional church should not be their highest priority. The church’s reputation will only improve until and unless Pope Francis, cardinals and bishops address this problem fully and directly. Church leaders fight stronger laws, but these laws are not their enemy. Sooner or later, church officials will have to face up to the fundamental problem. It is staring them in the mirror.

"So, if you're a big fan of Gary V or Grant Cardone you know that they're always talking about the hustle. That you should work your butt of 24/7 nonstop every single day. 
Here's the problem with that...many people hustle but they hustle on the wrong things. An example of that is when someone is trying to lose weight. They can hustle and go to the gym regularly but if they eat wrong - it doesn't work out too well. Now let's be completely real here. I'm not saying don't hustle. I'm saying don't hustle for the sake of hustling because you think that's how you're going to make it. That is the old way of thinking. Here's why, I recently found an entrepreneur named Christopher Duncan. He's a multiple 7 figure business owner, best-selling author with 8 companies, over 40 staff members, and a huge podcast. The man is amazing. But what intrigued me more is what he lives by. He lives by the slogan ""Total Freedom"".  He has a business that works for him even when he doesn't. There will be times when he wakes up and goes to the beach because he feels like it. He can come home, crush a webinar and be good in his business. He's able to live which is what everyone should be doing. I interviewed him recently to figure out why there's this notion that entrepreneurs need to hustle to make it. The very first thing I learned with Chris is that he makes it specifically clear that life is more important than hustle. As an entrepreneur, I agree 100% because even though I love working - the moments that really stick with me are the moments that I have with my parents, friends and going on adventures.  When you're lost in the hustle you forget what life is all about. I'm going to teach you something he taught me during the conversation.  The first question I want you to ask yourself is this: would you do the work for free? Most likely the answer you chose is no. You're either doing the work you're doing because you need money or it pays you well. If you're doing it for money than you are essentially trading your life for money. If you're ok with that, let me put it into more perspective.  Imagine the person you care about the most in this world. Would you sell their life for money? If you're answer is no. Then why are you doing it for yours? That's the entire point. Your time is your life. You're trading your life for money. You're missing out on having a relationship with your parents, children, friends. Potentially missing out on birthdays, experiencing new adventures and experiencing this miracle we call life. Hustle is the old way of thinking. It's a job mindset and sales mindset. In the new era of technology, you no longer need to work your butt off to make it. You can work smarter. The hustle mentality also sets you up for living later...but later never comes. You're hustling now so you can live your life later but what if you die tomorrow? You've got to learn how to live life in the moment and still work towards the future.  You see, if you just knew the needle movers in your business - the small things that make all the difference. You can just do that. This is where the 80/20 rule comes in. People are hustling and they're doing the 80% of the things that don't even matter as much. If you were focused on the 20%, there wouldn't need to be a lot of hustle. There could be more delegation.  So now the question becomes what is the 20%. The truth is that it's different for everyone because it depends where they want to go. But generally, Chris says it's cashflow. Making sure the money coming in is more than the money going out. Making sales and increasing cashflow. The next thing would be to delegate the tasks in your business so that you can focus on what makes you happy.  Here's a prime example of what I'm talking about. I screenshotted a status that I saw on Facebook the other day it represents the 80/20 rule perfectly while shining light on the 80% that doesn't even matter.   Notice the difference? He was hustling a lot before but getting little to no results. Now he gets to live life while making more money.  Society has conditioned us to think we should work for 8 hours in a job. But what if the job gets done in 2 hours? The hustle is based on a non-outcome driven society. Where people think, they need to constantly hustle which is why one of the reasons entrepreneurs always say ""we don't have time"". But when you become productive instead of busy you can't give yourself that excuse.  So instead of having the mentality of needing to ""hustle"", you should be thinking in terms of productivity because that's the correct message. The message isn't hustle. The message is productivity.",You,do,that
"Hopefully, most of us are not daily sparring with co-workers behaving similarly to the fired Google employee James Damore who recently unleashed a 10-page anti-diversity, gender-bashing manifesto. The fallout and his threat of legal recourse has prompted conversations, backlash, anger on all sides, action and perhaps new policies about unconscious bias, gender bias, the gender gap, gender parity and discrimination. Yet such gender stereotyping, blaming and pushback against women in tech, STEM and the C-Suite is not an anomaly. Nor is it new. Lawrence Summers, then-president of Harvard University, in 2005 proclaimed, “...one reason there are relatively few women in top positions in science may be ‘issues of intrinsic aptitude.’” That was 12 years ago when the 28-year-old fired Google engineer and author of the memo, “Google’s Ideological Echo Chamber,” was just 16. The response immediately from on high this past week at Google was swift. CEO Sundar Pichai fired the employee for violating the Google Code of Conduct for “advancing harmful gender stereotypes” in the workplace. In his memo to employees, Pichai wrote: “It is contrary to our basic values and our Code of Conduct, which expects ‘each Googler to do their utmost to create a workplace culture that is free of harassment, intimidation, bias and unlawful discrimination.’” CNN’s Sara Ashley O’Brien commented that Pichai wrote, “To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK.” Still, a planned company-wide Town Hall to address the memo was cancelled after female employees were targeted personally on social media. Susan Wojcicki, the highest ranking female Google employee as CEO of YouTube, in a Fortune essay writes of responding to her daughter that women are not biologically inept. “That question, whether it’s been asked outright, whispered quietly, or simply lingered in the back of someone’s mind, has weighed heavily on me throughout my career in technology,” Wojcicki writes. Danielle Brown, Google’s new VP of diversity, integrity and governance, wrote an internal memo explaining her views, according to Kara Swisher at Recode.  Brown writes: “Google has taken a strong stand on this issue, by releasing its demographic data and creating a company-wide OKR on diversity and inclusion. Strong stands elicit strong reactions. Changing a culture is hard, and it’s often uncomfortable.” The official responses referring to policy, reminding employees of a code of conduct, modeling behavior and offering a thoughtful personal response are welcomed. But what action is possible on an individual level? How do you handle a co-worker with gender bias who may act out in a way that makes you uncomfortable? Here are some tips on handling and perhaps rectifying a work culture where you may feel under attack due to gender bias because of who you are and perhaps what others feel you ideologically represent as a woman. Never respond in kind. If you are a recipient of an email, memo, text or post that lashes out and is negative, personal, discriminatory and accusatory, resist the urge to respond with emotion. Document the communication, take screenshots of a Twitter conversation, print out the email, put the memo or the document in a separate digital folder. You will want to report all communication of this kind to your supervisor. Also refrain from talking about this to your peers in the office. You do not want this to escalate. Know that communicating in a way that can be considered harassment is illegal. The U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission defines harassment this way: “To be unlawful, the conduct must create a work environment that would be intimidating, hostile, or offensive to reasonable people. Offensive conduct may include, but is not limited to, offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, physical assaults or threats, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, offensive objects or pictures, and interference with work performance. Harassment can occur in a variety of circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following: The harasser can be the victim’s supervisor, a supervisor in another area, an agent of the employer, a co-worker, or a non-employee. The victim does not have to be the person harassed, but can be anyone affected by the offensive conduct. Unlawful harassment may occur without economic injury to, or discharge of, the victim.” Organize a company-wide discussion of positive tactics for a culture shift. Be careful, sensitive and not knee-jerk in your approach. But do this swiftly within a week or two of the recent event so it is still fresh and not forgotten. Do not concentrate on the single incident, but plan a discussion around solutions for gender bias and discriminatory behavior. Organize a panel with experts and perhaps prep the participants with a reading list. To that end, the 9 Leadership Power Tools created by Gloria Feldt, co-founder and president of Take The Lead, offer Power Tool # 2, “Define Your Own Terms—First, Before Anyone Else Does.” Feldt explains, “Whoever sets the terms of the debate usually wins. By redefining power not as ‘power over,’ but as ‘power to,’ we shift from a culture of oppression to a culture of positive intention to make things better for everyone.” As leadership expert Margaret Wheatley says, “Be brave enough to have a conversation that matters.” For instance, planned long before this Google eruption, in Cleveland this week, Startup Scaleup, JumpStart’s all-day networking and expertise-sharing event for entrepreneurs and small businesses, has a panel specifically addressing the challenges of being a woman in the startup world, according to The Plain Dealer. Fedlt counsels, “Frame the discussion in such a way that it’s not a complaint session, but a genuine opportunity to state their concerns forthrightly and leave with an action plan to address them. Moments of controversy are the best times to make progress because people are paying attention.” Answer with facts and evidence. If a coworker pontificates about gender stereotypes and offers what he or she considers to be facts, be sure that you have even more abundant, recent, accurate evidence, studies and research that counter the claim. One of the best ways to bolster your argument, according to The OpEd Project, is to “acknowledge and dismiss” the evidence of the other side with irrefutable information. What that means is when a person mentions unattributed, vague research without naming it specifically, be sure you have multiple, specific and accessible sources at the ready as a rebuttal. Offer to send links to the research. Assume the person is unaware, not intentionally malicious. You can word it with, “That is very interesting, but the most recent research has debunked that theory. I am happy to send it to you.” Be clear on boundaries and rules of engagement. If your company or organization does not have a manual or code of conduct as it relates to gender bias, ask to help create one. And be sure that you are respectful in all communications with your peers and colleagues. If there is a code of conduct, know it and follow it. “It’s fine to provide a space for respectful discourse and disagreement, but the line is crossed when bias views are espoused that can lead to very real career stagnation, derailment, and disparate impact with no consequences. This means companies need real policies, and enforcement, for offensive behavior, so as not to be a rest haven for prejudice. A company won’t achieve the desired outcome as long as it employs those that actively resent and work against diversity and inclusion,” Bari Williams, attorney and business operations executive at StubHub, writes in Huffington Post. Do not make this “us against them.” It would be easy for the perhaps smaller group of women in the organization to band together against men who may project gender bias. Instead, make an effort to include men in conversations of bias. Amber Madison writes in Fast Company: “Traditional norms of masculinity come along with a great deal of power and privilege. But adherence to these norms is also associated with health issues, social isolation, and loneliness. Helping men challenge and examine the biases and stereotypes that directly concern them, too, is one way to bring them in on conversations about biases and stereotypes that concern others. It may also make them feel less defensive and threatened, and make clear that when it comes to bias, we all have skin in the game. We know–from an abundance of research–that diverse and inclusive companies do better, and are better places to work. The more people we can get on board with that reality, the more realistic it is to think that we can create workplaces that are truly diverse and inclusive.” Contribute to and help create a culture where words and communication tone matter. “You have to be totally intentional about making people aware of how they sound and the way they’re behaving and the way they use words,” Ken Ziegler, CEO of cloud-computing company LogicWorks, tells Business Insider. “The majority of the folks can be trained and sensitized and they can learn from it. It’s a learning opportunity.” Understand that you have the power to make a cultural change in your organization, acting on the individual as well as the organizational level. Yes, you could always quit and try to find another job if the company culture becomes unbearable. Optimally, you can work in a culture where you are valued and where the leadership understands that a diverse culture is smarter, more productive and more profitable. “One of the best ways to boost their capacity to transform themselves and their products may involve hiring more women and culturally diverse team members, research suggests. In a study published in Innovation: Management, Policy & Practice, they found that companies with more women were more likely to introduce radical new innovations into the market over a two-year period,” according to The Harvard Business Review. Actively working toward gender parity in all forms of leadership across all sectors is a goal of Take The Lead by 2025. This recent Google episode punctuates the urgency of that challenge. “The worst of the Google rant was his underlying belief that women are biologically unfit to work in tech. If any part of your leadership shares this mindset, please bring in some expertise to educate them (you),” writes Annie Feighery , CEO & co-founder of @mWaterCo. in Medium. “Socializing and cultural norms gave rise to these notions and they are the poison seed that threatens to destroy all that is beautiful about Web 2.0, Silicon Valley, the idea economy, and the future as we dream it to be.” This post originally ran in Take The Lead’s Movement Blog. Take The Lead offers a full range of ready-to-use leadership training solutions, proven to make the breakthrough difference in any career trajectory and create results, whether you’re an HR officer looking to develop more leaders in your organization, or looking for diversion and inclusion programs for your team, or an individual taking charge of your own personal growth.

"Nyle DiMarco, a model and deaf activist, is shedding a little light on a big problem with inclusion. And he used the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a jumping off point. In April, the website Mic published an article about how MCU has a diversity problem. The article discusses at length how Marvel tends to put white men at the forefront of its stories. But like many other articles and conversations about diversity, it neglects to mention people with disabilities. So when the story popped up in DiMarco’s feed, the extremely vocal disability advocate wasn’t going to let that significant detail slide. “Disability is also a part of diversity, @mic,” DiMarco, the winner of Cycle 22 of “America’s Next Top Model” and Season 22 of “Dancing With the Stars,” wrote on Twitter. “HawkEye is actually Deaf and MARVEL Cinematic Universe made the character hearing.” Disability is also a part of diversity, @mic.HawkEye is actually Deaf and MARVEL Cinematic Universe made the character hearing.  https://t.co/xjNmv2vmMu Mic ’fessed up to its oversight and invited DiMarco to join in a lengthy and candid conversation on Tuesday about disability. “So many times people forget the disability conversation in diversity,” DiMarco told Mic. “They think diversity has to do with race [and] gender, but there’s so much more to it. We are part of diversity as people with disabilities and the danger is that we get excluded.” During the conversation, DiMarco said Hollywood has made some small strides in disability representation, but added that the film industry has quite a way to go and used the Avengers film franchise again as an example. “There are a couple of issues where specifically Hawkeye is deaf,” DiMarco said, referring to the comic books. “And so they brought in an actor who can hear instead. I think it would have made [better movies]… if they brought a deaf person in to play a deaf Hawkeye.” “I mean, no offense, but Hawkeye in the Avengers is boring. A lot of people don’t even like him… Let’s have a deaf actor in there instead, why not?” To watch DiMarco’s entire interview, which also touches on many other interesting subjects such as his sexuality and growing up in a loving community, check out the video above.",Hawkeye,mean,Avengers
"Do you have an iPhone that suddenly feels ... slower ... than ... it ... used ... to? There might be a good reason for that, Apple confirmed to media outlets Thursday: The company is deliberately slowing down some iPhones, albeit for a good reason. The batteries in older phones start to lose their oomph, especially if the devices have been repeatedly exposed to extreme temperatures. Phones used to abruptly shut themselves off if too much was asked of their decrepit batteries, since that helped protect sensitive electrical components. Beginning with a software update it pushed out last year, however, Apple tried a new tactic: slowing down devices during moments of high demand so their beleaguered batteries could keep up. Here’s how the company explained it in a statement to TechCrunch: Our goal is to deliver the best experience for customers, which includes overall performance and prolonging the life of their devices. Lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions, have a low battery charge or as they age over time, which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components.  Last year we released a feature for iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE to smooth out the instantaneous peaks only when needed to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting down during these conditions. We’ve now extended that feature to iPhone 7 with iOS 11.2, and plan to add support for other products in the future. Some outraged consumers see this as a plot by Apple to force people to upgrade their iPhones more often ― and it could certainly have that effect ― but there is a cheaper fix: replacing your battery. Before you go through the hassle, though, dig through your iPhone’s settings (here’s how) and see if your battery actually needs to be replaced. Look for this warning: Apple does display a little notice deep in settings to let iPhone users know their batteries are bad pic.twitter.com/OgeO57VfTm Apple will replace your battery for free if your phone is under warranty, according to The Verge. Otherwise, it costs about $80. If you’re willing to make the replacement yourself, you can expect to spend around $30 on the battery and necessary tools. ",consumers,see,iPhones
"I’m not often faced with my own mortality when writing about superhero movies. So when I was asked in a stranger’s apartment last week why I was “so afraid to die,” I have to admit, it threw me. My response: “Uh, could we please just talk about Loki?” In the end, astrologer Michael Lutin graciously assured me I wasn’t going to die — at least not imminently. (After drawing a picture of the Grim Reaper, he instead prophesied that I was “cursed with life.”) But too bad for the Avengers, because, as Lutin and others foretold, they won’t all be so lucky. “Avengers: Infinity War,” the latest installment in the perpetual motion machine that is Marvel, hits theaters this Friday. Starring just about every superhero in the comic universe, it’s bound to contain a particularly eventful ― and violent ― storyline. Ahead of the premiere, fans have been circling the internet in search of the answer to one vital question: Who’s going to die this time? Disney has been especially paranoid about spoilers of late, so I knew no one from the “Infinity War” cast or crew would help me answer this crucial question, or even discuss it after the movie’s release. With this in mind, I turned to another group of experts ― a diverse group of skilled individuals not unlike the Avengers who could decipher the deathly twists and turns of the upcoming film. “Psychics? Wait a minute, for real?” “Infinity War” writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely said when I later confronted them with the results of my weeklong quest for truth. I don’t have much experience with psychics, but right away, I learned they don’t normally weigh in on matters of the Marvel universe. After calling more than 30 psychics, astrologers, mediums and tarot carder readers around New York, emailing others around the country, getting denied time and time again, and waiting on doorsteps in the rain for longer than I’d like to admit, I finally scrapped together my team. Some I had to meet in secret locations; others were across the street from Taco Bell. Some communicated sparsely via email, and others made me question my own existence (and later apologized over text message). But in the end, they included tarot card reader Angela Lucy, celebrity psychic Jesse Bravo, former Vanity Fair astrologer Lutin, the Mystical Empress Brenda Renee, psychic-astrologer Amira Celon, Raphael aka “The World’s Medium” and Anthony Carr, who bills himself as “the world’s most documented psychic.”  These were the terms: I gave each participant a list of major “Infinity War” heroes and asked which names, if any, were marked for death. To aid them, I brought along a bag of relevant items specially plucked from the Hasbro toy chest that is my desk: a Civil War Blaster Reveal Shield (for Captain America), an Infinity War Hero Vision mask (for Iron Man) and a Marvel Avengers Power Hammer (for Thor). Sure, most of these experts were unfamiliar with the Marvel movies. Nonetheless, after getting my results, I presented some of the most shocking to the actual writers of “Infinity War” in a shameless interview on Sunday ― days before I’d actually see the movie. So, here’s who dies in “Avengers: Infinity War,” according to psychics, astrologers, mediums and tarot card readers. And here’s what the creators of the movie think about the undoubtedly spot-on predictions. I know! What!? Hulk wasn’t even on my radar as a possibility, but he turned out to be the character most often predicted to kick the bucket. His death was foreshadowed by celebrity psychic Jesse Bravo, whom I met in a secret location in New York City that was basically just an office he doesn’t list online in an effort to avoid people randomly showing up at his place of work unannounced. There, we sequestered ourselves in a small, windowless room (aka a closet), and he broke the news swiftly: Hulk’s going to die, he told me. Earlier in the day, I attended my first-ever tarot card reading at Angela Lucy’s apartment, where she, too, foresaw Hulk’s death. She was just as shocked as I was when she a drew a card that doomed him to an 80 percent chance of dying. “Whoa! That’s a little more scary. I didn’t expect Hulk to go. He’s always the big green guy,” she said. Two other experts who emailed me agreed with Bravo and Lucy. Colorado-based Mystical Empress Brenda Renee specializes in shamanic healing, psychic readings, quantum life-coaching sessions and feng shui, among other things. She didn’t even know the title of the movie we were talking about, so she relied on “imagination and psychic senses” to guide her way. Raphael, who was once based in Los Angeles and now just travels the world “like a digital nomad,” used his “gift of mediumship,” a bronze pendulum, a set of crystals and The Golden Tarot of the Tsar to deduce the outcome. Both came to the same conclusion: Hulk’s time may be up. Going into this, I thought Gamora, if anyone, would be the green character to bite the dust. She’s the daughter of the main villain, Thanos, and provides an ominous voice-over on various versions of the “Infinity War” trailer. However, Lucy only gave her a measly 10 percent chance of death. She even consulted the Archangel Michael to reassure me of Gamora’s fate, adding, “I can’t believe I’m taking in the archangels to find out about ‘Avengers.’” She concluded that “something bad” happens to Gamora. “Maybe she’s trapped or captured at the end and they have to go get her or something like that. She’s like out of the picture ― kind of a death. It’s a weak death, so maybe she’s in a cage or something. She’s kind of waiting in the background, so maybe she’s a damsel in distress, which she’s so not.” Robert Downey Jr.’s contract with Marvel is reportedly up after “Avengers 4,” which is the sequel to “Infinity War” expected in 2019, but if these predictions are right, it might be ending as early as the upcoming film. After drawing a chariot card during our session, Lucy gave Iron Man a 70 percent chance to die. She said he’s likely on the way out and “will make quite the exit.” “Say goodbye to Iron Man. He’s done,” Bravo reiterated after picking up the Iron Man mask I brought him.  I laughed, thinking he was joking at first. “Wait, really?” Bravo explained that his conclusion was just based on the feeling he got after seeing the names on the list. Sadly, Raphael also suggested in his predictions that Iron Man “could die.” He’s been in bad shape since “Captain America: Civil War,” but just hang in there, buddy. According to the psychics, you won’t have to suffer much longer. Bravo actually predicted that Iron Man and War Machine would exit the movie together, which makes sense since they’ve been side by side since the first “Iron Man” in 2008. Raphael agreed that it’s “very, very” likely that War Machine won’t make it, as did Renee. We didn’t see Hawkeye in the “Infinity War” trailers, which is one indication that he might be gone for good soon.  Another indication: three of the psychics, mediums and astrologers I spoke to predicted he’d bite the dust. First, psychic-astrologer Amira Celon, based in Los Angeles, California, told me over email that his name, as well as that of Drax and Loki, immediately “jumped out” to her “on a psychic level.” Then Bravo identified Hawkeye as one of the characters to go during our closet session. Finally, Raphael called his death “likely.” We were introduced to Hawkeye’s family back in “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” so his death could pack a bigger emotional punch in the latest film. Ultimately, though, haven’t we always seen this one coming? Hawkeye’s power is basically just shooting arrows really well, so ... yeah, he could die. No matter of magic hand-waving can save Elizabeth Olsen’s character from psychic predictions. It doesn’t make sense that Marvel would off Scarlet Witch so soon. After all, she’s only been in a few movies so far. But Raphael, Bravo and Renee all listed her among the victims.  Witch is one of the most powerful characters in the Marvel movies, so losing her could be an insurmountable blow to the Avengers. It doesn’t make a ton of sense, but sure. Why not? Outside of psychics and other extrasensory perceivers, most critics and fans are predicting that Captain America will die in “Infinity War.” In a recent interview with The New York Times, Chris Evans heavily hinted that he was close to leaving the shield for good. That’s why it’s surprising that only one psychic, Bravo, deemed the Cap a dead man walking. As far as the other participants, Lucy gave him a 50 percent chance of dying, suggesting he might “get into some scrapes.” Raphael said Captain America will be “lost.” “Where does he belong? What is the point? It is a moment for some training with a mentor and a successful relaunch of his skills and mission,” Raphael said, refraining from dooming Captain America to death. Bravo, on the other hand, picked up the items I brought him ― the shield, the mask and the hammer ― and said two of the three related characters would die: Captain America and Iron Man. (Thor, he explained, would have a chance at life, because he is a god.) Here is Bravo’s final list of supposed goners: Early on in the trailer, we see Loki handing an infinity stone over to Thanos, and then he’s just gone. This has led many to theorize that the lack of screen time means it’s Loki’s only scene; he’s probably going to die in “Infinity War.” Three psychics, Celon, Renee and Raphael, did predict his death, but, surprisingly, three others, Bravo, former Vanity Fair astrologer Michael Lutin and Lucy, stated that he’d survive. This was Lutin’s only prediction. He said he didn’t really know the characters and described my request as “an example of someone’s death anxiety,” but after seeing Tom Hiddleston’s birthdate (listed as Feb. 9, 1981), he said Loki would live because “he’s Aquarius,” and the “north node is in Leo” and the “south node is in Aquarius.” “He’ll have outside help. I don’t even know the characters, but I think that’s going to happen. He’s going to be severely weakened and wounded and somebody will come to help,” he said. Lucy admitted that she didn’t know who Loki is, but explained that the high priestess card she drew during our conversation meant he might do something mystical “behind-the-scenes or in secret” ― i.e., betray someone or become a double agent.  Yes, Ant-Man has a movie coming up after “Avengers: Infinity War,” but I’m just reporting what the psychics said.  “For some reason, I see him dying,” Raphael said, “even though I know there is a new movie scheduled. I see him completely defeated in the movie, I see him dead. I can be wrong, of course.” As you can see from Bravo’s list above, he also predicted Ant-Man would die, as did Renee, who by the way, sees a ton of destruction in general.  “As I was musing on the movie, without knowing a title, I saw a lot of catastrophic disaster in the movie. Lots of characters dying. It will be an epic bloody battle, and as the dust settles, a new system will be put in place to restructure the environment/world these characters inhabit,” she said. Don’t give up on Ant-Man quite yet, though. While three others picked him for death, Lucy drew a tarot card that suggests there’s something coming for Ant-Man in the future ― perhaps, in her words, another movie. It was only then I informed her “Ant-Man and the Wasp” was out later this year. Anthony Carr likes to do his own thing, and rather than make a death prediction, he gave me an equally crazy prophesy involving the Avengers and an “even greater evil,” Donald Trump: This new superhero movie ― “The Avengers” ― will create more wealth than Disney has ever known! All of the superheroes are joining forces to defeat an incredibly evil monster! But even after it’s been destroyed, they will then marshal all their combined forces in a last-ditch attempt to overcome an even greater evil, one who has already set in motion the possible destruction and annihilation of not only the human race, but this (late?) great planet Earth!... TRUMP!!!! The world will never ever be the same! What do you think about that result, Donald? Well, there you have it. Other characters appearing on at least two death lists include Nebula (predicted by Lucy and Renee), Valkyrie (predicted by Renee and Raphael), Starlord (predicted by Renee and Raphael), Mantis (predicted by Bravo and Lucy), Falcon (predicted by Bravo and Raphael) and Heimdall (predicted by Bravo and Raphael).  Somehow Vision wasn’t listed at all, which is weird considering the marketing for “Infinity War” that shows him constantly screaming in pain. So congratulations, Vision.  Regarding some of the more shocking results, “Infinity War” writer McFeely told me, “You are putting us in an awkward spot, Bill. I would have to be commenting one way or another on the powers of psychics.” His co-writer Christopher Markus, on the other hand, speculated that on the astral plane, there are an “infinite number of versions of the movie,” so “all the predictions are right in some universe.” Sounds like an endorsement to me.",you,think,result
"State Sen. Troy Balderson narrowly defeated businesswoman Melanie Leneghan on Tuesday in the hotly contested Republican primary for Ohio’s 12th Congressional District, a battle that pitted the party’s two major wings against one another. Balderson beat out Leneghan as well as seven other GOP candidates, according to The Associated Press late Tuesday. He will face businessman Danny O’Connor, who defeated five other candidates to win the Democratic nomination for a special election scheduled for Aug. 7. Balderson was endorsed in the primary race by former Rep. Pat Tiberi, the Republican who represented the Columbus-area district before stepping down in January. Tiberi, a reliable ally of the House GOP leadership, spent nearly a half-million dollars from his old campaign account to boost Balderson, viewed by the party’s establishment as a more suitable candidate to retain the suburban district, given the difficult political environment for Republicans this year. Conservatives in Congress backed Leneghan, setting up the intraparty showdown. The House Freedom Caucus, led by co-founder Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), viewed her as the more solidly conservative candidate.  Last week, the group warned GOP leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), to stay out of the primary fight. The conservative anti-tax group Club for Growth also contributed $190,000 that paid for ads supporting Leneghan. Though the 12th district has traditionally been one the GOP could count on winning, the special election is expected to be competitive. And the winner of that race should have a leg up in the November vote for a full two-year term. Balderson and O’Connor also won the primaries to face off in the November elections for the seat. In 2016, President Donald Trump carried the district by slightly more than 11 percentage points ― a concerning margin for Republicans because of increased enthusiasm among Democrats that have marked recent special elections. In the March special election for Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, for example, Democrat Conor Lamb edged his GOP opponent in a district Trump carried by 20 percentage points. “We’re looking at a situation where every seat counts” to maintain the House GOP majority, Matt Borges, the former Ohio Republican Party chairman, told Politico last month. Terming Leneghan “out-of-step with mainstream Republicans,” he added that the party didn’t need “any self-inflicted wounds” in its fight to keep control of the House. ",Balderson,beat,Press
"YouTube channel “Chemistry Flicks” has been hard at work dousing everyday objects in acid, all in the name of science. They've coated a host of items -- including fruit, meat, a lab coat, chocolate, and a smartphone -- in chlorosulfonic acid over the past two weeks. All but one of the objects ended up obliterated. And the substance that survived will probably surprise you. First up, the channel soaked a banana in the colorless, corrosive liquid: It didn't end well. Then, they used  the acid -- which is corrosive to metals and can cause severe burns -- on a sponge: The scientists then graduated to larger objects, such as this chicken breast: Curious as to how the acid, which is very toxic if inhaled, would affect their lab coats if they accidentally spilled it, they tried it out: Oops! Next, they destroyed an LG Nexus 5 smartphone: But the one substance that didn't appear to be damaged by the acid was.... Yes, chocolate! Some commenters lightheartedly suggested that lab coats should be made out of the sweet treat. ""It would definitely make science more delicious!

"Saying that budgets are moral documents, though a commonplace, is still instructive. Where you spend your money is how you signal your priorities. Or in the words of Jesus, “Where your treasure is, there will your heart also be.” That whole budgets-are-moral-documents thing came to me as I listened to a summary of the president’s new budget proposal. Cuts to the EPA, to HUD, to international economic development, to the arts and public broadcasting, to scientific research. But the thing that really exasperated me were the cuts to services for the most vulnerable among us—the poor, the elderly, the unemployed. School lunches? Meals-on-Wheels? Community development block grants? Legal aid? Seriously? And when you add that dramatic budgetary gut punch to the stunningly generous tax cut for the wealthiest Americans masquerading as healthcare reform, to the mean-spirited crackdown on immigrants and refugees, to the hate-mongering against Muslims, to the targeting of hard-won civil rights for African Americans and LGBTQ people … well, the picture is grim—especially if you happen to be a person who takes Jesus anything like seriously. But in the midst of my despair, looking for a little spiritual and ethical insight, I ran across a set of documents I didn’t know existed—which is saying something, because I try to keep up on that sort of thing. But there I was, poking about the dusty corners of the Internet and I happened to run across an ancient manuscript. Now manuscript dating is not my area of expertise, so I won’t attempt to put a date on this one. All I’m going to say is that it looked really dang old. (I realize that lacks a certain amount of academic precision, but you’re just going to have to trust me on this one.) So, I blew the digital dust off these files, broke out my Greek lexicon and went to work. And what I discovered, I think, provides a bit of insight into our current political situation. Here for you, for the first time translated into English, is the manuscript I found, entitled, Things Jesus didn’t say. Things Jesus didn’t say: ”Love your friends, bless those who bless you … and screw everybody else.” “If you had the faith of this mustard seed … you wouldn’t need all that fancy ‘affordable health care.’” “Blessed are the racists, for they will rise to great heights in the new administration.” “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? I mean, look at all these liberals, and their un-Christian ‘caring for widows, orphans, and the stranger.’ Why can’t they care about Christian stuff, like the 2nd amendment or school prayer?” “Go, sell all you have and give it to the richest one percent.” “Blessed are those who hate immigrants in my name, for they shall inherit all the jobs white people don’t want to do.” “Follow me and I will make you fishers of … people who look just like you.” “Give unto Caesar that which belongs to Caesar, and give unto God only what you can’t hide on your 1040.” “Let the little children come to me … unless they’re in Head Start or need help with school lunches, then cast them out into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of their tiny little teeth.” “Come unto me all ye who are weary and heavy laden … and I will make sure you have no union to watch over you.” “Go ye therefore into all the world … and make sure everybody hates Muslims. Because obviously.” “My God, my God, why do women not see that men should have the last word about what they do with their bodies?” “You have heard it said, ‘You shall not commit adultery, but I say to you … unless she’s a lot younger, prettier (like a model or whatever), and you’ve had enough foresight to sign a prenup.’” “You have heard it said, ‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, but I say to you … what the hell? They’ve got it coming.’” ”You have heard it said that healthcare should be a right for everyone, but I say to you, ‘If you can store up for yourselves another new Benz, even though it comes from money meant for poor people’s chemotherapy, then you should totally do it.’” “You cannot serve God and mammon … which is why it was important to have the Supreme Court rule favorably in Citizens United. Helps us keep to keep who’s who straight.” “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven … but if you have a suitably large investment portfolio, that definitely won’t hurt.” “If anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also.” (Marginalia—“This only applies to People of Color and women in abusive relationships.”) “Again, you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times, ‘You shall not swear falsely, but I say to you … just kidding. That’s for suckers!” “And I, when I am lifted up, will draw all straight, cisgender, middle class white guys unto myself.” “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep … except refugees. They definitely do not count.” “So therefore , none of you can become my disciple if you do not give up all your possessions.” (Wait. Actually, he did say that, but he probably shouldn’t have.)",I,is,one
"Microsoft is about to help the government regulate your weed. The tech giant will join forces with KIND Financial, a company that makes software for the cannabis industry, to help state and local officials track marijuana sales, according to a press release Thursday. Essentially, Microsoft's ""Azure Government” service will help ensure that legal sales of cannabis are above board. Okay, cloud computing solutions for local governments aren't exactly sexy. But Allen St. Pierre, executive director of NORML, a nonprofit advocating for marijuana law reform, says this represents a significant step forward for corporate America.  ""We're psyched to see a major company like Microsoft jump into this space. It's only going to encourage other companies to do it,"" St. Pierre told The Huffington Post on Friday.  Major corporations have been slow to embrace the weed business despite growing support for its legalization. Walgreens, for example, backpedaled this April after information about marijuana's possible health benefits appeared on the brand's website. ""The content is strictly informative, and nowhere do we take any stance on the issue,” Jim Cohn, a spokesman for Walgreen Co., told HuffPost at the time. But NORML argues the genie's out of the bottle, especially now that Microsoft is overtly supporting the industry.

"Anderson Cooper was momentarily stunned speechless when a top GOP strategist insisted he had never heard President Donald Trump tell a lie. “The president’s never lied to me and I don’t think the president’s lied to the American people,” former Trump campaign strategist David Urban said on CNN’s “Anderson Cooper 360” Wednesday. “I think the president is prone to hyperbole, yes, absolutely. Do I think he’s purposefully misleading the American people? No, I don’t.”  Cooper simply stared into the camera for seconds before responding: “Wow. Wow. Okay. I am not sure I believe ... that’s what you really believe ... Factually, he has said things which are not true, and which he obviously knows are not true.” Urban stuck to his story even when Cooper pointed out findings by The Washington Post earlier this week that Trump has lied or misconstrued facts more than 3,000 times in 466 days — “6.5 false claims a day.” Cooper added: “You’re saying you’ve never heard the president say something which is demonstrably false and he knew was false?” Urban laughed: “You’re asking me my opinion.” Trump acknowledged Thursday that he had reimbursed his personal attorney Michael Cohen for a $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels after insisting he knew nothing about it.

"You don’t matter. That’s the message every survivor hears loud and clear when a rape kit goes untested. Behind every kit is a person ― usually a woman ― who has been brutalized in the most intimate of ways. And yet there are estimated to be hundreds of thousands of untested rape kits currently sitting in police storage across the country.  So, how did we get here?  That’s the question actress and activist Mariska Hargitay answers in her new HBO documentary “I Am Evidence,” set to air April 16. The film, produced by the “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” star and Trish Adlesic, and co-directed by Adlesic and Geeta Gandbhir, takes a human approach to an epidemic that has reduced survivors, their stories and their trauma to a box of evidence.  “To me, the backlog is one of the clearest and most shocking demonstrations of how we regard these crimes in our society,” Hargitay says in the film. “Testing rape kits sends a fundamental and crucial message to victims of sexual violence: You matter. What happened to you matters. Your case matters.”  In a conversation with HuffPost, Hargitay and Adlesic laid out the herculean task they had in front of them four years ago when they began making this documentary. “One of the things that was so difficult about making this movie is that there is just so much pain involved,” Hargitay said. She hopes the documentary “holds up a real hard mirror” to people who have turned a blind eye to this epidemic.  Watch the trailer for “I Am Evidence” below. Story continues below video.  And the film is a hard one to look away from. “I Am Evidence” features 14 courageous survivors telling their stories of assault and the subsequent poking and prodding that comes with enduring a rape kit.  “I am evidence that there is more to that box, there is a human being there. It is not just a kit. This is a person,” a survivor named Erica says in the film.  The women discuss the inevitable re-victimization of being questioned by law enforcement and the agonizing wait to get their kits tested ― a wait that often never ends. “The fact of the matter is, if we have DNA testing, if we have the ability to fix this problem and we don’t test these kits, we’re saying that sexual assault is not important,” Hargitay said.   Since the rape kit backlog hit the public consciousness nearly 10 years ago, 225,000 rape kits have been uncovered, according to a program called End The Backlog. That program is the work of anti-sexual violence nonprofit The Joyful Heart Foundation, which Hargitay founded after thousands of survivors shared their abuse stories with her after she began appearing as Detective Olivia Benson on “SVU.” Testing rape kits is important for several reasons: It can identify an unknown perpetrator, it can confirm the presence of a known suspect, it can confirm a survivor’s account of an assault, it can help solve other cases that might not involve sexual violence, it can exonerate innocent people. And it can connect a suspect to other crimes around the country. Indeed, a disturbing takeaway from the film is just how common serial rapists are. One scene depicts law enforcement officials, who have finally begun testing old rape kits, linking one rapist to two women living in completely different parts of the country. By testing the kits, police are finally catching serial offenders. “I Am Evidence” lays out the root causes of this countrywide backlog: misogyny and racism. The systemic lack of policies and protocols, of resources and funding, and ― most glaringly ― of training for first responders, reflects these prejudices. As with other systems that abuse and disregard marginalized people, poor black women get the worst of it. “Nobody gives a damn about women in this country,” concludes Detroit prosecutor Kym Worthy in the film. Worthy has been tackling the rape kit backlog head-on since 2009, when 11,000 untested rape kits were uncovered in her city. Adlesic said it’s “absolutely necessary” for first responders to receive sexual assault training and recalled an “I Am Evidence” screening last year where a man made a powerful comment during the Q&A portion.  “He was quite emotional and spoke about being an emergency room doctor. He hadn’t had the training to conduct a sexual assault kit, and he was so afraid he was going to get it wrong, or make someone feel awful for not knowing how to do it,” she said. “It helped us understand that we really need to advocate for a curriculum in medical schools and law enforcement agencies so that people learn how to do this.” All too often, police officers learn the law, but no one teaches them the varying ways victims respond to trauma. Along with bringing their own prejudices to the job, officers often don’t know what trauma looks like or how trauma affects memory. They also might not realize how often sexual violence triggers involuntary paralysis in a victim ― an often-forgotten “freeze” component of the fight-or-flight reflex ― in order to get them out of the situation alive.  Hargitay described the lack of resources to investigate these crimes, as well as cultural misunderstandings surrounding sexual violence, as a “microcosm” of how we as a country regard women.  “Trish and I, we wanted to make a hard-hitting film,” she said. “It is a painful movie to watch, and it’s the facts. And it’s time that we take a look at not sweeping this under the carpet, that we treat women, and treat our society, and all survivors with the humanity, the empathy that they deserve.”  Adlesic told HuffPost she hopes this documentary forces people to care about this issue and creates change. Most of all, she hopes this film shows survivors that they’re not alone. “I want them to know that we understand, and that we care and that we want to help give them the support they need and deserve,” she said. “I want survivors to feel heard and know that they matter, and that violence against women matters, and that we walk in hand with you to a better way of life for everyone.”  “I Am Evidence” will air on HBO on Monday, April 16, at 8 p.m. Eastern. ",survivor,says,film
"You may call Jason Aldean his own worst critic.  The country star will often listen to his music over and over, or watch tapings of his performances.  “I pick all my stuff apart. I listen to it a lot. But I do that with everything,” Aldean told HuffPost. If we have a live performance on TV, I go back and watch it and go, ‘I should have done this different or that different. Or I should have done this here.’ I analyze everything.”  Aldean did that with his new album, “Rearview Town,” released on Friday. The title track, in particular, is one he analyzed a lot before releasing it. Though, now it appears he listens to it more for enjoyment that anything else. He likes its relatable premise about “leaving your hometown and putting the past behind you and moving on to something else down the road that maybe you couldn’t achieve in your hometown.” For his eighth studio album, Aldean wanted to “push the envelope,” similar to what he did with his self-titled debut in 2005.  “Early on in my career when we would make records we had a little bit of an ‘anything goes’ mentality as far as songs, and finding songs that let us step outside the box — from what everybody else was doing,” he said. “I think on the last couple of albums we played it safe ... I just wanted to get back to finding and recording songs where people would never know what’s going to come next.” The new set of 15 songs includes a mix of sounds ranging from country and blues to rock and hip-hop. It also features an appearance by Miranda Lambert on “Drowns the Whiskey.” The two previously collaborated on “Grown Woman” from Aldean’s 2007 sophomore effort. The trickiest part this time involved making sure he found the right track to introduce to Lambert.  “I actually sent her a song before I sent her ‘Drowns the Whiskey,’ and she just wasn’t loving it. She didn’t hate it. She didn’t love it. I told her if you’re going to sing on it, I want it to be something that you really like,” Aldean recalled.  Luckily, Lambert fell in love with “Drowns the Whiskey.” It’s a more traditional song ― something right in her wheelhouse, Aldean said. “One thing a lot of people don’t know about her is that she’s a really great harmony singer. Like really good,” Aldean said. “She doesn’t necessarily sing it  like if I brought in a background singer. But that’s what makes it cool. It’s very stylistic, and you can tell that it’s her. We had her come in and cranked her into the mix and it sounded great. Highlight of the record for sure.”  This album is Aldean’s first release since the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas in October. Aldean was performing onstage at the country music fest when a gunman started shooting from a nearby hotel room, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds. It was the nation’s deadliest mass shooting in modern history. Although the new songs were neither influenced nor inspired by Vegas (he completed them prior to Route 91), Aldean does mention the victims and survivors of the massacre in the liner notes; he doesn’t want people to forget what happened that night.  “I feel like a lot of times it becomes less and less of a headline as times goes on. For me, it was a way to acknowledge people that were there and let them know that a lot of time has passed now, but it’s still something I think about. I think about those people every day, and that night, I still think about all the time.” In the days after the shooting, Aldean visited hospitals and met with survivors, something that impacts him to this day.  “I don’t think you can go through something like that and have it not change you. It’s a life-altering kind of thing. It made me view a lot of things differently,” he said. “I think going and talking to some of the victims and their families and seeing the spirit that those people had was pretty amazing to see. I was going through my own stuff in private and dealing with all of it. But to go talk to all the people and see the way they were dealing with it — that had been shot. They were in great spirits and just glad to be alive. I was like, ‘Oh man, maybe I’m looking at this all wrong.’ It really helped me have a different view on it. But it’s tough. I don’t know if you ever really get over it. Hopefully it gets better.” Since the Vegas shooting, a lot of talk has surrounded gun control ― with eyes on the country music community. Aldean, a gun owner himself, recently said it’s too easy to get guns. “When you can walk in somewhere and you can get one in five minutes, do a background check that takes five minutes, like how in-depth is that background check? Those are the issues I have. It’s not necessarily the guns themselves or that I don’t think people should have guns,” he told The Associated Press. “I have a lot of them.” But when pressed on the hot-button gun debate during our interview, Aldean didn’t want to elaborate.  “I feel like it gets taken out of context, and the headline becomes that I speak out on gun control. ... I’m not saying that people should have their guns taken away,” he said. “Because I don’t think that. It’s just one of those things ― it’s like a no-win. For me, I’ve said my piece on that and people can take it for what they want to.” With that, Aldean wants to focus on his new music and his return to the stage, with a major tour kicking off in May. Playing live is still where he feels most at ease.  “I know I’m not the best singer,” Aldean, ever the self-critic, said. “That’s my thing ― you put me onstage and you put me in front of people, that’s where I’m comfortable.”  Now, more than a decade into his career, Aldean continues to attract a large audience. Over the weekend, he returned to Las Vegas for the Academy of Country Music Awards, where he took home Entertainer of the Year for the third consecutive time.  “I feel like I’m able to pick songs that work for me,” he said about his success, adding, “and being able to work hard when you do get the opportunities and take advantage of things and be able to sustain it.” ",set,includes,rock
"The Minneapolis police officer who fatally shot an Australian woman in July after she called 911 for help has been charged with murder by Hennepin County prosecutors, officials announced. Mohamed Noor, the officer who shot Justine Damond, turned himself in after authorities issued an arrest warrant Tuesday on charges of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said during a press conference. Noor was booked at Hennepin County Jail around 11 a.m. on Tuesday, and prosecutors requested a judge set his bail at $500,000, according to Freeman. Noor’s attorney did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Damond’s family applauded the charges in a statement, calling them “one step toward justice.” “No charges can bring our Justine back,” the family wrote. “However, justice demands accountability for those responsible for recklessly killing the fellow citizens they are sworn to protect, and today’s actions reflect that.” The decision comes more than three months after Freeman’s initial deadline for announcing whether he would bring charges against Noor.  “Because the investigation was thorough, we have a nearly second-by-second understanding of what happened, from the moment she called 911 to the moment she was fatally shot by Officer Noor, 13 minutes later,” Freeman said during the press conference Tuesday. In the eight months leading up Tuesday’s charges, many questions remained about what prompted Noor, 32, to fire his weapon on July 15, 2017 from the passenger seat of a police cruiser, across his partner and through the driver-side window, fatally striking Damond in the abdomen. Noor and his partner, Matthew Harrity, were responding to Damond’s report of a possible nearby sexual assault. They were startled by a “loud slap” on their vehicle, Harrity told investigators. An attorney for Harrity said it’s possible the officers were concerned about being ambushed, though Damond’s neighbors have questioned this response, given the area’s low crime rate. Noor, who was put on paid administrative leave following the shooting, did not provide a statement to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which conducted an investigation and gave its findings to the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office in September. “There is no evidence that Officer Noor encountered a threat, appreciated a threat, investigated a threat, or confirmed a threat that justified his decision to use deadly force,” Freeman said Tuesday. “Instead, Officer Noor recklessly and intentionally fired his gun from the passenger’s seat.” The officers’ body cameras were only activated after the shooting, Freeman said.  Damond’s death sparked protests across Minneapolis. The Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have a history of high-profile police brutality incidents, including the July 2016 shooting death of Philando Castile in the suburb of Falcon Heights. A week after Damond’s death, Minneapolis Police Chief Janeé Harteau was forced to resign. Justice for Justine, a group of Damond’s neighbors and friends, praised the charges in a statement emailed to HuffPost. “We are relieved that her killer is being prosecuted and hope for a swift trial that is respectful to Justine and her loved ones,” the statement read. “Police need to be held accountable for their actions that harm individuals and damage communities, just as any one of us would be held accountable.” Justine Damond's friends and neighbors release a statement on the murder charges brought against her killer, Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor, eight months after her death.https://t.co/hMkkDfTVDC pic.twitter.com/PbpkCfbfaa Although the charges against Noor may provide some temporary relief to Damond’s family and friends, prosecutors still face an uphill battle. Between 2005 and April 2017, only 35 percent of officers charged with murder or manslaughter for fatal on-duty shootings were convicted, according to research conducted by Philip Stinson, an associate professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green State University in Ohio.

"By Nechama Sammet Moring  I’ll start with saying me too, without details, because, if my social media feed is any kind of indicator, sexual violence is as common as brunch, Buzzfeed quizzes and adorable doggos. The #MeToo campaign, first envisioned by activist Tarana Burke, demonstrates the vast prevalence of sexual assault as its survivors say, simply, “me too.” The 1.7 million tweets and 12 million Facebook posts of #MeToo put faces to estimates that at least one in three  women have experienced sexual violence, with higher rates among people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, gender-queer, disabled and/or of color. #MeToo is simultaneous lauded as empowering and critiqued as creating emotional demands and re-opening wounds for survivors. The viral hashtag also begs questions for men, often posed on social media: If women and gender nonconforming people are all posting that they too have been assaulted, who is perpetrating all this assault? And what will you do to decrease the sky-high rates of sexual violence? In my feeds, the first question was rarely answered; much like racism, sexual assault is seen as an external phenomenon, something other people do, but never something that any of us (however we define our in-group) might contribute to in any way. To be clear, men and boys are also victimized by sexual violence (about one in six boys and one in 72 adult men) but perpetrators are largely male, pointing to a culture of violent masculinity. The second question gained traction, though, as men used the hashtag #IWill to describe the actions they would personally take to end sexual assault—with disappointing results. Many responses I saw on my own feeds, in searches, and in response to questions from groups like The Belle Jar and Guerilla Feminism were overwhelmingly vague (“support the women my life,” “stand up against sexism”). Quite a few explicitly asked for recognition (“I promise I’m better than my brothers,” “I will tell my students that rape is wrong, because I care”). Some even got weirdly sexual—worse than that guy in every women’s studies 101 class who thinks nobody realizes that he’s only there in hopes of getting laid (“while every man appreciates a good boobie, I will remember that there’s a time and a place,” “I will get enthusiastic consent from all my lovers. Any lesbians interested? I’m 5’9”).  With the exception of some of my male friends, I did not see many pledges of concrete action. Also missing was commitment to taking risks that could incur personal costs, such as denouncing the senior manager at work who has a history of brushed aside sexual harassment, interrupting the man talking over female colleagues, even if he is your boss, or telling your brother that misogynistic comments at the dinner table will get him kicked out before the meal is cold. These are real costs, but I did not see many men willing to spend social capital for me and other survivors. Many of the promises were, as a friend said, the bare minimum of human decency, the equivalent of claiming, in a job interview, that, if hired, you will wear pants to work and reserve tardiness for Tuesday through Friday, when you are hungover. Yes, men will listen to women when they speak; it is a generally accepted social convention that one listens to one’s conversation partner. Yes, men who teach or coach teenagers are generally expected to respond to negative adolescent behavior, including shutting down “locker room talk” among their charges. Are we also applauding me for not kicking my dog, and flossing semi-regularly?  I have higher expectations than this for everybody, but especially people privileged enough to not be consumed with the strategic planning required just to make it home safe at night, to survive the relationships that wait for us there, or to hold it together when everyday situations like footsteps in the hall at work remind us of the sounds of our rapist’s sneakers as he moved towards us. I imagine there’s a lot one can do with the time that we survivors must devote to strategy and staying present despite approaching footfalls. Other statements from men included misguided bragging about relationships of mutuality with women and marginalized genders, which I also enjoy with the men I love. Male friends have driven me to the airport; taken me home from surgery when I was hopped up on painkillers, fed me and walked my dog while I babbled incoherently; encouraged me to start my small business; read my writing; believed me when I left my abuser and supported me during intense flashbacks; hosted me when my apartment was fumigated; and made me laugh until beer came out of my nose. But this is friendship, not heroic acts against sexual violence. It’s time to ask for more—to demand more. So, men: what concrete action will you take to end sexual violence? How exactly will you stand up for us? What fundraiser will you organize? Which rapist will you fire? Which marginalized person’s lead will you follow, on their terms? How will you create a world where we can make it home at night, without threats from those closest to us? What risks will you take? What costs will you incur? Because whatever the risk or the cost is for you, I guarantee it is higher for me, and so your bravery is needed.",I,see,action
"The Decameron by John William Waterhouse (1916) Boccaccio's 14th century masterpiece has inspired artists for centuries, from Chaucer to Shakespeare and from Voltaire to Poe. His classic recounts how seven women and three men, who escaped from a plague-ravished Florence to the countryside, entertain themselves over two weeks, each telling 10 stories a piece.  Some of the tales are bawdy, some tragic, numerous are of greed, and many flow forth with tears and laughter only true love can elicit. Here's an unvarnished view of a battered world that's soon to be rejuvenated by the Renaissance, but not yet. In 1971, the often notorious Pier Paolo Pasolini captured the genius of the work in his Decameron. Licentious, slightly blasphemous, and always vital, his take throws you directly into the tales without the framing device of the narrators. Instantly, you find yourself in the midst of the mayhem of the Middle Ages with its steamy throngs of folks trying to survive by ferreting out anyone walking by who is more imbecilic, more naïve, or more tipsy than they are.  Working for the nuns in Pasolini's Decameron (1971) For example, a simpleton, trying to buy a horse in the big city, overnight finds himself with a ""sister"" he never knew he had, nearly drowns in feces, is robbed of his coins and clothing, and winds up sealed in the stone coffin of a newly dead Church official. Then there's the priest who convinces a travelling companion that he can turn the gent's wife into a mare. He starts this process without forewarning the gullible creature that getting the mare's tail in place requires some rear entry maneuvers by the holy man upon the said wife. And shortly, we're introduced to an attractive young field worker who feigns he's deaf and dumb so he can get a job in a nunnery for a little hanky-panky. What he winds up with is more panky than he can hanky. As for the casting, you never saw so many extras with poor dental work, and all are attired in well-worn togs. These folks truly inhabit an Italy that is believable from the get-go as the one representing Boccaccio's inspiration. Now to Wondrous Boccaccio, the wobbly new offering from the octogenarian Taviani brothers, Paolo and Vittorio. Here's a leaden affair with some lovely visuals and colorful gowns that seem just picked up from the dry cleaners. One might want to cite the directors' age as a factor why these helmers of such classics as Padre Padrone (1977) and Good Morning Babylon (1987) have produced a film with such enervated pacing, lackluster staging, and listless editing, but just back in 2012, they gave us the stellar Cesar Must Die. That effort where genuine prisoners perform Julius Caesar is nigh perfect and never for a second lethargic. So forget blaming age.  Ten storytellers escaping the Black Death in the Taviani brothers' Wondrous Boccaccio at the Tribeca Film Festival Anyway, one tale that starts off well is that of an overtrustful oaf, who is convinced by his fellow workers that if he holds a certain black rock he will become invisible. The chap finds such a stone, and not knowing the whole village is in on the joke, believes he is imperceptible to the human eye, and accordingly goes about town stealing coins, breaking wares, and trying to touch a young girl's breasts. He's in ecstasy until he returns home, and his wife, not knowing of the prank, addresses her spouse as if she can see him. Furious, he brutally beats her, banging her against walls, and then sits down at the dinner table, not knowing his wife is about to bash his head in with the rock. Cut to the male narrator of the tale who thwacks his own head with a watermelon. There are no laughs because the violence as enacted beforehand disallows one to chuckle at this tale. A pure case of tone-deafness. Another yarn has a father, who's incestuously in love with his daughter, ordering her paramour to be killed with dire results right out of Romeo and Juliet. Poorly enacted with an unconvincing buildup, there's also little convincing chemistry between the leads. The same troubles almost upend a tale right out of O. Henry. A young impoverished gent, obsessively in love with a mother with a sick child, will do anything for her. And when she comes over to ask a favor, he has nothing to serve but his pet falcon. Oh, no! What if her favor involves this very falcon? What's strange here is that the joy of Boccaccio's little sagas still seep through: his unbridled originality, his ability to skewer the foibles of humankind with a wicked joy, and his high veneration of both love and sex in equal measure. However, the Tavianis' renderings lack luster. Pasolini's shimmers still over four decades later.",he,finds,breasts

There's a rip-roaring, malevolently Machiavellian, viciously nasty, blood-letting saga of intrigue and incest on view just now.  No, not in the cloistered cloakrooms of the U.S. House of Representatives; no incest there, presumably.  The cornucopian epic in question can be found at Broadway's Winter Garden, where the Royal Shakespeare Company's impressively adventurous production of Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall has set up shop for fifteen weeks. Wolf Hall is the five hour, two-session historical drama of deceit and betrayal in the court of King Henry VIII based on Dame Hilary Mantel's Booker Prize-winning novels, ""Wolf Hall"" and ""Bring Up the Bodies.""  The two plays, adapted by Mike Poulton, were major 2014 hits for the RSC.  The theatrical tour de force has now been transported to New York, complete with a cast of twenty-three members of British Equity.  Presented in Stratford and London under the titles of Mantel's two best-selling fictional novels, they are here more simply called Wolf Hall: Parts 1 & 2. Ms. Mantel's conceit is to chronicle the rise of Thomas Cromwell (Ben Miles), a lowly blacksmith's-son-turned-lawyer who becomes the all-powerful ""fixer"" for King Henry VIII (Nathaniel Parker).  Henry has a problem, as the play begins: his long-time wife Katherine of Aragon (Lucy Briers) has been unable to bear a son.  What to do?  His solution is to get rid of Katherine so he can marry the presumably more fertile Anne Boleyn (Lydia Leonard).  How to accomplish this, given the opposition of the Catholic Church--and the all-powerful Pope--to divorce?  When his royal ministers cannot devise a course of action, Henry enlists the lower-class Cromwell.  He manages to pull it off, knocking off the principled Sir Thomas More (John Ramm) in the process and becoming Henry's Master Secretary.

This is familiar ground; at least it is for British audiences.  U.S. patrons with intensive PBS training will be right at home in Henry's court, although it was apparent at a packed and enthusiastic press preview that the story is not quite so familiar here.  (The sudden identification of one of the ladies-in-waiting near the end of the first act--""Oh, I'm nobody, I'm only Jane Seymour""--is clearly intended to have maximum effect, but the moment doesn't land quite so well if only a sliver of the audience realize that she is to be the next Mrs. Henry.)  As for More, that ""Man for All Seasons"" as Robert Bolt so memorably sketched him, he is here drawn as something of a weasely martinet who is not mourned when Henry has them chop off his head.  I suppose that in life, More was more admirable and Cromwell more slimy than suggested in Wolf Hall.  No matter, as More eventually won sainthood and an Oscar.   Poulton is a prolific dramatist specializing in adaptations; he has previously been represented here by the Alan Bates vehicle Fortune's Fool.  He has skillfully whittled down Mantel's two-volume, 1,100-page work so that it veritably breezes by in the theatre.  Full credit also goes to his all-important collaborator on the project, director Jeremy Herrin.  When your audience streams eagerly back to their seats for the second act of the first play, knowing that they have another hour plus another full-length evening to come--you know you have them well and truly hooked.  Christopher Oram, of Red and Frost/Nixon, provides a massive but simplistic set for all seasons, which allows the director to keep things flowing.  The company also make effective use of the auditorium, with the stage area spilling over onto the orchestra floor.  Costumes (by Oram), lights and sound add to the panoply. Central to the proceedings is Mr. Miles (previously seen here as Tom, the complaisant veterinarian, in the 2009 import of Alan Ayckbourn's three-part Norman Conquests).  Cromwell is ever-present in this sixteenth century tale, and he--rather than the legendarily larger-than-life Henry--remains our focus throughout.  Miles carries it off with the presence of--well, Paul Scofield in A Man for All Seasons.  He is ably supported by Mr. Parker, who brings us a human Henry who struggles to believe in the right of what he is doing.  Ms. Leonard, too, makes a strong showing as a Machiavellian Anne Boleyn.  The personae is filled  with interesting characterizations from the company, most of whom play multiple roles.

Through what was likely an unforeseen consequence, the RSC's two-part adaptation of Mantel's novels arrived on our shores the very same time that the BBC's six-part television adaptation began airing on PBS.  The TV version is built around the Cromwell of Mark Rylance.  Not wanting to cloud my reaction to the plays, I have refrained from watching the series; one imagines that Rylance, being Rylance, is commanding.  But that is suitable for watching in your living room or on your tablet. The RSC Wolf Hall offers an evening--or, rather, two evenings--of live, inventively rousing theatricality.

"WASHINGTON ― A 30-year-old former CIA employee who the federal government suspects of ― but has not charged with ― giving a massive trove of agency documents to WikiLeaks is also facing charges in Virginia, where he’s accused of snapping photos as he sexually assaulted a passed-out friend as she lay on the floor of his bathroom. Joshua Adam Schulte was arrested in August on federal child pornography charges, but it wasn’t until Tuesday that The Washington Post and The New York Times reported the government was interested in Schulte because it suspected him of providing WikiLeaks with thousands of documents on the CIA’s hacking operations. The “Vault 7 leak,” published in March 2017, was the largest loss of classified documents in CIA history. Schulte’s Manhattan apartment was searched one week after it was published. The government still hasn’t brought a case against Schulte in connection with WikiLeaks’ publication of the documents. Instead, they charged Schulte in August with child pornography over videos found on an encrypted computer server he started back in 2009 when he was in college. His lawyers have said that dozens of people had access to that server. The FBI also sent along photos they obtained from one of Schulte’s phones to prosecutors in Loudoun County, where he lived when he worked for the CIA. The photos, taken in April 2015, show a woman “passed out on the floor” of his bathroom and being sexually assaulted. The unnamed woman has been referred to as Schulte’s friend and former roommate. The government said in October that the county conducted its own investigation and interviewed the victim after the FBI provided the photographs. In November, according to federal prosecutors, Schulte was charged with two crimes: a felony count of object sexual penetration and a misdemeanor count of unlawful creation of an image of another. “The victim remembers the night in question. It was one of the few nights that she passed out and didn’t remember what occurred. She could also, apparently, identify the bathroom, which was the bathroom where she was staying as a roommate of Mr. Schulte’s,” a federal prosecutor said at a hearing in January. The government told the judge that the woman was unconscious at the time, and was unable to identify Schulte as assaulting her. But prosecutors in Virginia, the federal government told the court, were evidently able to confirm that the pair of hands depicted assaulting the woman belonged to Schulte. But even if it wasn’t Schulte who assaulted the victim, the federal prosecutor said it was “outrageous that Mr. Schulte would keep these types of images of someone who is supposed to be his friend on his phone” and contended it “shows more than just someone who wants to look at things; it shows someone who cannot control their impulses.” Schulte had been released on strict bail conditions in September but was detained in December after he was charged in Virginia as a result of the information the FBI had given to local prosecutors. Prosecutors also said he’d violated his release conditions by accessing his email as well as the anonymous internet network TOR. The new charge, they said, “shows that the defendant is someone who will act out on his impulses and actually engage in sexually dangerous behavior.” Neither Schulte’s attorney nor the Loudoun County prosecutor responded to HuffPost’s request for comment on those charges. The status of the Virginia case isn’t entirely clear. “Virginia never came to get him,” his lawyer said at the hearing in January. “Virginia just didn’t do anything in this case.” His lawyer said Virginia was “just sitting back and waiting to see what happens” with the case and that the state had “no interest in Mr. Schulte.” The only case against Schulte listed in Loudoun County court records available online is an old traffic offense. Schulte was recently assigned a federal public defender after his private attorney dropped out. The Times reported that Schulte’s family had spent most of their savings on legal fees. Meanwhile, Schulte remains in federal custody. Evidently a fan of Ayn Rand, he’s also begun writing lengthy, pseudonymous essays about the injustices of the federal criminal system for “John Galt’s Legal Defense Fund,” according to the Post and the Times. The Facebook page, a reference to the hero of Atlas Shrugged, had just two likes as of Tuesday.

"In the fall of 2013, James Bay played an intimate gig in New York City as part of the CMJ Music Festival. He was just at the start of his career, performing for maybe a hundred or so people.  “It feels like a short space of time,” he said when I asked him about that CMJ show. “That does in so many respects feel like yesterday, to be where I’m at now and talking to you.” In the last five years, the English singer has put out multiple EPs and released his full-length debut album, featuring the single “Let It Go.” He’s been nominated for three Grammys, and in March, he made his debut on “Saturday Night Live.” On May 18, he’ll unveil his sophomore album, “Electric Light.” He’s also done away with his signature long hair.  “It’s been a lot of fun,” Bay said about the last few years. “It’s been an amazing journey. I think I’d be a little bit insane if I didn’t think I was still on some sort of ride. I’m only 27, still got so much to do and to prove and all that stuff.” We caught up about “all that stuff,” along with his thoughts on the Me Too movement and working alongside “Stranger Things” actress Natalia Dyer.  “Electric Light” really feels like a full album. I don’t know if that’s because of the cool commentary throughout it. Is that what you wanted to do ― put out an album that people would listen to you from start to finish? Yes. I think to some degree. I’ll be honest with you, yes I’ve done that because I’ve grown up seeing albums to be full bodies of work that you’re supposed to listen to start to finish ... I’ve been quite inspired by movies making this album. Some of the soundscapes on some of the tracks are quite cinematic. Of course, there’s the intro dialogue, and there’s interlude dialogue halfway through, which cuts very loosely on some of the running commentary through the lyrics of the album. The other thing I’d say is, yes, it was quite a cinematic atmosphere I was living in, and I was feeling inspired by movies as much as I was other artists and songwriters. I think movies, in addition to music, can make you feel a specific way. Are there any movies that you’ve seen recently that really made you feel something, that really inspired you? There’s a big theme on this album I’ve made of unity and the importance of being together with each other, but very much physically … and in the world together, as opposed to just getting in touch with each other through our phones and whatever. I remember I rewatched “Interstellar,” which has some incredible beats and heart-wrenching emotional thread running through it. I remember another movie I saw was a movie called “Detroit” … It was fantastic, but it was pretty excruciating at the same time. It was in response to movies like that and also in response to things that have gone on in my life with relationships and people I know, even extending to one of my first albums that made unity this huge theme in my songwriting. I only realized that after I’ve written the songs. I actually saw ”Call Me by Your Name” very recently. That’s a stunning film. These movies have made me yearn for being with people, in the presence of my friends, as opposed to just being in touch with them, like say, on my phone or something. That isn’t enough. I toured my first album and I had this great heightened sense of unity and togetherness, being in front of massive crowds, what I sing in front of massive crowds, being in rooms with all these people. From the movies I’ve seen to the experiences I’ve had over the last three or four years, it’s that great sense of unity that has inspired the music. There are specific songs like “Us” that I feel like that unity theme comes through. It is one of the greater examples of what I’ve just been talking about. It was a wild experience writing that song because it was one of those rare, few magical moments. It just does not happen with every song you write. It might not even happen with the favorite song you’ve ever written. Some songs come in this flash of consciousness, and there’s something a little bit magical about it. An hour or two passes, and you’ve got this song. You don’t quite know how it came together, but it did. It just flowed through. That’s what happened with “Us.” Me and my friend, John, sat down at the beginning of a day to muscle through the day and try and get anything. In the first couple hours, we sat around the piano, and everything fell into place, lyrics included, and the song was born. It was one of those rare moments where you feel like that one was waiting to come. That was the moment that we got lucky enough to be there to receive it. What do you hope people feel or take away from listening to your new record? With my music, like with any music, I hope people are moved. There is listening to music. There’s enjoying a song, and then there’s being moved by it, which is a whole other level of experience. I hope that happens to the people that listen to music of mine because that’s a very human feeling. As humans, we’re the only things who we know that we can feel sadness. We can feel happiness, and we can feel all the mad feelings in-between. I hope people look a little deeper into the past in their lives, the future. Like we do when we listen to music, I hope they feel. I hope they express things in response to this music and talk to each other. This is what you want from your music. You want people to cry or laugh or feel brave or feel courage. I want those things. I also like that introduced this album with a very cool video starring Natalia Dyer on “Wild Love.” What was it like to film that and work alongside her? She’s an actress of the moment right now, obviously, with “Stranger Things.” Big time. Yes, definitely. It was an absolute honor. She’s an enormous talent. Right at the beginning of her career she used to do things in the public eye with so much talent and so much future potential for whatever she does next. That’s very inspiring. I am by no means an actor, so of course I was terrified and nervous. On top of that, I’m a big “Stranger Things” fan. I was trying to keep my shit together. She’s wonderful as a person. She’s got her head screwed on. She’s very cool, calm and collected and inspiring to be around. As an artist in my own right and her as an artist in her own right, that’s a really cool thing that you get to collaborate in that capacity. I was learning a lot when I had her on set. I was plainly learning a lot. She was walking into my world but bringing her own world in as the pro actor opposite me the absolute novice. Is there any extra pressure coming out of the gate with your sophomore album following Grammy noms and a hit song? There’s something in a slightly twisted way that I enjoy about that. I enjoy the pressure. I enjoyed it because it’s very exciting to the music, this fuel to be inspired, to conquer that obstacle of pressure and expectation to not necessarily do the same again. Life is longer than that, and anyone’s career could be longer than one-and-half to two albums. There’s also a place for it. It’s always extremely exciting. I believe eternally in this music that I’ve created. As soon as people get to it, and they are already, it’ll all start to unfold in a way I want it to and I’ve been excited for it to do. Of course, it comes with pressure, but that’s great. If it didn’t come with pressure, none of this would matter. That’s the way that I look at it. What would be the point?  Whose career would you say you admire the most or that you look up to in terms of music? There’s a few names spring to mind: David Bowie, Michael Jackson, Prince. Beyoncé is a big one as well, because she’s the king and queen of music all rolled into one. She’s the absolute superstar. I think I look at those artists and say “wow” because they dared to do things differently. They pushed their own boundaries beyond what anybody else, any of their diehard fans expected. They trust their fans, and they understand that those fans believe and are wanting to go the distance with them. You need that exciting friction in a relationship with your fans, or with your girlfriend. You need that what’s-going-to-happen-next feeling. If things feel too expected, then again what’s the point? If everybody thinks they know what’s coming and then they get what they thought was coming, it’s going to go quiet or boring pretty quick. Those artists that I named, they’re the ones who have really inspired me since I started listening to music, but particularly since I’ve moved from my first record into my second one.  I was at the Grammys back in January, and it was in the midst of the Me Too movement. I spoke to a lot of artists on the red carpet about that representation. Why do you think it’s, one, important, and what can we do to get more equality in music? We have to do the most obvious things. The first thing that springs to mind is if you are an employer, whether you’re a man or a woman, and you have two potential employees in front of you ― I think at this stage, if they’re both in the final stages of the interview and one of them is male and one of them is female, employ the female because she’s already gone the distance, has the qualifications and all the things that you need her to have. There are just not enough females in this industry and in many industries. You have to make that stand ... We’re lacking in females in the music industry, in the entertainment industry and all the way up the ladder. Some people will go, “There’s loads in this area of this industry.” That doesn’t matter. There aren’t enough in this other area of this industry. It’s not even. It’s completely unfair at the moment. It’s completely male-led, and it has always been. We’re just waking up now. If we’re going to wake up, we can’t just say, “Yes, I’m woken up. I’m there.” You have to act on it. My own experience, I started touring five years ago. For the first couple years, there were only guys on the bus, and it sucked. It was what was at hand at the time. I was somebody who was nowhere and nobody. It was people recommending people, and me going, “You’ve been recommended. And I just need someone now.” It was always a male person. I took what was there. As soon as I got half a second to think about it and try and calculate it, I went out and found a female keys player, female backing singers, a female guitar tech, something that you don’t find. I have female production manager. It’s not rocket science, just make it happen.  I think you’re an example of someone who make it happen and at such an early part of your career that you’re able to do that. I think there’s a glaring omission. We’ve covered it in all this unnecessary confusion. There’s no confusion. Just employ women in these industries, in all industries all the way up the ladder to the top. Real simple. Sorry, it’s impossible not to get passionate about it. Isn’t it? I could hear it in your voice. I know the themes on the record are about unity, but I feel like that almost harkens back to equality in some ways, I suppose.  I think they go hand in hand. I realized a lot of the things that was recorded in hindsight. I just made music, and I just wrote songs about things I was feeling. Then I look back and went, “What am I saying here?” To what do you feel you owe your success? It’s endless amounts of hard work. It’s more hard work than I have even come to appreciate yet. I’ll never know how much ― I’ll just have to keep working hard, and that is paired with a little bit of luck. I have no control over the luck. If you work really hard, you can almost make your luck, but there’s always a little bit of luck that’ll be completely out of your control. That’s just the way it goes. Otherwise, you just have to work tirelessly and believe in yourself. It all sounds like cheesy cliché stuff they say in the movies, but it’s true. You got to believe or else no one else will. What would you say is the biggest misconception or something that people really don’t know about you, having been thrust into the spotlight in the last couple years? I don’t just play slow sad songs [laughs]. I like playing slow sad songs. I really love that emotional side to making music and to my music. But come to show; you’ll see a lot more. You’ll love it just as much. I almost guarantee it. A lot of attention had been paid to your hair. Are you surprised that so many people have been asking you about cutting your locks shorter? In this day and age, unfortunately I’m not surprised, but it’s fine. It’s all hilarious, wonderful and lovely that people want to make something out of that. I named different artists earlier like David Bowie from the past, an artist who often changes his look and his aesthetic. I was inspired by that as much as more recent times. You’ve got Lady Gaga, who’s an artist who does that kind of thing, too. I just think it’s cool that those artists dare to switch it up so drastically and in some cases so frequently. Who wants to be the same person, the exact same person that they were five years ago? Not me. I think it’s more my duty and my responsibility to push boundaries and change than it is to remain the same old thing.  This interview has been edited and condensed.

"From VetStreet's Dr. Patty Khuly: It’s all fun and games until someone ends up in a cone. So goes the caption to an irresistible LOLcat image I keep on my smartphone. It’s one that serves to underscore the immense pleasure we humans seem to get from subjecting our pets to the “cone of shame.” Variously known as the “E-collar” (short for “Elizabethan collar”), the “lampshade,” the “satellite dish” and “that ungodly torture device that goes around her neck,” the ubiquitous plastic cone is by far the most common solution to the problem of postoperative incision complications and other areas in need of self-trauma avoidance. That’s because most pets have a thing about licking at their incision sites, pawing at their itchy ears, rubbing their irritated eyes and generally scratching and chewing at body parts they shouldn’t. But what’s worse than having to force your pet to wear the cone? Having to deal with the ravages inherent to self-trauma situations in pets. After all, restitching incision sites isn’t fun for anyone. And blowing beaucoup bucks on antibiotics after she has overdone it on what was once a simple scratch is no fun either. Given these alternatives, keeping one of these devices on your pet would seem to be the lesser of two evils. When E-Collars Don't Work But let’s say you have a pet who performs one of the following tricks when he’s sporting an E-collar: Assuming your pet is like one of the previous examples, for whom the cone seems a solution far worse than the cure it’s designed to effect, you should know that you have plenty of options to choose from when it comes to the wider family of devices known as “avoidance” tools: 1. The BiteNot collar. This is, effectively, a neck brace. But, at the outset, let me just offer that if the satellite dish lacks appeal because it seems more like a cumbersome instrument of torture than a medical device, this ginormous neck brace alternative is not going to win you over. Nonetheless, the BiteNot collar does work well for some pets — especially for lesions on the upper limbs and torso (not so much for pets who chew at their feet and tails and definitely not for scratching issues). At the very least, it isn’t likely to be misused as a weapon of mass domestic destruction. 2. The blow-up neck pillow. You know those pillows you buy last minute at the airport whenever you realize you’ve been rescheduled onto an evil red-eye flight? Picture a blow-up, neck-circling device that keeps creatures from turning full-circle. I like it because it seems more comfortable than either an E-collar or a BiteNot, and it works a little like both. In my experience, however, it doesn’t work as well for highly destructive big dogs. They tend to pop it pretty quickly. 3. The paper collar. If heavy-duty plastic is frustratingly and painfully firm, try a soft collar (the E-collar “lite”). Some pets do well with these firm-paper alternatives. Surprisingly. They wear out faster and they won’t work for the truly motivated, but they’re an option for the more relaxed pets among us.  4. Boxer shorts, sweaters, booties, baby onesies and bandages. Garments and bandages can be amazingly helpful for keeping pets away from their areas of excess interest. Unfortunately, however, they’re not usually sufficiently effective on their own — with or without no-lick sprays (which have never worked very well for my pets but may work for yours). Nonetheless, these tricks are always worth a try. What’s more, when they’re paired with some of the other above approaches they tend to yield results for some of the more avid lickers. 5. Full body armor. Consider this a variation on the garment approach above. Some pets will always still manage to reach the spot. And when all else fails, body armor is the next step. Several companies make these outfits with the extra-motivated chewer in mind. Ask your veterinarian for a recommendation. Have a Better Idea? In case this laundry list of highly imperfect avoidance options doesn’t make it obvious, let me come right out and say it: The world could use some better solutions for pets who self-traumatize. Veterinarians, at least, would be eternally grateful. Perhaps you have a solution we need to hear about. If so, now’s your turn to speak up!",that,Picture,circle
"Donald Trump has not been a big believer in tax collection. When Hillary Clinton alleged he did not pay federal income taxes for years, he responded, “That makes me smart.” Treasury Secretary Mnuchin was less upfront about tax collection in his confirmation hearings. Secretary Mnuchin confirmed his awareness of the consequences of budget cuts to the IRS on revenue collection during his confirmation hearing with the Senate Finance Committee, noting in his prepared remarks, “it is likely that further cuts to the IRS will indeed hamper our ability to collect revenue.” During the testimony, Mnuchin took his comments for the record one step further, adding, “I can assure you that the president-elect understands the concept of ‘we add people, we make money,’ […] That’s a very quick conversation with Donald Trump.” Studies of IRS revenue collection agree strongly with the Treasury Secretary on the opportunity to increase collection by funding enforcement initiatives. Indeed, already low-hanging fruit, in the form of additional government revenue collection, is increasingly within reach: in 2016 the collection of $100 of revenue cost only 35 cents, down from 53 cents in 2010, according to the IRS 2016 Data Book. Years of consecutive budget cuts to the IRS have reduced agency staff by 17 percent since 2010. Despite Secretary Mnuchin’s assurances and the CBO’s 2016 estimated return of between $1.20 and $9.00 per dollar of investment in various IRS enforcement initiatives, the President’s latest budget proposal would cut IRS funding by $239 million. The largest parts of that cut of approximately two percent (likely equivalent to more than 3.5 percent after adjusting for inflation) are directed towards enforcement. Efforts to weaken rather than bolster the IRS present challenges to an already under-resourced agency, and opportunity to those who seek to find “smart’ ways to avoid paying their federal income taxes. Relative to the drastic funding cuts that IRS officials had feared, or to the cuts proposed for some agencies and programs (for example, a 31.4 percent cut to the Environmental Protection Agency and a 40 percent cut to job training programs), the IRS may seem comparatively unscathed. However, as discussed above, the relationship between funding and expense is different for the IRS. As noted by current IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, “essentially, the government is losing billions to achieve budget savings of a few hundred million dollars.” If further weakening of IRS funding doesn’t do enough damage to the federal government’s ability to collect revenue, an even more worrisome possibility looms. Commissioner Koskinen was appointed by President Obama. His last day in office is November 9th of this year ― less than five months from now. Who will replace Koskinen? And will the replacement be someone who survives a Senate confirmation process in which Trump’s hidden tax returns and purported decades of audits becomes a major topic of discussion? Or instead will we witness the temporary appointment of an IRS director focused on aiding Trump and his allies rather than collecting revenue? Trump’s selection of corporate lawyer Keith Noreika as acting director of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has created a dangerous precedent, which could be used to severely hamper attempts at IRS modernization and enforcement. Noreika went directly from being a law firm partner to Acting Comptroller of the Currency. Would Trump appoint a Trump Organization Accountant to become Acting Commissioner of the IRS? Should the Trump administration place a non-confirmed acting director atop the IRS, an already-stacked deck would further favor the private-sector parties aiming to get around collection. Additionally, such an appointment would create an informational asymmetry, as after up to 130 days as agency head (or more, there’s very little enforcement behind rules around acting appointees), the appointee could return to the private-sector with intimate knowledge of weaknesses in IRS enforcement. And in particular, that temporary head could make a big headache go away from one very influential person, hedge fund billionaire and Breitbart investor Robert Mercer. In a too-little noticed McClatchy piece last month, it was reported that “The Internal Revenue Service is demanding a whopping $7 billion or more in back taxes from the world’s most profitable hedge fund, whose boss’s wealth and cyber savvy helped Donald Trump pole-vault into the White House.” The IRS demand is hardly controversial, as Mercer’s Renaissance Technologies attempts to use an obviously problematic loophole to pretend that’s its rapid-fire trading constitutes long term investing that is taxed at a far lower rate. Since polling suggests that wealthy individuals escaping their tax bill are more likely to be considered “unpatriotic” than “smart,” sticking a wrench in the gears of the IRS seems outright treasonous. So while continuing to monitor Trump-Russia, we need to also seek to limit the damage to the country from Trump’s problematic and seemingly purposeful mismanagement of the IRS that even his own Treasury Secretary knows is wrong. And while we monitor the IRS’ budget, we also need to be on the watch for a potentially catastrophic revolving door personnel pick to head the IRS after Koskinen’s term expires in November.",relationship,is,IRS
"Like other Democratic voters, I was painfully disappointed by the result of the 2016 US Presidential election. Though the pain may be slowly abating, there is a palpable unease that transcends politics and preferences. It feels as if some sort of decay is festering in the soul of America. The decay seems to have taken root almost without our notice over the course of many years, but in the aftermath of the election we can no longer deny that it exists. Our country is in deep moral distress, and we must wake up and pay attention.

 A significant portion of the electorate in this election chose to override ethics and ideals for the sake of political and personal expediency. A number of reasons have been cited to justify this behavior. The ultimate truth is that we have allowed anger, fear and prejudice to override our moral values. This is politics as usual, we might argue. However, the ugly voices of blatant racism, hate, lies, prejudices, misogyny and uncouth behavior were blaring and screaming at us like never before but we chose to ignore them for the sake of personal convenience. This will have consequences. I do not claim to be a moral or pious person, but from my personal experience, I know in my heart that when I disregard ethics for personal advantage, this has karmic effects.

We have voted into power an administration that reflects our fatal flaw: a reckless willingness to disregard ethical principles for the sake of power and convenience. What are some of the immediate dangers?

First, because the incoming administration during its campaign consorted with and appeased hate groups for the sake of votes, they are beholden to them. Whosever approval you seek, you become their prisoner.    

Second, in an environment of public apathy, polarization, sensation-seeking media, and an incoming administration that does not value integrity, our democratic institutions are in danger of eroding and declining. When the roots are weak, the sapling withers.

Third, we are regressing into the backwaters of history by wanting to make America great through domination and power. We are like the unthinking man with the proverbial hammer who sees every problem as a nail to be hammered down. Alas, we learn from history that we do not learn from history.

Is there no silver lining in this watershed election? Yes, there is! The shock effect of this election has been galvanizing, Many of us have awakened from our slumber and indifference, eager to take responsibility and become engaged as never before. It is heartening to find so many individuals and groups in neighborhoods, schools, organizations, and houses of worship asking how we can move forward in ways that preserve our ideals of humanity and serve the common good. The cliché ""We are the ones we have been waiting for"" has become a heartfelt rallying cry.

As an example, some members of Interfaith Community Sanctuary have responded by meeting regularly to determine what we can do in this time of uncertainty. They have committed themselves to practicing five essential steps involving inner and outer work.

Inner work

 1. Honor the difficult feelings that have been aroused by recent events. All feelings, positive or negative, are simply energies begging our attention. Embrace with compassion the feelings of pain, sadness, fear and anger. Acknowledge, heal and integrate them. Through spiritual practices such as sacred holding, fear transforms into mindfulness; anger into vitality; sadness into compassion.
Become aware of negative imaginary scenarios swirling in your mind. The collective mental environment is already rife with thought vibrations of anger and anxiety. Don't add to the mental pollution and become overwhelmed or despondent. Diminish the overload of negative vibrations through practices such as Neti! Neti!

2. Let go of self-righteousness. Be humble. Do not let the hellish fires of anger flare up when you witness injustice and prejudice. Stand your ground and speak up truthfully, but guard against arrogance and do not add to the problem by speaking or acting with violence.

 3. With humility and compassion examine your own prejudices and stereotyping of the other.  Strive to overcome them. As a South Asian Sunni Muslim, for instance, I need to acknowledge and try to counteract several biases that exist in my culture, including the unequal status of women, prejudice against darker skin, and pettiness towards other Muslim sects such as Shia or the Ahmadiyya community.

Outer Work

4. Bond with groups who have been marginalized in this election, and with those who support those groups. All over the country there are calls to gather and unite. Start locally and meet often. Bond in friendship. Personal relationships will cement a united front. Share feelings, collaborate with other groups, and plan necessary action. Make a commitment not to compromise on social justice issues and earth care, and to support one another in times of threat and intimidation.

It is critical to reiterate that without friendship and inner work on self, the united front will crack. Over time, we shall be tested. Will Muslims continue their unity with Jewish groups if a conflict breaks out in the Middle East between Israelis and Palestinians? Will Muslims move beyond conditioned biases and work with LGBTQ groups?

 5. The most critical step in our outer work is to connect with the other, in this case, the Trump supporter. We simply must move beyond our polarization. This work is long overdue. We must learn to bond on a human level, share human stories, and sustain a heart connection with people who do not share our political views. The work requires us to be humble, sincere and persistent as we share the proverbial three cups of tea: listening, respecting, and connecting.

Some members of our congregation have already reached out to Trump supporters. Suspicion and distrust are slowly abating on both sides and subtle shifts in thinking are occurring. Already the tendency to demonize or dehumanize the other has drastically reduced. Differences in political ideologies remain but they no longer loom as a threat. Amazingly, friendship and goodwill create a space where parties can join hands and collaborate on issues dear to both hearts: projects of social justice for instance.

Finally, have faith in the workings of a Greater Being, whether you call it God, Spirit, Higher Intelligence, the Universe, or any other name that your belief system allows. In our human existence of mystery and bewilderment, we are not privy to the larger story. The Universe wants us to learn from the enigmatic turns and twists of life's circumstances. ""Never lose hope, dear heart,"" utters Rumi, ""miracles dwell in the Invisible,"" and ""even if the whole world turns against you, keep your eyes on the Friend.""

Know that Divinity has a sense of humor. Were we not stunned beyond belief when a man of mixed race with a Muslim middle name was placed in the White House? Did we ever think this was possible in our lifetime? Are many of us not stumped, again beyond belief, that a person who unabashedly spouted prejudice of every kind, a polar opposite in many ways, has been elected President of the US? Did we think this could be possible in the Twenty-first Century? There are some lessons we need to learn through the experience of opposites. Rumi explains this phenomenon through a metaphor: God turns us from one feeling to another so that we might have two wings with which to fly, not one.

Above all, we must not succumb to feelings of powerlessness as we watch many flawed and unqualified personalities being appointed to positions of power. Instead, let us empower ourselves by persisting in both inner, spiritual work and outer, interpersonal connections. It is not enough to just throw up our hands and hope that God will save the day. A Bedouin once asked the Prophet before entering the mosque to pray, ""Should I tie my camel to the post or trust in God alone."" The Prophet replied, ""First tether your camel to the post, then trust in God.""",This,have,consequences
"Emily Knecht takes photos of herself pouting. But she’s not puckering her lips sensually, or posing for followers in a way that’s conventionally attractive. Knecht’s selfies aren’t of the promotional or confidence-building variety. They’re a running log of every time she’s cried in the past three years.  “At first it started as a reaction. A way to deal with difficult feelings,” Knecht, a professional photographer, told The Huffington Post. “Then it became documentation of a period of my life, and a period of my life turned into a series.” Her work is currently on display at Innocnts gallery, where black-and-white tearful moments are displayed alongside full-color, post-shower cries. Although the pictures weren’t taken with her phone –- they were shot on heavier duty cameras –- they have the same offhand effect experienced when thumbing through selfies on Instagram. For dramatic effect, Knecht illuminates her face with a bright flash.  And because she shoots her selfies with a film camera, Knecht isn’t able to see what they look like until she develops the images. “They’re meant to be honest and emotional depictions, and I find that selfies are often not,” Knecht said. “I think that the majority of selfies are taken to make oneself look and feel good -- a sexy pose, a purposeful gaze or a lip pucker. These images are much more raw -- you can often see blemishes on my face, they’re taken from straight on which isn’t always the most flattering angle.” Knecht is one of many young, female artists using the medium of self-portraiture to illustrate and subvert the way we interact with social media. Her work recalls the zoomed-out selfie portraits of Petra Collins, and the feminist artist Molly Soda, who recently leaked her own nude portraits. Apparently, selfies are no longer just about narcissism and heavily filtered self-portrayals, but also about unedited, raw portrayals of the grittier side of life.  You can see Emily Knecht's work on her personal portfolio.

"Once it became clear Tuesday night that Don Blankenship would not be a Republican nominee for U.S. Senate, a jubilant Betty Harrah logged onto Facebook to show her gratitude to her fellow West Virginians. “For the first time in 8 years I feel like dancing,” Harrah wrote. “Thanks everyone that did not vote for a certain person.” Harrah has been living the last eight years with the Upper Big Branch mining disaster weighing on her. Her brother, Steven Harrah, along with 28 other men,  died in the 2010 catastrophe in Montcoal, West Virginia. A series of investigations found that the disaster could have been prevented had the mine’s owner, Massey Energy, not routinely skirted safety regulations and put profits before miners’ lives. The credible Senate run made by Blankenship, Massey’s unrepentant former chief executive, has made the Upper Big Branch tragedy feel like yesterday to Harrah and other families who lost loved ones. But his third-place finish behind Rep. Evan Jenkins and victor Patrick Morrisey in Tuesday’s primary restored their faith in their fellow voters, knowing that a candidate who served a year in prison on a conspiracy conviction was rejected. “It was relief,” Harrah said Wednesday morning. “Just to know we don’t have to look at him anymore.”   Despite investigators’ findings, Blankenship has never taken responsibility for what happened at Upper Big Branch. Instead, he has propagated conspiracy theories, blaming the government for his workers’ deaths and his prosecution, and claimed the explosion was the result of an influx of natural gas in the mine. Investigators found the explosion’s central cause was excessive coal dust that Massey failed to keep in check. Apparently not enough voters bought Blankenship’s claims about Upper Big Branch, or his insistence that he’d bring more jobs back to the state’s coal fields, to send him into a general election against Sen. Joe Manchin (D). Blankenship received 20 percent of the GOP primary vote, compared with Jenkins’ 29 percent and Morrisey’s 35 percent. To Tommy Davis, who worked at Upper Big Branch and survived the blast, Blankenship’s campaign was an insult he couldn’t escape, seeing him on television and hearing his voice over the radio in ads the millionaire paid for. The disaster took Davis’ son, Cory Davis; his brother, Timmy Davis; and his nephew, Joshua Napper. On Wednesday morning, Davis was looking forward to moving on.  “I’m feeling awesome,” he said.  In the weeks ahead of the primary, Davis was telling anyone who would listen not to vote for Blankenship, that the man put money before human life and should not represent West Virginia. Davis even confronted Blankenship at a Republican meet-and-greet, telling him he was to blame for the deaths at Upper Big Branch.  Nervous about Blankenship’s supposed surge late in the campaign, Davis spent Tuesday turkey hunting in the woods, trying to stay off the internet and away from the television until the final results came in.  “I think West Virginia sent him a message last night that he’s not wanted here,” Davis said. “Hopefully he’ll pack his stuff and go back to Las Vegas,” where Blankenship maintains his primary residence. “If not, I’ll keep hounding him,” David added. The Upper Big Branch disaster made Blankenship the face of greed and recklessness for many West Virginians. In 2016, he was convicted of one misdemeanor charge of conspiring to violate mine safety laws ― a charge not directly connected to the mining deaths ― leading to his one-year sentence at a federal prison in California. Republican leaders all the way up to President Donald Trump urged voters to reject the disgraced coal baron ― not because he led a company that systematically endangered workers, but because they felt he would be a weak candidate in a general election. Trump won West Virginia by a whopping 42-percentage-point margin in 2016, which makes the GOP hopeful it can snatch the Senate seat from Manchin with the right challenger. On the eve of the primary, Trump tried to remind his fellow Republicans of the cautionary tale of Roy Moore, the far-right candidate who won the Alabama GOP primary but later lost the general election after The Washington Post reported that he’d pursued sexual relationships with teenage girls. “Don Blankenship... can’t win the General Election in your State... No way!” Trump tweeted Monday. “Remember Alabama.”  Robert Atkins believes the president’s tweet influenced the primary. Atkins lost his son Jason at Upper Big Branch. During the campaign, he made a point of going to Blankenship’s events in order to speak directly to undecided voters and rebut Blankenship’s claims about what happened at the mine. When there were no campaign events, he went anywhere there were crowds ― like local baseball games ― to urge people to vote against Blankenship. Atkins said he was happy to see the primary results, though he doesn’t believe Blankenship will quietly go away, even after a decisive loss. West Virginia election law has a “sore loser” provision that prevents someone who lost a primary from running as an independent in the general election. Still, Blankenship could feasibly urge voters to cast write-in votes for him, or launch another bid in the next election cycle.  If the coal baron stays in politics, Atkins said he will continue speaking out. “As long as there’s a chance of his face being in the picture, I’m going to hurt him all I can hurt him,” Atkins said. “He wants to clear his name. He can’t live with having that burden on his shoulders, but he was responsible for what happened.” ",Blankenship,pack,residence
"Anika Larsen and Jessie Mueller, who co-starred in Broadway's ""Beautiful,"" teamed up for a tender version of James Taylor's ""You Can Close Your Eyes"" in this heartwarming video.  The duet can be found on Larsen's debut solo album, ""Sing You To Sleep,"" which was released in December 2014. Mueller, who nabbed a Tony Award for her performance as Carole King in the hit musical, will also be on hand to perform at Larsen's March 23 concert at New York's Birdland in celebration of the album's release.  Larsen, also a Tony nominee for her portrayal of Cynthia Weil in ""Beautiful,"" told The Huffington Post in an interview that her new album was, in many respects, the culmination of ""an extraordinary whirlwind of a year.""  ""A year and a half ago, I was really at the lowest place in my life,"" she said. ""On all the major fronts in my life -- professionally, romantically -- it felt like nothing was going right. I felt like I needed to quit the business, because it just felt like it was masochistic and ridiculous.""  Just days later, Larsen's agent called to tell her that she'd landed the role in ""Beautiful,"" which turned out to be a smash hit. It was through her dresser on the show that she was introduced to musician Freddie Maxwell, who appears on ""Sing You To Sleep."" The couple, who are now expecting their first child, married earlier this year.  Although the 12-song collection has been billed as a collection of lullabies, Larsen hopes adults will find ""Sing You To Sleep"" just as enjoyable as their kids.  ""I wanted it to be more Norah Jones than The Wiggles,"" she said. ""I really feel strongly that we don't need to dumb things down for children. My kid is going to be listening to Stevie Wonder.""

" Margaret Bowland working with Keise: Photo by Frank Turiano Margaret Bowland -- whose recent paintings are dreamlike and a bit supernatural -- is interested in how children make sense of the world. ""Children are born into the whirlpool of conflicting ideas making up the world in which they live,"" Bowland notes, ""but they don't know they truth of any of it."" As an artist, Bowland has kept her own childlike sense of wondrous confusion very much alive and for that reason her art generates a drama-filled parallel universe.  A sensitive, imaginative artist who has struggled both to make sense of and also to redeem her Southern Baptist upbringing, Bowland sees is fascinated by the idea of ""damaged beauty."" To create images exist apart from life's struggles -- while illuminating human vulnerability in the context of society and history -- Bowland works with carefully chosen models. Bowland's models are in a sense collaborators, providing the grace and humanity needed to center and anchor her stormy canvases.  In order to better understand the paintings on view in Bowland's current exhibition, Power, I recently interviewed Bowland and four of her models to understand how they work together.  Margaret Bowland: At the outset of this I want to say that I work both from live models and from photographs. When I begin with a model many photos are taken.  After looking though these photos I develop ideas.  Then the work begins, often from the photos themselves.  Of course, this is never enough and the models must be brought back in. I set up clothes often on mannequins I have acquired over the years. Sometimes I build mannequins from all kinds of things, from chicken wire and paper towels, even old dolls. I am drawn to the tangle of life, the beauty and the grace I find in people who struggle but cannot finally be annihilated. I place my beloved characters in a world I create that reveals the particular struggle of his or her life and then I watch while the very truth of each of them rises to meet me or anyone else who cares to look back. The word ""collaboration"" is the best one to use for the way that my paintings are developed. But the collaboration is of an odd sort. The person being painted doesn't sit down with me and discuss his or her conceptions of the work. It begins by my fixation on a particular person.  Dexter Wimberly: Photo by Frank Turiano Dexter Wimberly I first met Margaret five years ago at the Brooklyn Museum at a hosted event on the topic of building a collection of African American art. We were both in the audience and during the panel discussion I made a statement, then asked a question. Margaret was intrigued and we spoke. As an independent curator, I had attended the event out of curiosity, but didn't know who Margaret was when I met her and hadn't seen her work before meeting her. When I then visited her home, I realized she was one of the best painters I had ever met.  As our friendship developed, I never even considered having Margaret paint me: I try to stay at bit objective in my relationships with artists. About five years after we met Margaret asked if I would be in a painting along with my son Dylan. I knew her history of painting young people and trusted that she would be respectful and mindful, so I had no issues saying ""yes."" I knew she could tell a different kind of story with a father and son, as Margaret has mainly painted women before.   Tangled up in Blue,  2015, Oil on linen, 70 x 98 inches We started with a photo session in which I was  covered in blue paint. I poured paint into my hands, onto clothing my clothing and moved it around so as to be covered in it. It was a bit extreme as I was wearing really nice clothing. Still, there was still a certain dignity about it that I knew would come through. The message has of the painting has to do with the passing on of knowledge and I think it came through in the finished painting. I really think Margaret said and did something in this work that she hadn't done or said before.  Justin Bullock: Photo by Frank Turiano Justin Bullock I met Margaret through a photographer who I met on a shoot for Faded Royalty, a men's clothing line. The experience of posing for Margaret was both intimate and graceful. Since I had never posed for a painter before, I was a bit intimidated. That being said, I immediately felt comfortable in Margaret's presence. She made me feel welcome, appreciated, and most importantly beautiful. She made me look very strong and powerful. Her imagery of me was especially poignant and I think she chose me as her subject for a specific reason: being Albino I experience racism more than most people do, from all races. Margaret Bowland In learning about his particular past, I learned that Justin is the child of two albino parents, I began by making drawings of him smoking. Then he observed a painting in the studio of a model covered in white paint and wanted to wear make up as well. I let him choose make up colors. First he chose gold and then I saw the Batman bracelet he always wears and I offered him a dish of black makeup. He put his hands into it and applied it where he wished. At first, he wanted to emulate Batman and then he kept going.   I just tried to hang on and do the best I could to record what was happening, I knew what I was painting was a painting about the complexity of race but I wished it to be a fact that the viewer arrived at through time. First you see this beautiful golden boy, then see that he has coated his hands in black paint and applied them to his body.  Only after another moment do you begin to see that his features, the texture of his hair, convey to you that he is an albino African American.  Through this process I want the viewer to think of what it is he or she really thinks about the relevance of the color of skin. The issue of race, the color of someone's skin is one of the first visual facts our mind records.  And in that second, a door opens and a rush of information fills our unconscious. The conscious mind must then fight past this onslaught to get back to apprehending the person standing before us. We may know these conditioned reactions to be false; we may despise that they exist, but we live within a culture that has created this as the very atmosphere in which we breathe.   Nakedness Has no Color and Knows no Border, 2015, Oil on linen, 82 x 70 inches  Matthew Davis: Photo by Frank Turiano Matthew Davis I met Margaret one day by Grand Army Plaza. I was cycling around the park with my friends Nickev and Sherquan and she stopped and asked if I was interested in modeling. She gave me her card and after I researched her I agreed to model. Honestly, at first it felt awkward but after awhile I got to know her better and I felt more relaxed. Margaret made me feel like I could be myself.  When I saw the finished painting I was amazed, happy and shocked at how well the painting came out and how. Her theme has so much meaning in the world that we live in today: Power. Margaret Bowland One day I was walking in the Park near my house on Memorial Day and as I approached the path that would lead back to my house I looked up and saw Matthew Davis. I did not know his name at the time.  He was just a beautiful young man on a bike and the way he looked back at me, his great height and the rise of the ground conjured up in my memory the way it felt to be on horseback looking across at another rider. I looked past his handlebars and there was his childhood friend, Sherquane, equally beautiful and mounted on a bike. The sight of them lifted me back into the great beauty of the world. I walked up to the boys, asked them to model for me  and we made a time to meet in my studio, with their bikes. I had a friend, Frank Turiano, come into my studio at the given time and photograph the boys as I directed and moved them and the bikes about. I did this two more times and was not getting what I needed no matter how hard I tried, no matter how much we interacted. I wanted that feeling of mounted riders and was not getting it.   And then I found myself alone with Matt one afternoon while he was waiting for a friend. We were talking and then he turned from me as if looking out the window. When he looked back at me I could see that tears were streaming down his face and he began to tell me of the funeral service he had to attend that week. Two months back, a kid he had grown up with had caught a stray bullet from a drive by shooting.   Matt told me that he had been there and that the police and EMT trucks arrived very quickly. He then said he had stood there, pacing with anxiety while it took the ambulance 30 minutes to drive away.  He looked back at me, his face full of tears and asked me why?  ""Why did it take them so long to leave?""  I had no answer but the obvious one, Matt lives in a poor neighborhood. His friend, whom he had talked to in the hospital the night of the shooting, whom Matt believed would be fine, never left the hospital. He died three weeks later of complications.   Matt looked to me, an adult, for the answer. He was terrified of seeing the boy's mother at the funeral because Matt felt responsible. He kept asking himself over and over why he had not done anything?  Why had he not spoken to the cops, the ambulance personnel and demanded that they get his friend to the hospital. I knew, of course, that no one would have listened to him that night.  And as I talked to him, trying to remove the guilt on his young shoulders and place it back upon the white establishment I represent, I watched as he shook his beautiful head, watched as his eyes darted in terror and then grabbed on to a smile, saying: ""Thanks, I am better, that's just life."" Then his friend came and the two left. Matt and I live two miles from each other at most. A park separates us. The neighborhoods on both sides are mixed racially now, but as Matt was growing up, a black child, his mother had stressed upon him the fear of going onto the streets of the side of the park in which I live, even as I had stressed the same fear upon my children as to the danger possible if they ventured into his neighborhood.  Matt is 6' 5inches tall. And yet the first time he came to my studio he had asked me to meet him at the park and together we walked the half block to my house.  Even after living in my home for 28 years, this was the first time I really understood that the fear families on both sides of that park had were mutual. When Matt left my house the day that he had broken down he was not ""better."" What I had seen in his face was a reckoning with the truth that had resulted in the neglect of his friend dawn on his face and then get driven back down within him.  His youth and his beauty supply him with the hope and sheer momentum now that keeps truth at bay. Just like all soldiers, who are always young and anxious to board planes to adventure, we know where those planes lead. I had just seen, twice, the movie ""Straight Out of Compton"" and as I sat there with Matt scenes from that movie and a Poussin painting in the Met where the golden armor of the soldiers feels oddly made of their own skin, collided and the first of the paintings of Matt was revealed to me. The next time he and his friend Sherquane came I had them pour gold body paint upon themselves to emulate the Poussin soldiers, and had one wear a necklace made out of five dollar bills to resemble the gold braided necklaces worn in ""Straight Out of Compton."" Neither of these high school students has one thing to do with the drug trade at all. But I had come to see that they all believed themselves to be soldiers in a world in which they had been raised in an atmosphere of wariness. And the only way out is through  gold, through money. Both boys want to become fashion models and even as I work with them to give them photos for their ""books"" I know how brutal that world is and how easily it chews up and discards thousands of beautiful kids every single year. So I made my first painting about them and called it Gilt. Yes I am playing on the double meaning of the word but am also asking the viewer to see that even though the main character, Matt, is covered in gold, believing it to be a protective armor his face still shows you what I saw the day he cried in my home, great vulnerability that is not overcome but held in check.  His eyes show you what this costs him and the sheer courage he is capable of finding within himself.  He is a soldier on a battlefield that is a stacked deck. For me, his courage amidst this tragedy that is real life, is Beauty.   Beauty is being exactly who you are amidst all that the world does to fracture and destroy you.  Beauty is courage that some people are born possessing. They do not even know that there is an option called giving up. They hold amidst it all. This is the common denominator in every person I paint. There are no common physical attributes, just this courage. This courage is grace and I know when I am in its presence. My job is to record it.  Gilt, 2015, Oil on linen, 51 x 74 inches  Julia Harrison: photo by Frank Turiano Julia Harrison Margaret is a friend of my family. She asked me to model for her, and I have been for a couple of years. Posing for Margaret is always wonderful because she is easy to relax around and has a big, warm personality. Being a (small) part of the creation of Margaret's artwork is also interesting; I feel as though I have learned a lot about her process just from listening to her and the photographer talking, and from being in her studio. Margaret has a very specific eye for detail; often she'll make changes in my posture or pose that feel miniscule. During the opening for Power a lot of people asked me the question, ""What is it like to be in a painting?"" I had a lot of trouble responding to this because it has always been clear to me, especially upon seeing it, that it may be a painting of me, but it isn't a painting about me. I love the painting, but I recognize that the girl in the painting is Margaret's interpretation of my identity, and therefore the girl is more Margaret than she is me. That said, the painting feels very real and honest to me.  15 in 2015, 2015, Oil on linen, 60 x 60 inches Margaret Bowland I have known a beautiful child, Julia Harrison, for most of her 15 years. She has become preposterously beautiful. She is almost six feet tall, looks like Grace Kelly and is brilliant. This is a young woman for whom no one on earth feels anything but envy. A request for compassion for Julia would bring a smile to someone's face. And yet that very fact reveals the paradox of her need. Julia is like a niece to me. I have watched her develop into this paragon of womanhood warily. I know the world will weigh what she has been given and exact retribution. I put white makeup on her fair face, just as women have been doing in every culture in the world for centuries. I had her hair arranged on her head in the manner of an 18th century lady complete with the white paint and powder that would have been placed on Marie Antoinette, or Josephine, or Queen Elizabeth the 1st. These women were all turned into blank slates upon which the crowd could project its needs, for purity, or lust or even what it thought to be love. But beneath this mask lived a real woman who was never seen, never known.  I then placed Julia in a turbulent sea up to her neck, her hand trying to pull away the ribbon that such women wore around their necks. The sea in which she struggles fades in deep space into the sea of Turner's The Slave Ship. in her hair are the flowers that would have been arranged upon the head of any great lady of the 18th century but they are made of 100 dollar bills. Those bills carry the image of Benjamin Franklin, the ambassador to France when women were so attired. Overhead are American fighter jets that are igniting the flowers in Julia's hair and fly over the slaves drowning in the water below. This is the world into which Julia was born. For all her good fortune, she still lives in a world that carries this baggage. She was born in this sea. The innocent die every day in wars we conduct and young women are still asked to become projection screens in order to be loved. Margaret Bowland: Power

"To be a cog in the corporate machine is to subject yourself to injustices large and small in the name of eking out a living: tiresome office politics, a jammed printer, a stolen lunch, or worse, sexual harassment. Just look at the seminal “9 to 5,” “Office Space,” “The Office” and “Corporate,” all pop cultural depictions that draw on the inescapable ennui of zombielike number-crunchers and buttoned-up executive assistants who subsist on burnt coffee and keyboard cleaner, waiting for the day their crappy co-workers and abusive bosses get their due.  Netflix and Sanrio’s new anime series “Aggretsuko,” which debuted on the streaming service on Friday, takes the mundane workplace frustration many of us have come to know and cranks the dial to 11. The series follows Retsuko, an endearing red panda who wants nothing more than to get through her work days without incident. And when real life doesn’t measure up to her hopes, she turns to the only thing that temporarily soothes her discontent: death metal.  There’s a lot for Retsuko to get angry about. She works in accounting for some vague corporate entity, one of several lackeys made to tidy the desk of her rage-inducing boss, a literal chauvinist pig. She heads to the office in an overstuffed commuter train, only to have to face a rumor-spreading hippopotamus and a Komodo dragon who loves to dump extra work on her. She faces small, relatable dilemmas outside her job, too: feeling conflicted over how much to give for a wedding present, or simply wanting to shop without constant check-ins from a store clerk.  She gets by thanks to her work buddies — a chill fennec fox with unmatched social-media stalking skills and a hyena in slacks (who, based on Twitter’s consensus, seems to be the most crush-worthy character). She’s in awe of two more experienced colleagues, women who strut down the hallways with an air of #girlboss assuredness, but who actually share many of our titular hero’s insecurities. Retusko channels all of this insecurity and rage into a death-metal hobby that lets her express exactly how she feels. She tries to hide it first from her more intimidating female co-workers and then from a love interest, but realizes her truest self lies within these moments. It’s in these small vignettes where Retsuko is able to be fully unvarnished: “You’re a shitty boss!” she scream-sings during a work happy hour. “Death metal is my soul!!!” she confesses in another episode. The sharp contrast between Retsuko’s adorable outward appearance and her unbridled rage-singing is played for laughs in each of the series’ 10 episodes, yet doesn’t become tiresome. Perhaps because it’s rare to see a female character, animated or not, succumb fully to her anger, especially in a way that’s seen as a net positive. Retsuko’s metal habit provides a private, nondestructive space to contend with the pitfalls of an early-career slog. Requiring a standing appointment at a karaoke bar might be self-care taken to its most extreme, but Retsuko isn’t a role model. She’s just trying to make it through her 20s. The lyrics of Retsuko’s throat-murdering screams are the cherry atop her rage sundae, adapting to fit her crisis du jour. In one episode, she determines that all she needs is a wealthy partner to escape her current drudgery. Cue the metal guitars, and the passionate cry of future financial security: “MATRIMONIAL FREEDOM!” It’s good. American audiences might not immediately associate the show with Sanrio, the Japanese company best known for Hello Kitty. Retsuko, along with Sanrio’s listless egg character Gudetama, stand out from the company’s other happily uncomplicated creations by virtue of their issues. Even Retsuko’s resting “cute” face lacks a smile. The full-length series, inspired by shorts that aired on Japan’s Tokyo Broadcasting System network, hits on an interesting spot. It feels intended for an audience older than do kid-adult crossovers like “Adventure Time” or “Steven Universe.” Yet its lightness — despite all its rage — doesn’t feel quite in line with the darker adult-cartoon stalwart (and fellow Netflix original) “BoJack Horseman.” Still, it’s pointed enough to feel true to life, even if heavy metal isn’t your genre. The series is generally self-aware, of the moment and endearingly weird: Retsuko’s fennec fox friend, for example, details a pattern in their co-worker’s Instagram feed, nailing down her routine of food, selfie and occasional “thigh shot” pictures. But the office caricatures aren’t always charitable. That same ’gram-friendly co-worker, a starry-eyed doe who talks in a baby voice, also allows the gross boss to flirt with her to her benefit. She’s clearly set up as a contrast to Retsuko and company — surely they’d never stoop so low — but her overly ditzy depiction feels a little one-note at first. Each episode is a short 15 minutes, putting “Aggretsuko” in the ranks of Netflix’s other feel-good original fare that requires minimal time commitment (looking at you, “Nailed It”). The effect of catching a handful in one sitting is like having read several culturally savvy comic strips: bright colors, enough for a laugh, but not a lot of narrative depth. Fortunately, “Aggretsuko” isn’t trying for prestige television; it succeeds as a cathartic mirror to contemporary office life — and the activities that sustain us once we’ve punched out.   Looking for more streaming recommendations?

"Guests on the “Dr. Phil” show who struggle with addiction have been supplied with drugs and alcohol before appearing on set for taping, according to a joint investigation between Stat and The Boston Globe published Thursday. In one shocking example, “Survivor: China” winner Todd Herzog told reporters he appeared on the program drunk as he was dealing with alcoholism in 2013. Herzog said he found a liter of Smirnoff vodka in his dressing room, which he consumed, and was later handed a Xanax pill by a staffer to “calm his nerves.” The show, hosted by the no-nonsense Southerner Phil McGraw, has been on-air since 2002, but McGraw gained a following with appearances on “The Oprah Winfrey Show” before then. During the episode with Herzog, who had to be assisted onstage, McGraw said he had “never talked to a guest who was closer to death.” A family member of another guest told reporters their relative “bought heroin with the knowledge and support of show staff” before a taping. The report also states that “Dr. Phil” staff filmed another guest, who was pregnant, searching for a dealer on Los Angeles’ skid row. Reporters note that the alleged actions of staffers can make for “riveting” television, but the show’s guests, who stay in hotels up to 48 hours before taping an episode, can experience a possibly dangerous withdrawal period during that time. In a statement published online Friday, a spokesperson for the “Dr. Phil” show slammed the story as “unsubstantiated.” “The STAT article does not fairly or accurately describe the methods of the ‘Dr. Phil’ show or its mission to educate millions of viewers about drug and alcohol addiction,” the statement read. “The show does not give drugs or alcohol to its guests and any suggestions to the contrary are errant nonsense.” A psychologist who works for the show, Martin Greenberg, also denied the claims in the original report. In a statement provided to Stat and the Globe, he said that “addicts are notorious for lying, deflecting and trivializing.”  “But, if they are at risk when they arrive, then they were at risk before they arrived,” the statement continued. “The only change is they are one step closer to getting help, typically help they could not have even come close to affording.” Guests dealing with addiction are typically helped with referrals to treatment facilities. According to the report, a mutually beneficial relationship between the “Dr. Phil” show and McGraw’s own business interests — namely a digital treatment program available for purchase by treatment facilities — may have contributed to the alleged abuse.  McGraw holds a doctorate in psychology but let his license to practice expire more than a decade ago. Over his television career, he’s faced criticisms and lawsuits for his approach to mental health, which the National Alliance on Mental Illness once called “serious enough to warrant investigation by a relevant board of licensure,” following a 2004 segment in which he diagnosed a 9-year-old boy as a potential killer. The syndicated show is popular with women ages 25 to 54, a key daytime TV advertising demographic. HuffPost reached out to a representative for McGraw but did not immediately receive a response.  This story has been updated with comment from a “Dr. Phil” spokesperson.",give,are,contrary
"It was April 1997 when doctors told Austin Prario’s parents that their newborn son might not live to see his first birthday. Nearly 20 years later, the Rhode Island native has not only proven that prediction wrong ― he’s completed the 121st Boston Marathon. Prario made his way across the finish line of the race on Monday as cheers erupted from the crowd. His doctors believe he may be the first person with his type of heart condition to complete the famously challenging 26.2-mile race, which he finished in just over 6 hours and 14 minutes. Congratulations to Austin Prario who just completed his first marathon! All of us at @BostonChildrens are proud of you! #CHD #BostonMarathon pic.twitter.com/uRDUEFs3Xe Prario was born with a rare congenital heart defect that prevents the muscle’s fourth chamber from functioning properly, meaning his heart might operate at 75 percent of its capacity or less under stress. “[Doctors] told us that with surgery, Austin could lead a normal life, but that he would never be a varsity athlete or be able to finish something like the Boston Marathon,” Prario’s dad, Dave Prario, told Runner’s World earlier last week. That message didn’t sit well with him. He was determined to have his son cross the Boston Marathon finish line one way or another. In 1998, Dave Prario ran the Boston Marathon to raise money for the Boston Children’s Hospital, which had diagnosed his son just one year earlier. He carried the 1-year-old boy across the finish line while wearing a shirt that read “You gotta have heart!” Austin Prario had a difficult first 18 months of life, undergoing three open heart surgeries that left him with a scar running the length of his chest. Nevertheless, he defied his doctors’ predictions for his life and became an avid athlete and sports fanatic. He ran cross-country in elementary school ― despite losing every race ― and went on to play a few sports in high school. Today, he’s a sophomore at Community College of Rhode Island and an assistant track coach at a local high school. Prario made the decision to follow in his father’s footsteps last summer. His cardiologist OK’d the ambitious endeavor, recommending at least two years of training to prepare. But he didn’t want to wait any longer. Less than a year of training later, Austin has defied all odds. He completed the course by early Monday afternoon before taking another finish line photo next to his dad, who ran the race as a guide for mobility impaired runners. Amazing moment- 19 yr old Austin is the first person to ever run Boston Marathon with 3 heart chambers @abc6 pic.twitter.com/409CESiGRw Prario also raised more than $17,000 for Boston Children’s Hospital to honor the doctors who saved his life ― and was 90 percent toward his $20,000 goal as of Monday afternoon. “This is for all the people that said I could do it and for all the people that said I couldn’t,” he told Runner’s World last week. “I only have one life and doctors fixed it to the best of their ability. Why not show them everything I can do with it?”",I,have,ability
"I've noticed that when I'm depressed, I feel ugly. The two seem to travel together, a sinister, awkward pair like Cinderella's step sisters.  It doesn't help that depression makes me tired, which makes me less inclined to exercise, which makes me less inclined to give a rat's ass about what I put into my mouth, which makes me less inclined to fit into my pants, which makes me a little more depressed. It doesn't help that sometimes my face is raccoon eyed and puffy from crying. It doesn't help that I'm achy and carrying myself a little but like I'm made out of glass and could shatter at the slightest provocation and the tension is so pronounced you can see it in the little veins throbbing in my nostrils.  No, none of that helps, But that really isn’t it, either. It's just that my filter, the normal part of me that is essential to being a woman in today's world, the part that reminds me on the daily how in the grand scheme of things ugliness has little to do with pants size or makeup or what any of us looks like and much more to do with what we are, is a teensy bit broken.  Broken is probably not even the right word for it, it's more like it's running low on juice and needs to be charged. It's still sending up little reminders to me, but instead of the loud and incessant alarm necessary to drown out all the other noise, they're quiet chirps like the smoke alarm on its last legs, easy to ignore and probably just as dangerous.  So I stand in front of my mirror in the morning and nurse my coffee, my head tilted to the side, and the chirps get lost in the chorus of self-doubt, a pool that's easy enough for any of us to drown in if we're not being careful.   Because that’s the thing, isn’t it? We have to actively be careful not to let that shit kill us. We have to walk around with our eyes wide open and notice the actual BEAUTY of the world, the things that matter, or we get incessantly stuck in the call of the things that don't, throwing money and time and so much effort after that crap that TV and magazine covers and every air brushed image that floats past our eyeballs a hundred times a day tells us is beauty that really isn't beauty at all, at least not the kind of beauty that matters when the lights go out, or when the years go by, or when we are feeling a little fragile and sad and need help.   When we need to reminded the most.  So if, like me, you need it, here's the reminder: TRUE BEAUTY IS IN EVERYTHING. It's all around us.  It's the sun, rising every morning even when the blanket of darkness was so heavy that we weren’t sure we were going to be able to breathe much longer underneath the weight of it.  It's the leaves, not only unafraid of falling but flaunting it in a brilliant show of celebratory color.  It's in the curve of the handle on the mug that holds my cheer, warm to the touch and handed to me by my husband who can't fix me but can fix me coffee.  It's the hugs of a hundred kids on a hundred nights, the little ones who fall asleep against my belly, still soft from them, and the bigger ones too who pad in after I've started to fall asleep and bend towards me just enough, the way a plant will bend slightly towards the sun, and whisper so quiet I will doubt it happened at all, ""I love you.""  It's the kindness of strangers and traffic and parking spots and shopping carts returned and doors held and the guy who notices that the floor is a little wet and warns me lest I fall and the lady who offers her hand when I fall anyway and the people who stop long enough to ask if I'm okay.  It's the way the radio knows enough to play something special and the way the moon knows to light the sky and the way the clouds know to part to let the geese in.  It's the way my meds take the edge off and I remember what okay felt like and get giddy with possibility and sing again, if only quiet for now, if only to myself.  It's the way my youngest wraps his arms around my legs and asks, innocent, ""Mama am I beautiful?""  And I look at him, my freshly four year old baby boy. His hair, never cut, falls to the middle of his back in gentle waves, exactly the hair I remember the new corn silk Cabbage Patch kid dolls having when I was a kid, when I begged and pleaded with my mother to get me one and instead she bought me the older model with the yarn hair. (Disappointing hair being the story of my life.) He has blue eyes, the same deep blue my mother had--crowned in crazy lashes that touch his cheeks when he closes them against me. There's a gap in between his teeth just big enough to be adorable and hopefully not big enough to require surgical intervention the way mine did. He's the most beautiful thing I have ever seen, of course, but it's not because of his hair or his eyelashes or his tooth gap. It's because he's here. Because he's pure and good and innocent and alive and full of light.  Just like my coffee, and my favorite song, and the sun and the moon and the leaves and the children. Just like us. Even Anastacia and Drizella—Cinderella’s stepsisters, that is—are beautiful, in the right light and with some distance. Plenty of distance. More. There you go.

"Bridging the gap from idea to implementation isn’t an easy feat. It’s a long, drawn out journey that encompasses chaos and navigates the individual battles of fear, self-defeating beliefs and other habits that hinder rather than help. I remember a BUD/S (Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL training) instructor telling us the secret to making it through BUD/S: Don’t quit. Don’t quit. That was it — “don’t quit.” It’s simple, it’s obvious and it’s almost patronizing to tell somebody that if they want to achieve something that they shouldn’t quit. Simple, yes. Easy, no. There’s one quality that separates winners from losers, one “thing” that 34 out of the 176 students from my BUD/S class chose to enact that the other 140 who failed chose against. You know what it was? Will. Individual will. Effort. People who get things done are willing to embrace the suck and keep coming back for more. People who get things done are willing to take a hit and keep on hitting. People who get things done know that just because they fail at something along the way, it doesn’t make them a failure. These are characteristics of people who get “stuff” done, and they do so because they’re willing to find pleasure amidst a whole hell of a lot of pain. Everybody has their own behaviors and habits that work for them. Whatever they are for you, keep them — but make them better. Don’t settle for what always works because it not always will. Here are six behaviors that I’ve found to yield positive results. Hopefully they will for you, too. It’s easy to uphold the promises you make to others. After all, you made a promise to them which means you’re now accountable to 1) them and 2) to that promise. But what about when you make a promise to yourself? Who holds you accountable then? It’s easier to break a promise made to yourself than it is a promise made to a friend because there’s no overwatch, no fear of social judgment. Hold yourself accountable for keeping promises to yourself with the same scrutiny that you do for others because when you do, you make deposits to what’s known as your “emotional bank account.” An emotional bank account is just that — a bank account of you that grows with promises kept and depletes with promises broken. The more promises you make to yourself and the more you keep them, the stronger your self-image builds. Your self-efficacy snowballs into an unstoppable force as you see yourself as the type of person who’s able and willing to conquer difficult tasks. Keep the promises you make to yourself even when nobody’s looking and you’ll build the type of mental fortitude that others wish they had; you’ll be the person others aspire to be. I don’t know about you, but the “good idea fairy” has a permanent room in my apartment. She sends her good ideas to me every day, even when I say, “Okay, enough is enough!” Having a great idea come to mind is, well, great, but also extremely frustrating when you can’t remember what it was. Don’t fret. Have a system for capturing those little strokes of genius as they happen in the moment so you can revisit them later. You’ll never change the world if you forget the ideas you had to conquer it (that’s a joke). When a new idea strikes you, capture it immediately. Make a voice note, send yourself an email, write any keywords that might spark your memory later on. Just. Don’t. Forget them. One thing that holds people back is the fear of social judgment. “What will others think of me if…?” It’s natural to compare yourself to others, but that doesn’t mean it’s right. After all, you don’t know their story, don’t know what drives them, what challenges them or what’s going on in their minds. Maybe they’re role modeling somebody else in the moment; somebody else they wished they were or some other role they wish they had. When you take yourself too seriously, what really happens is you place an inordinate amount of pressure on yourself to be received that way by others. However, what people think or feel about you is out of your control, which means that by expecting others to receive you as you perceive yourself, what you’re really doing is setting yourself up for failure (because you have no control). And if you’re thinking, “Well, if I don’t take myself seriously then nobody else will,” you’re right — why should they? If you need to tell people how “serious” or how great you are, it’s because they haven’t seen it yet for themselves. You can be “serious” (i.e. focused) while having fun. Nothing speaks to greater self-confidence than poking fun at yourself. It’s no secret that some of the most successful people stick to an exercise routine, and they do so in the morning. The thing is, they don’t workout to prep their beach bodies for summer (okay, maybe some do). Successful people know that by challenging the physical game, they strengthen the mental game. And the mental game is everything. Aim for just one percent improvement every day. By striving to get just one percent better every day, at the end of the year you will have improved 365%, or 3.5 times better than where you began. There’s a difference between “telling it like it is” and “telling it like it is as an ass.” Tell it like it is but do so with tact. Be mindful of yourself and how you “show up” to the conversation. Pay attention to other people’s reactions that follow your words and non-verbal cues, as those are great indicators to how you’re being received. Here’s another reason to be candid: it shows respect. If there’s one thing that we all need more of (and I could insert a lot of jokes right here), it’s time. Nobody has the time to listen to BS. Nobody has the time to dilly-dally around (i.e. waste time) on superfluous “stuff.” If you want to demonstrate respect or even reward people, offer them candor. Tell them like it is yet in a non-douchebag-way. Don’t waste time — theirs or yours. People appreciate candor. They want to know where they stand with you and with others. Social comparison is natural (just not accurate for the reasons cited in #3), so address their curiosity about “where they stand” before they even begin to wonder. Do this, and people will actively seek your feedback in the future because they know what they’ll get in return: honesty. Making things happen is one thing. Learning from what you made happen and then applying what you learned next time is another. If you’re not learning from mistakes (or successes for that matter), you’re dying a slow, painful death. Learning is what keeps you relevant. Competitive. On the cutting-edge. Have a process to learn. In the military, we conducted After Action Reviews after every major training event and every mission because they enabled us to build awareness about ourselves and each other (and nobody ever suffers from being “too aware”). The choices you make shape who you are today and guide you to who you will be tomorrow. Build yourself everyday by making it happen today. Originally published on Medium.

"(Adds power outage in Canada, NFL games, chicken soup) By Victoria Cavaliere NEW YORK, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Many parts of the U.S. Midwest  braced for a blast of Arctic air this weekend that could bring  some of the coldest temperatures in two decades before advancing  to the Northeast, where residents are still digging out from a  deadly snowstorm. Starting Sunday, the deep freeze will be felt in the  northern U.S. plains, including North and South Dakota, and  through the Great Lakes region and Ohio Valley, according to the  National Weather Service. It will be some of the coldest weather to grip the region in  two decades, with blizzard conditions expected in the Central  Plains and Great Lakes regions, forecasters said. ""The last really big Arctic outbreak was 1994,"" said Bob  Oravec, a forecaster with the National Weather Service.  ""Outbreaks like this don't occur every day."" In northeastern Canada, about 110,000 customers were without  power due to a transformer fire on Saturday linked to heavy  snow, government officials and Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro  said. The push of Arctic air could bring record low temperatures  from Montana to Michigan, before moving the Northeast, where it  will arrive by early Tuesday, forecasters said. Temperatures in Chicago could drop to about minus 20 (minus  29 Celsius). Pittsburgh could see temperatures about 11 degrees  below zero Fahrenheit (minus 24 Celsius) by early Tuesday. Temperatures were forecast to fall to 30 below in parts of  the north central United States early Sunday morning, and in  Grand Forks, North Dakota, wind chills were expected to exceed  50 below. A high of 19 below is forecast for Sunday. ""You grin and bear it and bundle up,"" said Rachel Osowski, a  clerk at Hugo's Supermarket in Grand Forks. ""You have to survive  and function, you can't let the weather stop you."" In such conditions, frostbite can set in on exposed skin  within five minutes, forecasters warned.                 CLOSED SCHOOLS Preparing for the dangerous weather, officials in several  states asked residents to use extra precautions when outdoors. Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton has ordered all public  schools in the state closed on Monday to protect children from  dangerously cold weather. Chicago schools will be open Monday despite the cold but  officials advised parents to ""use their own discretion in  deciding whether to send their child to school."" In Pittsburgh, the transition team for Mayor-elect Bill  Peduto said his inauguration ceremony on Monday would be moved  from the steps of the local government building to an indoor  venue because of the weather. Officials in Kentucky, which could see up to 8 inches (20  cm) of snow and freezing temperatures, were warning people to  avoid road travel and stay indoors. ""If you don't need to be out, stay in, stay home,"" said  Buddy Rogers, spokesman for Kentucky Emergency Management. Schools will remain closed in Nashville, Tennessee, until  Wednesday, a day after winter break was supposed to end, local  officials said. The storm comes on the heels of a massive weather system  that slammed the U.S. Midwest and Northeast just after New  Year's Day, causing several deaths, grounding thousands of  flights and forcing schools and government offices to close.                 MISSED FLIGHTS At the Best Western motel in Bemidji, Minnesota, some  drivers stopped for the night because of the cold, connecting  their cars to special heaters to keep the engines from freezing,  said motel manager Monica Horn. A total of 1,266 flights were canceled across the United  States and 6,036 flights delayed on Saturday, with Chicago's  O'Hare International Airport and Newark Liberty International  Airport in New Jersey among the most affected, according to  tracking firm FlightAware.com. Molly Cox, in New York City for New Year's Eve, said she  missed her Friday night flight home to Denver because LaGuardia  Airport was ""a disaster."" ""With all the cancellations, all of the airlines seem to be  having this kind of chaos,"" she said. Boston was especially hard-hit by the first major storm of  2014, logging about 18 inches (45 cm) of snow on Friday, while  some towns north of New England's largest city were dealing with  close to 2 feet (60 cm) of accumulated snow. But life has begun to return to normal in Boston. The city  lifted its snow emergency at 5 p.m. on Friday. New York City got about 7 inches (18 cm) of snow on Friday  and was slammed with overnight air temperatures hovering under  the freezing mark. Washington received more than 2 inches (5 cm)  of snow in the storm, Philadelphia roughly 5 inches (13 cm) and  Hartford, Connecticut 7 inches (18 cm). (U.S. snowfall:  link.reuters.com/zym75v)                 FOOTBALL AND CHICKEN SOUP In Green Bay, Wisconsin, the temperature plummeted to minus  18 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 28 C) on Friday, breaking a record  for the date set in 1979, according to the National Weather  Service. With the new frigid air moving in, a National Football  League wild card playoff game between the Green Bay Packers and  the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday at Green Bay's Lambeau Field  was expected to rank among the coldest matches on record, local  officials said. Some 40,000 tickets to the game have been sold, according to  the Packers. High-tech equipment, vigilant medical care and perhaps even  chicken soup will be on tap to combat the Arctic conditions, Dr.  Matthew J. Matava, head team doctor for the St. Louis Rams and  president of the National Football League Physicians Society,  told Reuters. ""A lot of sidelines will have warm chicken broth available.  It tastes good, it's going to be warm and help warm them  internally. It contains electrolytes and the sodium chloride  (salt) helps replenish electrolytes you lose in sweat,"" Matava  said.

"This is a very lightly edited transcript from a December meeting between New York Times editorial page editor James Bennet and a number of Times employees. For more, read our story about the meeting. James Bennet: So the op-ed page was created to do a bunch of different things. But it was partly because this other paper was going out of business, and the feeling — in this very New York-centric moment, The New York Times obviously was an entirely print-centric world — was, there’s nobody to keep us honest anymore. You know, we’ll take our positions and there’s nobody arguing the other side. And so the Times very deliberately went out to create a space in our own universe where there would be people taking the other side and where we would, again, be able to cover — and you can see this in the initial statement for the op-ed page — we engage with the culture, engage with a wide range of subjects. And that’s remained the goal of the page and the ecology of the opinion report over time. But what you’ve seen is the kind of regression to the mean, I think, that takes place. And in many ways we became more and more homogenous as the years went by. I mean, all the work was excellent. But I think a degree of sameness set in and to the point where it now — to grievously overstate the case, the idea of debate is, you have one guy for the Brookings Institution and one guy from the Council of Foreign Relations arguing in the page.  And we’ve conducted a number of — there have been a number of really important innovations in recent years, and I point to Op-Docs as really a central one. We can talk about that if you guys are interested. But in a lot of ways the world of opinion journalism has been, as you all know, undergoing a revolution over the course of the last 10 or 15 years. The Times hasn’t fully participated in it. So, what we’re trying to do now, and the sort of project we’re engaged in, is essentially to try — you can think of it as trying to diversify ourselves in four dimensions at the same time, or along four axes. The first is our team itself. So again, the columnists are the most visible representation of this. Each of them are excellent in their own ways and are fantastic as an array. They don’t necessarily represent our aspirations for our audience, let alone our ambition to capture the full range of — one can never capture the full range — but a wider range of the debate that’s out there. This is true of the department as a whole, and we are working towards diversifying our team.  We’re trying to diversify the ways we tell stories, and that’s about breaking out of the boxes that really still constrain us in the print paper, and the notion that what we do is editorials of 500 words and columns of 800 words and op-eds of maybe 900 words. It’s hard to overstate the degree to which that framework constrains us still ― although we’re beginning to push past it and think about other ways of opinionizing against the news. Longer, more deeply reported pieces, incorporating or leading with graphics and visual forms of opinion. And we’ve created a small video unit that’s doing, now, opinion journalism for us, led by Adam Ellick. So that’s story form, second category. Third category is subject matter — another way that we’ve kind of regressed to a mean, I think. Our default game in opinion is politics and global affairs. And that tends to dominate what we do. We’re going to be putting a much more deliberate focus on subject area and kind of diversifying our range of opinion to more deliberately engage with the world of technology, business and economics, and the culture. We can talk more about that if you want. And then the last component for it is ideological range, where I think both on the editorial line and our columnists and a lot of our op-eds were conducting a debate that was often between the 40-yard lines. And this was evident in the last campaign, where — the last presidential campaign, now I am talking about politics again — where, you know, there wasn’t really an advocate for the Bernie Sanders view of the world formally in our pages. And we’ve had fewer voices to the right for quite some time. Now, of all of this work, it’s that last thing I mentioned that’s getting the most attention and the most concern, and the most blowback. But what I’m trying to explain is, it is one element in everything we’re trying to do.  We’ve gotten a couple more — and I’m very grateful for — some investment in the company for a few more slots that’s helping us do this work. But it’s a fairly ambitious reset of the entire operation largely within our existing footprint, and it’s really hard on our people. I mean, you’re going through a lot of turbulence right now. And Tyson can testify to that. I think on the other side of that is a lot of excitement and fun and a real adventure as we kind of get people sorted and get a clear understanding of everything we’re up to, what the ambitions are, and can begin experimenting in a big way. But right now we’re in the thick of it. Sorry, I talked a lot longer than I meant to. That’s the overall — did I leave anything out?  NYT employee: Can I ask you a question? Can you talk about some of the things that you’re really most proud of, or some of the biggest things you feel like you’ve been able to do since you’ve been here? Even if maybe they’re the most challenging at the same time. Bennet: I wouldn’t say there’s anything I’m particularly proud of. I’m really grateful for the way that my colleagues have kind of risen to the occasion here. I mean, again, it’s been hard, because everybody’s job is changing, and our people just all lost their offices. I mean, talk about a first-class problem, but it is a problem. If you’re a columnist at The New York Times, part of what goes with that is you have an office. And one day, you get it taken away — and editorial board members, too. We still have members of the editorial board who lament the offices that we had on 43rd Street, which were sort of, I don’t know, baronial — fires in the [inaudible] and dogs on the floor, and somebody — anyway. I think there’s some work we’ve been doing lately, there’s been some pieces — our graphics team is super strong. It’s two people, basically, right now. But I can point you to some examples of specific pieces, like the big piece about the opening up of this last Alaskan wilderness that we were able to do in a really — we just didn’t have the ability to tell a story that way just a few months ago. And it was really dynamic and powerful. And we’re doing more of that kind of work more regularly. I’m super happy with the work that Michelle Goldberg is doing. She’s a columnist for us, and Lindy West, who’s another new — she’s a weekly voice that we’ve added. And when I imagine a counterfactual, which is, again, I don’t know if you guys have had time to read any of this stuff, I know we’re all super busy. But we’ve got a bunch more very strong — going through this Harvey Weinstein moment without them, we would have done some really good work, but when I try to imagine what that would have been like, it feels like our report would have been really impoverished. So in a way, both these things are sort of proof of concept to me of how much more exciting it’s going to be when we represent a wider range. I feel the same way about Bret’s work for us. I know that there was a lot of — and I experienced it — a lot of criticism and concern about him. And you guys may disagree or there may be people who do, but I just think he’s an exceptional writer and thinker. I don’t agree with him a lot of the time. But I like to read him, so. And one thing that’s hard here, by the way, is that among the things we’re asking of people is — and I’ve had this experience before elsewhere — is, it’s a really hard thing to ask people who disagree with each other to work with each other. You know? And particularly with opinion journalism, these are people who are paid to have very, very strong convictions, and to believe that they’re right.  And then you want to put them together and say, “OK now we want to treat each other civilly and be good colleagues.” And that can be a difficult thing. But again, people are, I think — and, Tyson, correct me if I’m wrong — they’re making it work. We’ve had some explosions, but culturally it’s real, it’s actually a challenge internally. And if you ask me what I’m proud of, I’m proud of the way people have — I was not proud of some of the moments along the way. But in general, I think people handled that with the grace and dignity we would expect from people at The New York Times. NYT employee: I’m keeping an eye on Slack in case there are questions, but I guess what I’ll ask you is that — so you alluded earlier to a lot of, sort of, sameness, you know, among the opinions, like, across the board in media previously. How do you feel like the Times is currently — in your opinion section, that you’re running — how is it differentiating itself from, say, other publications? Bennet: This is where we’re trying to get. If you, um... I think, in general, what we’ve seen is that there are not very many places that have the ambition of putting people with very different points of view into conversation with each other. That may be because it’s a bad idea. I think it’s also because it’s hard to do that. And other publications simply don’t have the same sense of purpose around this that The New York Times has. Particularly the digital upstarts that have come along. The startups, generally, and serious players over the course of the last 15 or 20 years tend to have a point of view on the world and drive that point of view through everything that they’re doing. In the print world, it’s the approach that The Economist has taken, and arguably, it’s kind of what The New Yorker is, in the print world. And if you imagine two axes — and this is Tyson’s visual representation of this — where you put digital and print on two of the extremes and a single point of view and many voices on the other, and you sort publications that way, what you find is that one quadrant is almost entirely empty, which is digital and lots of points of view. One exception to that is media, which is open to everybody and obviously not a curated space. When we think about the competitive landscape, if there’s one publication I would say is maybe ahead of us here is The Washington Post, which scares me, and they’re moving into that space. And there’s a lot of risk here for us. I mean, this is where we need to go to be consistent with — and I think there’s an intuition and a faith that we’re not reaching a lot of readers who might otherwise appreciate Times journalism, partly because they feel like they don’t recognize themselves in our opinion report. That said, we could piss a lot of people off, you know, doing this work. And we don’t have very good measures of the risk or the reward. But I mean, I’m sorry, again, I’m talking way too much. I guess, to sort of answer your question, it feels like a very — the reason we’re driving towards this position is, it is both true to what... it’s authentic. It’s what we’re supposed to do. The third reason actually is true. It’s true to who we’re supposed to be. And it feels very differentiated. Nobody else is doing it.  The third reason I would say is, I just think it — the world needs this from us right now. You know it is, it is cutting against, and I don’t mean to sound pious, but it really is true that this is a crude and dangerously polarized time. And this is where it’s journalistically true to the ambitions of the Times, to approach opinion in this way. The notion that anybody has a monopoly on what the right answers are is just a dangerous kind of form of hubris that too many of us are really falling prey to right now. And you look what’s happening in the world, the sort of crackup of ideologies, of political parties. Neither party really makes sense, I don’t think, right now, in the U.S., ideologically, and there are big questions about trade, for example, that have been reopened. And to simply assert that we know what the right answers are is not good for the democracy. So I think trying to show that it’s possible, both to have strong convictions and an open mind to other people’s egos, is a valuable contribution that we can make. NYT employee: So there are questions in Slack, but I don’t want to monopolize. So it’s kind of variations on the same question, so I’m just going to pick one. So, media literacy is a big problem. We see and understand the differences between the op-ed and editorial, but how do you communicate to readers and critics, and keep from sending mixed signals to the world? Bennet: I think we do a really bad job of this right now. I think, a) I think those categories — these are the sorts of categories that make sense to us and don’t make any sense to other people. Like, what is an op-ed? I’d kind of like to stop using that word, even internally, but we’re stuck with it. What is an editorial? We have been talking too long now, even in the time I’ve been here, about doing a better job of communicating this to readers. And we’re still not actually doing it very well. Partly, it requires product solutions that have so far eluded our grasp. But I think every piece that goes out to us needs to be very clearly labeled. Not just labeled “opinion,” which right there we have a problem, particularly in social. But we’ve gotten a little better there. But then, it needs to carry a description of what it is. That’s particularly true of editorials, but also other pieces of opinion. And right now, if you, I mean, you know, more than 80 percent of our readers encounter one piece of opinion from The New York Times a month, and that is their only exposure to Times opinion. And if that is a piece by Charles Blow or a piece by Bret Stephens or a piece by Erik Prince, you will form your opinion of who we are based on that one encounter with that one ambassador of our content. And this is... I mean, everybody has this problem: Somehow we have to do a better job at the atomic level of the individual piece of communicating a version of what it just took me 15 minutes to explain to you guys. So I’d welcome any suggestions on how to do that. One of the areas — I mean, small thing, but where I envy the Post right now — and I don’t know how good or effective it is — but they’ve built a little bit of [artificial intelligence] into their... and I don’t know what level. But they are now able to automate serving up not just one argument, but the counterargument with it. So the related links are right there. Whether anybody uses those links or not, it’s a nice statement about the brand and the ambition ― that we’re giving you this point of view, and here’s somebody who disagrees with it in one package, should you choose to go there. That’s the kind of thing, you know, we should be doing, I think. NYT employee: One of the questions on here is around the advocacy that you described. Can you talk a little bit about that? Bennet: This was related to the tax bill, which we’ve been editorializing against. And the voice of the editorial board went onto Twitter to do direct advocacy on it, urging holdout senators who agreed with a number of the positions that we’ve taken on what it would do to the deficit, and how it was shifting the burden of taxation, and the specific issues it didn’t deal with. They each had a different specific issue to stand their ground. It was the kind of experiment that I’ve been encouraging our people to do. And I’m still not sure we’ve learned from it. It had — and, Tyson, you weigh in here, you have a better sense. It had, it had a very big impact. It got a lot of people talking. It pissed off our colleagues in the Washington bureau hugely, because it felt to everybody like a more direct form of advocacy than we traditionally do. In reality, I’ve yet to — and maybe one of you can do this — I’ve yet to get the explanation for why that’s the case. The principled explanation for why this was more direct. Like, we editorialized for this specific election in defeat of a given candidate. We editorialize and say “You should go throw this bum out of office.” That, to me, is as direct a form of advocacy as we could possibly do. Saying “Go call the senator and urge them to stick to their principles” feels like a much less direct form of advocacy. Yet it didn’t... I mean, I can argue logically that it’s a much — I think I’m right. But it felt — and I think it felt that way because it’s just different than anything we’ve done before. It was therefore shocking people and upsetting. But I’m still scratching around to try to figure out where the violation of principle is here.  Tyson Evans, senior editor, opinion products and strategy: I think that was key. Part of the problem in evaluating it is we don’t really have anything to compare it to, because we haven’t done anything similar, so it’s hard to know what size of impact it was supposed to have. I think in the spirit of this moment where we’re trying to say, the form of an editorial is so purely a print construct over the last century, that we’re asking, who are these editorials for? And what action are we trying cause by writing them? And what’s the value of the institution taking a position on something in a moment where it’s just a lot easier for this industry to do something when they feel compelled to do it. When they read a well-written, persuasive argument. Those are the facts on the ground and I think we’re still wrestling with what to do with it, and what’s the capital we have, how many times a year. The Guardian kind of plowed the way forward with this a couple years ago with their “Keep it in the ground” campaign, which was very, very driven over the course of one or two years, I think. [inaudible] It was a really concentrated effort of advocacy and trying to mobilize the citizenship to divest and persuade their legislative groups. So I don’t know, I think we’re early, and we’d love input on what’s the right way to do it, what are the right moments. Bennet: There are definitely some tactical things that we would do differently if we do this again. And we were able to have an impact. I mean, we did jam the switchboards on Capitol Hill, which is a more tangible outcome than we often get when we editorialize, so. And then we got some pushback from some readers, and some from our colleagues. And from individual senators, who were really pissed. [Sen.] Susan Collins [R-Maine] was just — but, you know. NYT employee: I mean, maybe to build on this point ― you started by talking about creating a place for civil debate. There is something about this that says, “But we’re also going to go and take some proactive actions beyond civil debate and push one side of the agenda.” And how do you think about the editorial page within that debate?  Bennet: Well, part of the goal of having more debate is, again, the, you know, basically making the editorial line a little more relevant in some ways. Because if we’re all agreeing with each other, what’s the point of having editorials? I think the first-order question is, what’s the point of having editorials? And here’s what I think, is that it saves us from more of the real moral hazards in the opinion environment in which we want to say, we want to convene lots of voices from lots of points of view. I would worry and personally be concerned about saying we’re indifferent to what the right answer is, right? We don’t just want to let a thousand flowers bloom, let a thousand schools of thought contend, and we’ll just provide the platform. In which there is one version of this, in which [inaudible], I think the conversation will continue about whether that’s actually the right outcome. What the editorials allow us to do, is to say on matters of real consequence, where for one reason or another, this institution has felt a kind of historic connection, the Times is going to come down. And God knows, we argued against women’s suffrage on the editorial page of The New York Times, so we should be humble every time we write one of these about whether we’re actually right. But on big questions, you know, climate change — I think this tax bill actually qualifies. I didn’t mention this, but one of the things we’re trying to do is — and we have done, actually — is lower the key. You know, the last — since time immemorial now, it’s three editorials a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. We’re reducing the cadence, so there are fewer of them. And then this is something David has pressed me for for a long time, is, so what are the issues that The New York Times should be engaging with? [Note to readers: We’re not sure who “David” is.] I mean, I think there’s... the three fundamental, you know, values that guide the editorial on is — and I’m still wrestling with all of these questions, and I’ve not done a good enough job of distilling any of this — but we’re concerned about honesty, fairness and progress. Right? And those things can actually be thought of as usefully in tension with each other. For example, take particularly progress and fairness. I mean, I think we are pro-capitalism. The New York Times is in favor of capitalism because it has been the greatest engine of, it’s been the greatest anti-poverty program and engine of progress that we’ve seen. But The New York Times is very concerned with fairness. We’ve been concerned with the essential equality of human beings from the get-go, and with minority rights and individual rights from the get-go. And in thinking about, for example, the tax bill in this and that, you know, we actually like the idea of reducing corporate rates. We’re not for taxation for purposes of taxation, but we are very concerned about fairness and equitable distribution. And it’s sort of wrestling with the, with the tensions there is, I think, how we come out where we do. But, you know, there’s a hierarchy of specific concerns. Honesty speaks to, again, to my mind, it speaks to the free exercise of a sound conscience and our preoccupation with First Amendment rights, and the ability for people to always be able to speak their minds and advocate positions that they believe in. That’s kind of at the top of our hierarchy of concerns. NYT employee: Just reading off the Slack channel, I’m going to abstract it out a little, but when you have differing opinions, how do you first of all vet and make sure that facts are right? But maybe even going a step further, how do you make sure that people aren’t misrepresenting facts? Maybe if you could even tie that into how you even think about the voices you invite in, to kind of judge whether they’re really going to take a fair take on [inaudible]. Bennet: You know we do, I mean at a very basic level, we fact-check our work. So, there is a kind of layer there of having a — but the harder question is representation of fact. And that’s where we’re really, you know, are instilling rules of the road and kind of values for how we approach argumentation and hiring for people. And you know, the first-order value is intellectual honesty. And that means — and God knows we don’t succeed at this every day — but the goal is, you’re supposed to take on the hard arguments on the other side, not the easy arguments. Not the straw men, but the actual substantive, kind of toughest arguments and acknowledge when the other side has a point. No ad hominem attacks. There’s a sort of series of things that we expect of our people and we’re hiring, to my mind — the two columnists who have been brought on board since I’ve been here have been Bret and Michelle so far, and both of them totally clear the bar, in my view, of being people who have both conviction — strong points of view — and very open minds. I give our conservatives, in general, particular credit because they have to live this every day in a way liberals don’t, because they’re working in an environment where they are constantly having to grapple [with] people with very, very different points of view. It really is in the hiring, of picking people that have these different [inaudible]. But the seduction of straw-man arguing is quite powerful and something. And it’s a danger on the editorial side, too, that we face a lot. Particularly when you’re operating within an echo chamber. NYT employee: So, kind of building on that, there’s sort of a question related, which is, like, in a world where a lot of people are sort of interested [in] reading the thing that they agree with, how do you balance the desire to have opposing viewpoints versus, you know, people gravitating to certain kinds of coverage? So yeah, just, how do you think about that? Bennet: I’m really concerned about this for opinion journalism generally, because right now in the last couple of years, with your — particularly now, though, the rewards for saying the same thing over and over again, and providing that kind of affirmation, are huge. And the punishments for stepping out of line and saying something — I’m talking about the individual writer, now — saying, hey, actually you know, the Democrats have a point about X or the Republicans have a point about Y, depending on their point of view, you just get killed for that in social media.  Then the effect of this, and I think you can see it happening, is that writers are becoming less interesting. You know, I can say this particularly as someone who is looking forward to new opinion writers. And you want supple minds and people who are a little bit unpredictable, and you’re not reading the same piece over and over again. It’s getting harder to find people like that. And it is partly a function of the media environment. We need super-strong, tough people, for one thing, to weather that environment and stay true to the ambitions that we have for the work we want done. NYT employee: I’m going to read, specifically, just cause I want your reaction to it, which is, how do you have a civil debate when one side isn’t interested in being civil or factual? Bennet: I think there are a lot of people out there, on both sides actually, who aren’t that interested in — and I’ll be accused of both-siderism, I’m only saying that because I’ve experienced it — who aren’t particularly interested in being civil or factual. And that’s true. And I actually understand that feeling myself some days, when I don’t feel like I want to be terribly civil or factual because I’m so angry about it. Um, read the question again, it was —  NYT employee: Let me ask it this way. [inaudible] How do you think about, like, is there one side that isn’t — this specific thing is, one side isn’t interested in being civil or factual, and how do you think about that? Or not. Bennet: I think that that’s true, and I lament it. I just don’t want to give into that ourselves. And I also think there are a lot of people out there who are susceptible to feeling that way, who aren’t necessarily going to feel that way if they are presented with an alternative. And this is where I think if — it’s not like we’re going to win all those people over and bring them onto our platform necessarily. But I do think if we show that we take — let’s talk about it from the point of view of the left and think about conservatives. Most of our readers [inaudible] are liberal. I think if we show we take conservatives seriously and we take ideas seriously there, we get a lot more moderates paying attention to what The New York Times has to say. I think we lose the moderates completely if we just show that we think the conservatives are just, that there’s no point in even engaging their ideas or to debate with them. That’s not the same thing as saying, you know, I don’t think we’re going to reform everybody in the world.  NYT employee: It’s a follow-up to something kind of earlier. You identified that you’re having trouble finding new voices, and that a lot of the problems you’ve identified seem to be that we just don’t have people representing certain positions. During the election you had no strong advocate for [Sen.] Bernie Sanders [I-Vt.], or any of those positions. And so I guess, in the more recent months, in your attempts to find those voices, where have you been looking, what types of people have you been looking for, and how are you trying to get a more diverse group of people regularly writing in the op-ed section? Bennet: I think we need, and you know, I’m sorry if I’m going to talk in code a little bit here, but I’m not talking about ideology necessarily. I’m talking about identity, as well. What columnists do, you know,p again, highly intellectually honest, highly entertaining, highly interesting writers who have a lot to say — hard to find those people from the get-go. What a columnist is is a trusted voice in your ear that helps you process, kind of, the world in real time, right? Through a particular lens. And there are a number of lenses we’re missing right now, I think. And a lot of those are, it’s gender and it’s identity, you know, as well as ideology. So where am I looking? I’m asking, I’m asking you guys. You know, send me names, please. You know, if there are people that you’re reading that you think belong in The New York Times. You know, please. I always, when I was at The Atlantic, I always kept a list of Atlantic writers who didn’t work for The Atlantic, just who felt like — I was at The Atlantic magazine before I came back to the Times, and there was a particular kind of, not that dissimilar from the kind of people we’re looking for now, with voice. And I could see them on other platforms and they just didn’t know that they were Atlantic people yet, but they were. And I don’t have as good a list now as I did then. It might be my own failing. Earlier I blamed the environment for that. But I’m taking nominations.   I’ve been... if I could, this is what I would be spending 90 percent of my time on. Because hiring in general, and I’m sure you guys feel this, too, is the most important thing that we do. Like, that’s the most important editing we do, is picking the people. After that, you know, you ideally cut them loose to do their thing. In reality, I’m spending a small percentage of my time on this. So I would love help. So please send your nominations my way. NYT employee: So question for you. Do you consider women’s rights, trans rights, people of color’s rights, to be liberal stances? Bennet: Um, I consider them to be classically liberal stances, as I understand liberalism classically. Which is to say, very concerned with the rights of the individual. The sort of John Stuart Mill sense of the world. You know, in a sort of American modern ideological framework, I would say they are also understood to be liberal. But I guess that’s not necessarily the way I would — I mean, these are human rights and deeply connected, I think, to our understanding of human value, which, again, I think is core to the editorial convictions of The New York Times. The essential equality of human beings. NYT employee: Maybe, can I just do a follow-up on that one? How would you think about, like, when you think about encouraging open debate, something like trans rights versus climate change where, you know — are there certain things where you said, like, there’s really not a debate? Bennet: Oh yeah, there are certain things I would think of as settled law. And I think the fact of climate change is one of them. That is the science of climate change, that it’s happening and that humans are driving it. What to do about it, how to address it, I think that’s a big debate that, in general, we should be participating in more actively than we are, right? Yeah, there are issues like, “Nazism: good or bad?” is not a debate I imagine The New York Times necessarily convening. It’s just, like, I think there are issues that are settled law. Although, apparently now slavery is an issue again in the Alabama Senate race, as of today. There’s people making a case for that. Well, [Roy] Moore was asked — I only saw it — I guess he was asked when the last time America was great was, and that was when it was great.  NYT employee: So just to follow up on this, there was a thread in Slack on this. You know, with climate change, can people have opinions about it? You know, like with trans rights, can people have opinions about it? Or is The New York Times’ perspective, “No no no, the debate that we want to encourage is not whether there should be trans rights or whether there is climate change but the implications for society about it.” Or how do you think about it? Bennet: I think we should have discussions about what the implications are for society. I’m not sure I understand the question exactly. NYT employee: The question is — we’re talking about the debate, what matters are settled that shouldn’t even be debated, versus what the debate actually is. I think, you know, climate change is a good example. So they said that you have a voice in the opinion pages who maybe has a different perspective about what to do with climate change. You’d say, “It’s not that Bret Stephens opposes or doesn’t think climate change is happening,” right? Or is he representing that other perspective? How do you think about where the debate begins versus the debate having been settled? Bennet: We — let me answer this generically first, and then come back specifically to Bret and climate change. We have, this is, this is the hard and interesting debate we have all the time, which is, what are the boundaries for debate in Times opinion. There are no hard and fast rules here. And it’s our privilege and burden as editors to define those boundaries, and we will get it wrong, right? There will be times we’ll publish a piece that feels, “Wow, that’s really a little bit out of bounds.” I would expect that to happen sometimes. I’d be much [more] worried about the environment in which we never crossed that boundary than one in which every now and then we do. So, that’s going to happen, I think. And that said, we have faced this over and over again. For example, we published a piece — well, I just gave away the punchline — but we had a big argument over a piece by a settler. And you know, pick your issue. For some people it’s climate change, for some people it’s trans rights, for others it’s a two-state solution and the fate of the Palestinians. In this case, it was the settler saying, look, the two-state solution is dead and [it’s] time to face reality, and here’s some alternative paths for what the future would look like. And we had a real debate about whether this piece was crossing a line, because was it denying personhood to the Palestinians? Was it an act of, kind of, hate speech in a sense? I felt strongly that we should publish the piece and we did, as did others. Because this particular viewpoint is hugely consequential. It actually is creating reality on the ground. To pretend that somehow we would be — either to think that we were legitimating that point of view by having it in our pages or to tell ourselves that we were somehow changing the reality by not allowing it into our pages seems to me to be deluded a little bit. And our readers need to hear it, like, unmediated, I think. They need to confront these arguments. And we published that piece, and we faced that.  We talk a lot about the Richard Spencer test, you know: Would we publish Richard Spencer in the pages of The New York Times? The answer to that is no — oh, well, the piece we’d publish from him is “Why I Got Everything Wrong, by Richard Spencer,” if he was owning up to it. I mean, as you could imagine, there’s conditions. But the reasons we wouldn’t right now are largely because the guy is — he represents a particularly poisonous point of view. And that isn’t having those kinds of consequences. You know, it’s not a, it’s not a giant movement. We’ve published [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, you know, and should we not allow Vladimir Putin into our pages? It’s hard to say. It’s hard to say that that would be doing a service to our readers. But as you can see, I mean, I struggle to articulate what those boundaries are. It’s one of the hard things. You guys have to eventually render judgment, you know. And there’s a degree of subjectivity inevitably that creeps into all of these sorts of decisions, and it’s particularly true in the opinion environment. I do — and I mean, it is a real struggle, and I do want to emphasize the thought that I worry a lot more about how, again, over time, you play it safe, you play it safe, you play it safe, and you wind up where, I think, we were. And I think you become a lot less interesting and a lot less of a constructive source of force in this society if you are not willing to take some chances.  NYT employee: So [inaudible] if you publish one thing in this one perspective, how do you think about providing the balance or making sure that when you’re putting something out there — do you think about that? Or ... Bennet: Um, I do. I don’t think we do a great job of that, as much as, you know, we want to have this kind of cacophonous opinion report with a lot of different points of view represented. I think it’s hard to do it and have it be compellingly journalistic. If it’s kind of over-engineered, that is, we’ll only publish this point of view when we have a point of view on the other side. And we’ll present everything as a debate — well, actually there are four or five corners to this debate, and we’ve got to wait until we have all the pieces, and then we — people don’t consume journalism that way, and it doesn’t feel very vital. I think it needs to be a running debate, that we need to be more deliberate over time about representing all these points of view. And then again, it’s a product question, too, like once we have them all, we need to be able to present them as a kind of constellation. But even in the editorial piece of it, and this is part of what the reorganization of our team is about, we’re not doing — we’re getting better at that. And look, you guys, I mean, debates are — there are always many, many points of view. And you can’t — my view is that it’s just one side and the other side, but... more voices is going to help us with that. NYT employee: Do we have time for one more question? [inaudible] Bennet: What do you guys think we’re doing wrong? Or what would you change?  NYT employee: I think something that the staff would probably say is that, on the web, it can be difficult — and this is something that A.G. said when we did the Q&A with him — is that, on the web, it can be difficult to differentiate opinion pieces versus news pieces when they’re, like, right next to each other. That just generally, I think, continues to be a confusing point for a lot of people. Bennet: Yeah, yeah, I agree. We’re trying to make a bunch of changes, improve the labeling. We’re actually going to change — I mean these are, some of these are the sorts of cues we’ve used in the past that we tell ourselves matter but don’t really matter to the readers. I think we are going to wind up with a bolder kind of differentiated typographical treatment for our opinion pieces. But there are some basic things we should be doing, like when it’s an opinion piece, the bio of the writer should be at the top of the piece, so you know kind of some sense of who this is and what point of view they’re advocating. You know, that this is the president of Russia. You know, right now it can look like just a New York Times staff writer, and there are design and product solutions here that I hope we’re going to have in place in the first quarter next year. But honestly, I thought we’d have them in the first quarter of this year, so I can’t — um, things take a long time to work their way through the processes here. But I do agree. I worry about that a lot. I know I really don’t like our opinion work to be contaminated by the news side.",’s,remained,time
"“And, you know, [President Trump] doesn’t realize that, you know, that we could be heading towards World War III with the kinds of comments that he’s making.” That remarkably candid quote comes from Senator Bob Corker’s interview with the New York Times’ Jonathan Martin on Sunday. Corker is a sitting senator, a Republican, and the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, one of the most influential committees in Washington. In the same interview, Sen. Corker said, “I know for a fact that every single day at the White House it’s a situation of trying to contain him.” In August, Corker told reporters in Tennessee that Trump “has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability, nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful.” And over the weekend, in response to a barrage of Trump insults on Twitter, Corker responded that it was a “shame the “White House has become an adult day care center.” I must confess the emotions I felt when I watched Sen. Corker tell reporters, “I think Secretary Tillerson, Secretary Mattis, and Chief of Staff Kelly are those people who help separate our country from chaos” — I was afraid for my own children, and all children in the U.S., including those whose parents voted for Donald Trump. All of our children are in great jeopardy now, because of Donald Trump’s serious intellectual incapacities, dangerous emotional immaturity, and an amorality which suggests a complete moral emptiness and a lack of any ability to make moral judgements. Now this intellectual, emotional, and moral failure as a human being has his finger on the nuclear button. And that is the greatest threat to America and to the world today. Will other senators stand up for their country and our national security, as Sen. Corker has? How many Bob Corkers are there — how many Republicans will continue to make their Faustian bargain with a president who will promote the economic interests of their wealthy donors? And will America’s religious leaders stand up and speak for the nation against the threats that a President Trump now poses? Or will they make their own Faustian bargains with the president who gives them access and influence into a state newly committed to their “religious right” political agendas — devoid of any concerns for the poor, racial justice, refugees and immigrants, the environment or, indeed, the Christian call to peace-making and conflict resolution. President Trump reportedly told national security officials in July that he wanted to increase the U.S. nuclear arsenal tenfold — and this week, has threatened NBC News for reporting the story, suggesting they should lose their “licenses” to report the news. So the well-documented story on the nuclear threat Trump poses has now turned into another presidential threat, this time to the First Amendment. Here, as with this nation’s nuclear policies, Donald Trump seems not to understand. Complaining about press coverage is a long-standing presidential habit, but no American president has ever so blatantly attacked the press and so directly challenged the First Amendment to the Constitution. After hearing that the stockpile of U.S. nuclear weapons has been steadily reduced by international treaties and mutual nuclear obligations — something most Americans, let alone national political leaders from both parties, already knew — Trump was upset, and said he wanted to increase our stockpile to 1960s levels, as well as increasing troop levels and other military equipment. The NBC story describes a meeting in which top civilian and military national security leaders of the United States set out to, in the words of one official, “…slow down a little and explain the whole world” to the president of the United States. This meeting “included a number of tense exchanges.” (Reportedly, it was after this meeting that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson referred to Trump as a “moron.”) This is a president who during the campaign suggested that more countries ought to have nuclear weapons. Yet he has made a large number of bizarre and contradictory statements on nuclear weapons since launching his campaign. Joe Scarborough reported last summer that while in a foreign policy briefing, Trump asked three times why the U.S. can’t use nuclear weapons, since we have them. He then made a similar argument in an interview with Chris Matthews on Hardball. It is time for Christian concern to step in here. The first thing we should do is thank Sen. Corker for his courage and conscience in standing up to Trump’s dangerous statements and professed intentions. Here’s how you can do that: Tell the senator — by calling, writing to, or tweeting at him — that you are a Christian who shares his “concern” for the country. The second thing you can do is contact your own senators —  call the Capitol Switchboard at (202) 224-3121 and ask to be connected — and say you agree with Sen. Corker that if this presidential behavior continues, the U.S. Senate — Democrats and Republicans — must act to “contain” the president and limit his ability to press the nuclear button. A nuclear decision-making process and procedure that was built for speed should now be changed to account for rationality and wisdom, in the face of a president who has demonstrated neither capacity. For decades, Sojourners helped to lead broad national campaigns to stop and reverse the nuclear arms race. Christians and other people of faith were the animating core of the U.S. anti-nuclear movement. Sojourners helped initiate and lead the nuclear weapons “freeze” campaign, convened services around the country and in the nation’s capital, and organized massive protests including civil disobedience in Washington and nationwide. Our “Peace Pentecost” civil disobedience action in the U.S. Capitol in 1983, focused on first-strike nuclear weapons, lead to 242 arrests, the largest civil disobedience since the Vietnam War. We joined and co-sponsored actions at the Nevada nuclear test site and at nuclear weapons facilities across the country. And we produced fact sheets, theological reflections, and study guides — from “A Matter of Faith” to “Waging Peace” — to help educate U.S. churches about nuclear weapons and bring biblical and theological substance to the debates. A few weeks ago, Sojourners friend and columnist Wes Granberg-Michaelson wrote: “What’s at stake here is the possibility of a nuclear conflagration which seems more threatening than at any other time since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Instead of quiet, earnest diplomacy exploring every option to prevent this, we’ve heard cataclysmic threats and taunts from President Trump… past U.S. presidents have recognized that peace isn’t advanced by escalating taunts and insults.” Given the imminent danger and the demonstrated intellectual, emotional, and moral incapacities of President Trump, Sojourners is committed to help bring the present danger of nuclear weapons back into the center of our national conversation. We have claimed, along with many other Christian leaders, that our response to the unique peril of nuclear weapons is a matter or faith, not just politics. It still is; and it is time to respond again. This is an obligation of those who would follow Jesus, the one who instructs us to be peacemakers whom he calls the children of God. As Father Richard McSorley of Georgetown University wrote years ago, “It’s a sin to build a nuclear weapon.” We once put that on a poster. Perhaps it’s time to put the poster back up. Jim Wallis is president of Sojourners. His book, America’s Original Sin: Racism, White Privilege, and the Bridge to a New America, is available now. ",Trump,seems,policies
"English actor and comedian Stephen Fry has reportedly dodged blasphemy charges after authorities in Ireland failed to find enough people upset about damning comments he made about God two years ago. The self-avowed atheist had been under investigation by Irish authorities after stating during an appearance on an Irish TV program in 2015 that if God does exist he’s an “utterly evil” “maniac,” the Irish Independent first reported. Under the Republic of Ireland’s controversial Defamation Act 2009, an individual who publishes or speaks blasphemy “causing outrage among a substantial number of adherents” of a religion faces a fine of up to 25,000 euros, according to the BBC. An unidentified citizen told the Independent that he filed a complaint against Fry to Gardai, Ireland’s police force, shortly after Fry made his comments on TV. That individual, who spoke with the news site on the condition of anonymity, said he continued to follow up with authorities on the investigation’s progress, though he wasn’t personally slighted by Fry’s remarks. Authorities this week said they were unable to find “a substantial number of outraged people” and they are therefore concluding their investigation, the paper reported, citing an unnamed source close to the investigation. The man who reported Fry’s interview to police said he’s content with authorities’ handling of the case. “I did my civic duty in reporting it. The guards did their duty in investigating it. I am satisfied with the result and I don’t want to comment further,” he told the paper. Though Fry’s comments about God failed to ignite a firestorm of outrage against him, it did spark anger over the law, as well as demands for its removal. Ireland’s Minister for Health Simon Harris addressed the law on Monday, saying it’s “silly, a little embarrassing and needs to change.” “This is a democracy, and people have the right to express whatever view they do,” he said. Eoin Daly, a lecturer in law at the National University of Ireland, Galway, told the New York Times that the law is in place only because the country’s 1937 constitution requires it. Lawmakers obediently followed through on crafting such a regulation but made it so that it is “almost unenforceable,” he said. “There was a constitutional obligation to legislate this offense, but it was not against the constitution to create an offense that was of no use,” he said. The British Humanist Association and Atheist Ireland, which both spoke up in Fry’s defense, stressed that even if law enforcement agencies don’t prosecute such cases, just having the laws there puts the public at risk. “Blasphemy laws in England and Wales were repealed in 2008, but nonetheless remain on the books in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Neither law has been used in some time, but that was also true in Denmark, until its ‘dead’ blasphemy law was resurrected a couple of months ago, to bring charges against someone for the first time in 46 years,” the BHA said in a statement on Tuesday. Atheist Ireland made a similar point while flagging the reason for the case’s dismissal: the lack of outraged people. “The Gardai have not denied that the comments were grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matter held sacred by a religion,” the organization stated on its website. “Instead, the reported reason is that the Gardai failed to find a large number of people outraged by the comments.” Atheist Ireland stressed that even if legislators pass a law that they believe won’t be enforced, the country’s law enforcement officers will. “The police take our blasphemy law seriously, as indeed they should do, regardless of the nod and wink attitude of our legislators,” they stated. “We don’t know when the next investigation might happen, or what the outcome might be. But we know that it will have to involve a large number of people demonstrating outrage.”",laws,repealed,Scotland
"I just came back from the White House, where the police are still arresting the hundreds of students who are taking part in what will likely be the largest act of youth civil disobedience at the White House in a generation.  This is XL Dissent: a massive surge of protest against the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline and a powerful show of solidarity with all communities who are fighting the fossil fuel industry and confronting the impacts of the climate crisis.

""An entire movement has thrown itself into in this Keystone fight, from local frontline groups to big national green organizations,"" 350.org co-founder Bill McKibben wrote in an email. ""But this weekend shows the power and bravery of some of the most crucial elements: young people, and activists who understand the centrality of  environmental justice."" The scene down at the White House this afternoon was incredible. There were just over a thousand students that rallied in Lafayette Park, but it sounded like 10 thousand. This wasn't your parents' protest, but the spark-shooting dynamo of student movement that is beginning to embrace its true power.

""Obama was the first President I voted for, and I want real climate action and a rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline,"" said Nick Stracco, a Senior at Tulane University and one of the lead organizers of XL Dissent. ""The people that voted him into office have made it absolutely clear what we want, and that's to reject Keystone XL."" The action this morning began up at Georgetown University, where last summer President Obama pledged that he would only approve the Keystone XL pipeline if it didn't significantly increase greenhouse gas emissions. At around 10:30am, students surged out of the gates of campus and headed towards the White House. Along the way, they stopped at Secretary Kerry's house and unfurled a giant mock oil spill in the middle of the street. It's up to Kerry to make a recommendation to President Obama on whether or not Keystone XL is in the the country's national interest. While students are counting on Kerry to build on his legacy as a climate champion and push for a rejection, they're not taking any chances.  After arriving in Lafayette Park across from the White House, young people heard from speakers representing communities on the frontline of climate impacts and the fight against the fossil fuel industry. Chris Wahmhoff from Michigan rallied the crowd in support of the three MICATS (Michigan Coalition Against Tar Sands) activists who have been charged with up to three years in prison for taking direct action against a tar sands pipeline. Youth indigenous leader, Jasmine Thomas spoke about the impact of tar sands mining in Canada and the fight against other proposed pipelines.

Then, with a resounding cheer, the crowd of students surged towards the White House fence. Within minutes, hundreds of young people had secured themselves to the fence with plastic handcuffs. A group of activists in hazmat suits deployed a giant mock oil spill on the sidewalk as the police began to cordon off the area. I was standing with press from Politico, the National Journal, CNN, CBS and others as students continued to cheer and chant at the White House fence. Even the seasoned reporters seemed impressed by the scale of the protest. No one could think of a larger student civil disobedience at the White House. We'll get the final numbers of arrests from the police later tonight, but it's already clear that this is one for the history books.   After they get arrested, students are being taken to a police processing center in Anacostia where they will be fined and released, if all goes according to plan. We've got an incredible team of XL Dissent organizers and volunteers who will be waiting to support them when they get out.  There have been a lot of protests against the Keystone XL pipeline, but XL Dissent had a new sense of energy, determination, and excitement. This movement isn't going away, it's getting stronger by the day. More than 70,000 people have now signed on to the Keystone XL Pledge of Resistance to show that they are willing to engage in civil disobedience if President Obama moves forward with approving the Keystone XL pipeline. XL Dissent will only help cement that commitment and energize opposition to the project.  
Photo: @DCMediaGroup President Obama has a choice to make. He can side with Big Oil and approve Keystone XL, tarnishing his environmental legacy and getting little political benefit in the process. Or he can stand with the generation of young people that helped power him into office and reject this XL climate disaster. It's time to make the right call.",police,deployed,area
"On Friday, April 6, The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, sat down with the magazine’s star national correspondent, Ta-Nehisi Coates, for a live question-and-answer session in front of the company’s staff. This was a scheduled event, part of the media company’s in-house “Atlantic University” series, but the off-the-record conversation took on a new urgency because of what had happened the previous day. On Thursday, April 5, the magazine had announced that it was cutting ties with Kevin Williamson, the irascible conservative writer it had installed in the magazine’s “Ideas” section only two weeks earlier. The impetus for his departure was the revelation that Williamson actually believed the things he had said in the past — namely his 2014 comments that women who have abortions should be hanged. This had led Goldberg to conclude that The Atlantic, recently purchased by Laurene Powell Jobs’ liberally minded Emerson Collective, was “not the best fit for his talents.” What the centrist magazine might’ve once considered nothing worse than a cheeky heterodoxy from its right flank was now, Goldberg had discovered, suddenly and unacceptably outside the mainstream. The Atlantic, whose motto is “of no party or clique,” had found itself in an awkward spot. In the weeks since, we’ve heard Williamson’s version of events. Preaching the story of his martyrdom in media outlet after media outlet after media outlet, the columnist has portrayed himself and even Goldberg, too, as the victims of a “Twitter mob,” forced to suffer the tyranny of our “P.C. culture.” Apparently, Goldberg had severely misjudged what Williamson’s hiring would mean to a larger audience. In The Wall Street Journal, Williamson recounts a conversation he’d had with Goldberg shortly after he’d been hired: “You know, the campaign to have me fired will begin 11 seconds after you announce that you’ve hired me,” I told him. He scoffed. “It won’t be that bad,” he said. “The Atlantic isn’t the New York Times. It isn’t high church for liberals.” Beyond his initial statement, Goldberg has said nothing publicly about the episode. But in his Atlantic University appearance with Coates, he tried to explain his thinking to his staff. Characterizing the meeting, an Atlantic spokesperson wrote in an email to HuffPost: “Jeff hosts regular meetings on issues large and small with staff. The meeting with Jeff and Ta-Nehisi had been scheduled for some time and just so happened to have fallen the day after the Williamson episode, which provided an opportunity for staff to speak openly and ask questions and for Jeff to respond frankly and transparently.” HuffPost viewed a video of the session; a full transcript can be found below. It’s a remarkable exchange. Coates, who has spoken admiringly of Williamson’s prose style if not his politics, is frank and searching and self-critical where Goldberg is glib and simpering, apparently unaware of just how much and why the ground had shifted beneath his magazine’s feet. The conversation centers on Williamson and the decision not to keep him around. But it winds up being about more than that. Coates talks about having learned, as a young journalist, from writers who thought of black men like him as less than human. What choice did he have? These were the journalists who got bylines in prominent magazines, and even at liberal publications, the genetic inferiority of black people was a proposition considered worthy of debate. “I didn’t really have the luxury of having teachers who I necessarily felt, you know, saw me completely as a human being,” Coates says. The question of diversity in media alone is fraught territory. In 2016, a group of employees returning from the 2016 National Association of Black Journalists conference sent a letter to Goldberg expressing concerns with the magazine’s monochromatism, according to multiple people who were on staff at the time. By all accounts, Goldberg has since taken steps to address the criticism. Since Goldberg became editor-in-chief in October 2016, The Atlantic had added 34 full-time journalists to the newsroom, of which 25 have been women and 11 have been people of color, according to a spokesperson. But Coates wasn’t making a point about diversity or, for that matter, about the pedagogical possibilities of broadmindedness. He was talking about the protective layer of cynicism he had to develop against certain kinds of political ideas. Coates had no expectations of Williamson beyond some flowery prose. No expectations, he says to his colleagues, of Williamson “seeing me or, frankly, a lot of you as fully realized human beings.” This was the idea being circled in the conversation between Coates and Goldberg and their colleagues at The Atlantic. Over and over, the humanity of certain people is allowed to be put up for debate in the name of “ideological diversity.” How can a liberal institution square its essential humanism with an ideal of inclusion so baggy as to promote the sort of cruelties that liberals, at least outwardly, mean to oppose? The similarly oriented New York Times op-ed page, run by former Atlantic editor James Bennet, is wrestling with this very question. On the basis of his conversation with Coates and the magazine’s staff, Goldberg doesn’t seem any closer to answering it than is the Times or any other creature of centrist liberalism. At least The Atlantic has company. You might call it a clique. The conversation has been lightly edited for grammar and continuity. And if you’re a current or former Atlantic employee, please feel free to get in touch. Jeffrey Goldberg: I said this in the meeting this morning, the dot-com meeting. You know, we do these things because we’re a cohesive unit, and we all work together. And it’s great when we get to talk openly about complicated issues, but we can’t do it if people are feeding information to people outside about what we’re talking about. And so, I recognize the desire to share things, but it would be better if we didn’t. We’ll call this off the record for whatever that means in today’s age, but it would be better if we could just have an honest conversation. Ta-Nehisi Coates: So the genesis of me as a journalist is like, mid-’90s — I got my first writing job in ’96 — and a big ideas magazine at the time was The New Republic. No black people worked there. I’ve actually verified this. No black people worked there at all. And to my mind — other people will probably feel quite differently about this — but as far as I was concerned, it was basically a racist publication. And that was how I perceived it. But nevertheless, I had to read it. I had to read it because I wanted to do what they did. And there weren’t — and I don’t know how to put this without sounding like an asshole — but there was no me to learn from. In other words, there was no “Case for Reparations” for me to read and say, goddamn, I want to go do that. I mean, maybe there was some of that, but it really was not in the ethos. There were certainly black writers who would be brought in. They would come into places like the New Republic, New Yorker and sometimes even The Atlantic, and they would give a view of black life that I felt like very few black people actually would recognize themselves in their own private spaces. I got, I think, incredibly used to — and I don’t know if it’s a good thing or a bad thing, I guess for a long time I probably thought it was a good thing, but this week it made me think I don’t know whether it is or not — but I got incredibly used to learning from people. And studying people. And feeling like certain people were even actually quite good at their craft, who I felt, and pardon my language, were fucking racist. And that was just the way the world was. I didn’t really have the luxury of having teachers who I necessarily felt, you know, saw me completely as a human being. This extends not just from my early days as a journalist, but if I’m being honest here, from my early days at The Atlantic. You can go into The Atlantic archives right now, and you can see me arguing with Andrew Sullivan about whether black people are genetically disposed to be dumber than white people. I actually had to take this seriously, you understand? I couldn’t speak in a certain way to Andrew. I couldn’t speak to Andrew on the blog the way I would speak to my wife about what Andrew said on the blog in the morning when it was just us. Goldberg: I found, personally, that yelling at him in the office was very emotionally satisfying for me. But you didn’t do that. Coates: I didn’t do that. And part of it was, going back to that earlier thread, I learned how to blog from Andrew. That was who I actually learned from. That was who actually helped me craft my voice. Even recognizing who he was and what he was, you know, I learned from him. I think one of the things that happens is you become incredibly cynical about certain people and about certain political beliefs, and you just don’t hold them to a level. So I can read Kevin Williamson, for instance, and I guess — and I probably would not have said this like this two weeks ago — but just watching, and thinking, and not really having expectations. Like, having craft expectations — like reading him and saying, how can I learn from this as a writer. But not really having actual expectations of seeing me or, frankly, a lot of you as fully realized human beings. And everybody here knows my politics. I know what The Atlantic is supposed to be, but I’m not speaking for them, I’m just speaking for myself. I think — and I think I’ve actually argued this in The Atlantic — that that is not just a personal flaw of Kevin Williamson. That is a part of the movement that he’s a part of. It represents a large swath of this country. And I think the problem for us, or the essential conflict for us, is that we set ourselves up with I think a pretty admirable value that says, OK, we are going to debate different poles of politics in this country. And we want that well-represented, and we want people that can do it effectively, write well. But if one pole is — and again, I’m only speaking for myself here — if one pole is batshit crazy, you’re in trouble. It actually throws the whole endeavor out of whack. The thing that ultimately made this not go was Kevin’s really callous podcast, where he says, I have a soft spot for hanging. He’s talking about literally hanging women. And now, we’re in a room obviously with a large number of women. The question of abortion is not theoretical to them. It’s not an abstract question. You know, again, not making any assumptions but just knowing the statistics, it’s probably a very direct question to some women in this room. So when Kevin says that he’s talking about them. And that’s bad, but when I thought about it, if you believe abortion is murder, and you believe in capital punishment, what’s the logical conclusion? Is this Kevin himself or is this a broader question? In other words, did Kevin state a specific belief that is outside of the mainstream conservative movement, or did he just follow those conclusions to their natural place? And if he did, you have a much broader problem, I think, in terms of this whole question of actual debate. You know, I’ve thought quite a bit — and you can interrupt whenever you want. Sorry, obviously I’ve been thinking about this, and I don’t have nobody to talk to because I’m off Twitter. Goldberg: Wait, wait, wait, you should be fully honest. His new version of Twitter is — he’s one of those people who text messages every individual thought individually. It’s like ping, ping — so I’m your new fucking Twitter. [laughter] Goldberg: Twelve, 15 texts in a row that you could have made one paragraph. Coates: I’m sorry — Goldberg: That’s where it comes from. I just realized! So he has been actually tweeting, but just at me. Coates: It’s true, it’s true. Among other people. But you know, I was an admirer of Kevin’s work, and I think I can say this, you know, Jeff talked to me about this. And I was not like, don’t hire that dude. To the contrary, I thought, OK, well he can come in and represent the position, and then we can fight it out. You know what I mean? So I think I should say, A) I feel like I failed Jeff in that advice. I feel like I kind of failed The Atlantic in that advice. I feel like I failed the writers of color here in that advice. I was here when I was the only black writer, and then Gillian came, and then we got a bunch more people. So I feel like I kind of failed you guys in that. I’m sorry about that. I’m sorry so many of y’all are on social media and catching shit for this, and I’m not there, so I’m not catching anything at all. I feel really, really bad about that. But then after, realizing that, I thought about, OK, so how did I muck this up? Goldberg: I want to issue an absolution here. Coates: I don’t need it, though. I don’t need it. Goldberg: No, no, but I’m going to give it anyway. But go on. Coates: So I thought about it, like, you know how did I miss that? I’m Mr. Blackity Black, how did I miss that? And I think one of the things that happened is, again, like understanding the mission of The Atlantic, which I get. It might not be my mission, but I get it, and I work here. I understand it. Debate various views, you know, we fight it out. “Of no party or clique,” right? And I told Jeff this already, but we have been of a party and a clique. The Atlantic, like most magazines — not The Atlantic because it’s specifically bad, but for most of its history it has been basically white dudes. That’s what we’ve been. I mean not totally, not completely. We did publish Frederick Douglass and Martin Luther King. And I mean, it’s not that that’s all we published, but that’s basically been what one would say the consensus is. When you have an already established consensus like that, certain values are then easily manifested. I think one of the things that happened at this magazine now that I’ve championed, I’m happy to see just looking at this room. If we had done Atlantic University in 2008, 2009, ’10, ’11, ’12, ’13, it would not have looked like this. This publication is diversifying. And I wonder if that consensus that says of no party or clique then has to come up for question. What is debatable comes up for question because you bring different people in, and those people are not just brown-skinned or dark-skinned or women who would normally — you know, who are just the same as any other. Their identity — and I know this is bad in certain quarters, but I don’t think it is — that identity cannot be neatly separated from the job. So maybe the job changes a little bit. Goldberg: So let me just say two things on that. First is, in all seriousness, the decisions are on me. They’re not on you or anyone else who met Kevin beforehand. The decisions are on me. And you know, I appreciate your advice, and I always appreciate your advice. But it’s not you. The second part is, and I am torn on this, part of trying so hard to diversify gender, race, ethnicity, orientation, whatever, part of it is to make sure that we’re of no party or clique. Right? I mean, I’ve told — you know this, we’ve talked about it — I’ve told senior editors I never want to walk into a meeting at The Atlantic where decisions are being made and not have a diverse room and not have black people and brown people and women and whatever. And part of that is very specifically a New Republic thing, if you’ll recall, because when they published — this is going back 20 years — but when they published an excerpt of The Bell Curve, the decision to publish that was made in a room with only white people. So what I’m saying is that my goal of never walking into a room where decisions are being made and seeing only white people, white males, is partially because that’s the right thing, and it’s partially self-protection. Because I think if there had been a black editor in that room in the New Republic in 1996 or whatever, that black editor might have said: “Excuse me. So I just want to clarify something. We’re putting a cover story up that says black people are stupider than white people?” That could have happened, and then they would have saved themselves an awful lot of grief; and they wouldn’t have injected something that, in my own personal opinion, is poison into the discourse. On the other hand, why can’t a journalism institution that is diversifying — I hope people understand — fairly rapidly in terms of gender, ethnicity, race, why can’t it also continue to develop in an ideologically diverse way? And maybe there’s some questions that are no longer on the table because of that, but there’s got to be a whole bunch of questions that we could still disagree about without touching the third rails of gender and abortion and race and all these other things. I mean, what are you saying? That we do have to become what a lot of the world wants us to be, which is a stay-in-you-lane, center-left publication? Coates: No, I think the deal is that in the ’90s, when this room would not have looked like this room does, there were things that were considered out of bounds. I don’t think we would have published “The Case for Reparations” then. If you change the makeup of the room, other things probably would become inbounds, and some things then become out of bounds. And I think the problem is, some of those things — this is the huge, huge problem — some of those things that I would argue should be out of bounds, actually a large number of Americans actually believe. Things that would be out of bounds for us are not necessarily out of bounds for the broader country. Goldberg: Or big parts of the country. Coates: No, huge parts, huge parts. I mean we got data on this during the Republican primary, right? They took data, 30, 40 percent of Americans agree with this sentiment. I’m sorry, not of Americans, of Republican voters. I should be clear about that. But you know, a huge swath of Americans, like 30 or 40 percent [of Republican voters] believe that black people are not as smart as white people. Or believe black people are somehow more criminally inclined. That’s a lot of people. That’s a lot of people. And obviously that’s out of bounds for us. Goldberg: No, we’re never running shit like that, obviously. Coates: So to some extent the debate is already curtailed. There are views that are very popular in America that we will not deal with. Goldberg: That’s the funny thing, because, you know, somebody asked me the other day, what won’t we run? And I could probably reel off 200 ideas that we would never post. You know, genetic-inferiority issues. Coates: And that’s an ongoing debate in respectable publications right now. Goldberg: No, if somebody came in and said George Soros and the Rothschilds are destroying Eastern Europe because of Jewish cosmopolitanism and controlling D.C.’s weather, we ain’t going to — you know, we’re not doing that. And by the way this has been what makes the conversation so meta. What I learned myself Thursday is — and this is the interesting question, because it’s about past opinion. Opinion that wouldn’t even necessarily get expressed obviously in The Atlantic. But like, if you actually sincerely, seriously argue with a level of callousness that women who have abortions not only should be prosecuted criminally — which puts you on the right end of the right-to-life spectrum anyway — but that hanging is a possibility, we need to be serious about that and say we’re not taking a piece that says that, right? So there’s 100 things, 200 things that we just wouldn’t ever publish, but I would just encourage you to, instead of thinking about a narrowing, think about all the things that we still can do. Like, there’s a lot more. Coates: No, I’m not thinking about a narrowing. I think we can actually do a lot more. I just think it’s like, again, if your consensus is there, it’s here now. The number of things that you can do is not actually changed. Goldberg: Could we have a debate in The Atlantic on abortion rights? Can you have an anti-abortion person — in your mind, obviously? Coates: I mean, you could. Goldberg: No, I’m saying, as The Atlantic, is that out of bounds now? What’s out of bounds? Coates: I mean, this is me talking, but I just don’t think Kevin was out of the mainstream in terms of those views. So if you do that, I don’t understand the logic of getting rid — he said it in a really rude ... Again, I just got to go through this one more time. In the platform of the Republican Party: death penalty. In the platform of the Republican Party: pro-life. The belief that abortion is murder is not a fringe view. Defense of capital punishment is not a fringe view. If somebody participates in baby killing, and you advocate for the death penalty for them, I don’t understand that as a particularly— it’s said in a kind of way that people don’t usually say it. But the logical inference of it, like, how does the logic exist out of some sort of mainstream consensus? I’m not seeing that. And so, if we have that debate, and then we have a bunch of people who are kind of talking around a very uncomfortable fact of the belief that Kevin raised, I guess I would be like, why don’t we just have Kevin do that? Kevin was honest, at least. Kevin spoke about the actual logical outcomes. I just want to be clear, I don’t agree with that. I think it’s completely batshit crazy, but at least it’s consistent. He took it to its logical ends, which I think a lot of people are afraid to do. Now, there are some people, like Ross [Douthat] at the Times, who actually are anti-death penalty and, you know, pro-life, so the logic would not work [inaudible]. Goldberg: No, but do the conversation that we did a couple days ago about spirit of generosity. It’s this mantra that we repeat all the time, and I think people internalize it. But talk about that in the frame of this conversation. I mean, what does it mean to you? What does it mean to you in the conversation we’re having about a particular way of expressing yourself? Coates: I mean I have particular views, man, and I’m uncomfortable with the idea that The Atlantic should necessarily adopt my views. Goldberg: Well, no, The Atlantic is not going to adopt your views. Coates: No, but I don’t want to even — I just ... Goldberg: These are smart people. They can handle your views. Coates: I mean, I don’t think it’s particularly generous to say that you or the state should have authority over a kind of labor that only 50 percent of most people — or slightly more in this country — actually do. I don’t think that’s generous. I don’t think that’s generous at all. I don’t think it’s generous to believe that some 16-year-old girl somewhere, you know, who — no, we’re not even going to do some 16-year-old girl. Let’s do this a lot more direct. My son — I love my son, I love him to death. And this is like the other part of Kevin’s story, which I heard and I understand and I get it. But my wife had gestational diabetes, swelled up like 80 pounds while she was pregnant with my son, [and she] almost died in our apartment when I was 24 years old. And the notion that she should not have control over a process that almost killed her, I don’t think is generous. I just don’t — the belief, not how Kevin said it. Now, I wish he would state that more politely. But no, I actually don’t think the belief is generous. And you know, again, that’s my belief. I’m not saying The Atlantic got to adopt it, but, no, I don’t think it’s generous at all. And I’ve got to say, let me back up, too, because I don’t want to get too righteous. In my advice to you, I was thinking about the debate part, and I forgot about the generosity part. Goldberg: Oh, when we were talking? Coates: When we were talking I completely forgot about it. Because I would have raised — I would have said this shit is quite obviously not generous, you know. But of course, then, I would have gone to the larger debate and said, well, is it the belief, or is it how I actually feel about this? You know, I think a lot, from my end, a lot of this comes from just a general — there’s no other way to say this — a lack of respect for certain views. So then you don’t really actually think about the implications in the same sort of way. You’ve already written people off. Goldberg: I mean, actually, you’ve done a very interesting thing here, which is, you’ve encapsulated the tension of being The Atlantic in a kind of way. Which is wanting to be the most robust center for debate in America but also trying to be generous of spirit and have a sort of a merciful attitude toward people who don’t have — Coates: And I wonder if those two things are, at this moment, if you will ... I actually think there is — and I think you’re in a much better position, honestly — but I think that this is happening here, and what’s happening with Bennet at the Times right now. I just don’t think it’s a mistake. I don’t think it’s a mistake. Goldberg: Wait, what’s not a mistake? Coates: Well, I don’t think it’s a mistake that, you know, we’re having these really, really hard debates about what views get access to what. And crazily enough, and I know — I think I can say this among us — just from talking to James, he’s tried do a very similar thing to what you’ve done here. He would love to diversify the paper, have more voices, and I know he wants that. And I think, like you also, he wants a broad range of debate. Like, those two things actually, as you said, they’re part of each other. And I guess what I’m suggesting is they actually might also be in conflict with each other. Goldberg: Look, I mentioned this this morning in a meeting just for the web team. I think the founding manifesto of The Atlantic is in tension with itself. Because I mean, the founders had this tension 161 years ago. They were all abolitionists. They’re not hosting the debate. Coates: Which, by the way, was not a mainstream view at the time. Goldberg: In Boston, it was a mainstream view, where they were making a magazine. But they were not going to — there was no thought that they were going to host a debate about abolition or about the rightness or wrongness of slavery. They had a position. They also said that we want to be a marketplace for a discussion of the American idea, which means that you have to have an argument. So I think what we’re going around and saying, sort of, a little bit, is that — the old line is, you know when you’re in a minefield when you hear a loud explosion under your feet. Right? Nobody knows where are the lines. We don’t really know where the lines are, but I guess my question to you — and this is a generational question — I think one of the reasons we are on more of a same page than not on the Kevin Williamson question is that we’re of a certain generation, like you talked about, where our journalism institutions — there was a lot of fighting. There was just a lot of fighting and arguing. I mean people who were here eight years, 10 years ago. Coates: Yeah, it was constrained fighting, though. Actually, I’m not sure — Goldberg: It wasn’t that constrained here eight, 10 years ago. I mean, when we were all bloggers. Me, you, Ross, Andrew. Coates: Yeah, but I would argue that it was constrained even then because I was the only — I think I can even make this broader — I know I was the only black writer. I think I was the only writer of color. And there was only one other woman, and that was Megan. So I would say it was even constrained then. And now, that’s not the case. So it is actually, I think, more difficult. And I mean that in a good way. Like, not more difficult in that we should go back to the old way, but I think it was constrained. I think it’s much easier to draw a consensus when you’re pulling from the same demographic. And I don’t mean consensus, like you all don’t argue, but you can say, OK, the line is here, the line is here, let’s fight it out. That’s easier when everywhere — let’s make it even deeper. I mean, at that time, me, you, Ross, Megan McArdle, Jim, Matt Yglesias, Andrew — I think every single one of those people, with the exception of me, went to an Ivy League school. I mean, in many ways, people are coming from a very, very similar place. You know, that’s not what this is now. Goldberg: Do you think The Atlantic would be diminished if we narrowed the bounds of acceptability in ideological discourse, even as we grow in diversity? Coates: Again, I don’t think it’s a question of narrowing. I think it’s where the lines are drawn. Goldberg: Well, it is if you bring the lines in. Coates: Well, no, you open it up. You understand what I’m saying? Like, as I said before, I don’t think 15 years ago or 20 years ago we would have ran “The Case For Reparations.” So that means it’s opened up in a different direction. I think if we publish kick-ass stories, very little of this will actually matter. Goldberg: Go on about that. Talk about reporting. [laughter] Goldberg: I mean, I don’t care. I mean people just, I mean, we talk about this. People ask me, you know, how does this controversy affect you. And I’m like, I have leather skin, so whatever. I mean, I’m sorry for people who are getting attacked on Twitter because they happen to be affiliated with The Atlantic. I’m insensitive to it after 30 years of this. But I mean, this will last until it doesn’t, until it goes away. But the question is the reporting thing. I’m very interested in that, reporting vs. opinion. Some people have written me and said, you know what, opinion generally is overrated, don’t do opinion, do reporting. I mean, you have thoughts on that I want you to share with everybody. Coates: You know, when I came they weren’t in conflict. I think reported opinion are better than unreported opinions. Goldberg: Well yeah, pure opinion is — is not the greatest thing. Coates: Yeah, you shouldn’t do too much of that. You should stretch yourself. Because I think it’s always good, even as I’m saying what I’m saying, I do think it’s always good to come in contact with real people who may not share your assumptions and where you’re coming from. It doesn’t mean that they’re going to convince you. But they broaden you, they deepen you, you know, give you some perspective on things that you just may not have seen before. So I actually think that’s probably the core value. Goldberg: The core value of The Atlantic? Coates: Yeah, man. Well I don’t know if it’s been the core value, but I think that’s the one that matters. If you publish kick-ass stories, nobody’s going to care. Nobody’s beating down The New Yorker saying, where is you Kevin Williamson or where are your conservative writers. Like, it’s amazing how they don’t get that at all. Goldberg: Well, they’re a different product, though. They’re an entirely different product. Coates: No, that’s true. It’s true. But you know, the stories they publish obviously occupy a lot of real estate and have a kind of impact. Goldberg: Yeah, but they would never publish ” The Case For Reparations,” which is reported argument. Coates: I don’t think they would either. They say they would, though. [laughter]. Goldberg: Yeah, NOW. Coates: Now they do, now they do. Goldberg: Easy to say it now! No, I told you, they’d run it as a 6,000-word story: “The Lonely Struggle of John Conyers.” Coates:They would, they would. But by just taking that on, I go back to where I started. I don’t know that we were “of no party or clique.” I know we said that, but I would question whether that was actually the case. Goldberg: Is that something to strive for even if we never reach it. Your own opinion. Coates: I just feel like if we publish really, really great journalism, like ... I know that sounds simplistic, and maybe it is simplistic. Maybe I’m being flip. Goldberg: Let me ask you one final question before, and we’ll take questions. Coates: You know, my thinking about this now, like where I’m at now. You know what I would like to do? I would like to get a stack of Kevin Williamson’s articles and compare them to what the standard is here at The Atlantic. I wonder if they measure up. Goldberg: That’s an interesting question. It’s not entirely relevant because we don’t hire — you know, I mean this is one of the arguments … Coates: No, I know, that people get better when they come here. I get it, yes, yes. Goldberg: If we’re not making them all better then we’re not fulfilling the mission. But one more thing on this before we go to questions. I want to understand, as a journalist, put aside the other extraneous things that are going on around here, as a journalist, what attracted you to Kevin Williamson? You said on a podcast — Coates: I think he’s a beautiful — I love people that, you know, I don’t like people who fuck around. I don’t like people who sort of do that duck and dodge, and he writes with a kind of aggression you know that I actually seek to write with myself. When I wrote “The Case for Reparations,” he wrote a reply. And I was so happy that he did. There was, like, no other conservative person I would have answered at all. You know, I was happy to be in debate with him. I, again, I’m from a place where I can take my lessons from people and not agree with a damn thing they’re saying. You know, that’s just me. You know, reporting is one thing; that’s important. But the writing is actually really, really important for me. And I thought, when he was on, he’s really, really good actually. Like, the writing is really, really good. I don’t take that back, although I do want to kind of have that thought experiment again. But that was at least my impression at the time. That when he was on, he was pretty damn good. And I don’t think I was actually alone in feeling that. And I don’t just mean you. I mean outsiders, but I think there were other people who felt that way who were not necessarily crazy. That don’t mean this was the right decision, or the right thing or the wrong thing happened — that’s not what I’m saying. But I don’t think I was alone in admiration with his craft. And I guess — you know what I learned from this? You know, when I went out and said, I think he’s a kick-ass writer. I don’t [inaudible], but I think he’s a kick-ass writer. Like, I actually can’t say things like that anymore. Even if it’s what I think because, you know, and I’m just coming back to this again. But what became clear to me was that other people get drawn in because I’m part of The Atlantic. That’s been really hard to see, you know. I say that, and probably if I was on Twitter, he would be in my mentions calling me to account. But I’m not there, right? So you see other people who ain’t said nothing at all. Who ain’t done nothing but just try to do their job. Who ain’t had nothing to do with this. You know, getting called on stuff. And that’s just hard to see. That’s very, very hard to watch. Goldberg: Why don’t we take some questions here. Staffer: Kevin conjured a really powerful image when he used the word “hanging.” I think that was an image that was really hard for a lot of us to ignore. And I’m wondering how or if you think this would have played out differently if he hadn’t used that word. Coates: Great question. Staffer: Or if he had just said death penalty or even lethal injection. How much of it was “hanging?” Coates: I’m not sure we’d be here right now. I’m not sure we’d be here. I think it’s the specificity, you know, which is akin to how he writes. I mean, I think that’s exactly right. And I think that points to the tension of it. Was he just too clear? Was it really his viewpoint? Was it actually his viewpoint? Or was it just that he said it in a kind of way? Goldberg: You know, the weakness of writers is they want to be interesting. Coates: Yeah, but it’s not even interesting. Goldberg: No, but it’s vivid, you know. You’re always trying to be vivid and provocative, and it goes to that question of line. Like, you know the line only when it’s been crossed, right? And everybody feels collectively, oh, that’s the line. Coates: But I think the point here is, it’s your job to be vivid. It’s your job to use — I do that all the time! You know, you’re trying to actually use vivid language, all of us. And so it’s like, did he just write about this with more clarity? And certainly, there’s an asshole-ish, troll-ish portion to that that should not be ignored. And — and this will probably come up, I’m not trying to step on anybody — but, honestly, the piece about hanging is just the tip of it. There are other things he said and wrote that I think act, you know, similarly. Goldberg: Emma has a question. Emma Green: I was struck by what you said about the old times at The Atlantic, and I definitely agree with you that The Atlantic we are now is much preferable to — Coates: Emma when did you come? Green: 2012. Coates: So you saw a little bit of this. Green: Yeah, we had the little heads on the side of the web site, all the white dudes. Coates: Right. Green: So I definitely agree that we are a better place. We do more interesting work I think than when I first got here, but I think I’ve heard you talk about this — I’ve definitely heard Conor talk about this. I think I’ve even heard Jim talk about this, I don’t want to speak for you guys — but a certain amount of nostalgia for that time, which was the ability to just get out there and punch each other and people debating and actually having genuinely different ideas and having that spirit of really wanting to engage. And we just don’t have that anywhere on our website. So I wonder if you think this Kevin Williamson affair represents the impossibility of getting back to any version of that, or if there is some version of that that we could get back and how. Coates: Yeah, I think there is. I think it’s just, where are the lines going to be? I mean, it’s not like among my friends, who are closer to me ideologically, there are no debates to be had. Are we — and you guys would know this better than me so correct me if I’m wrong — did we really well represent, for instance, the debate between the Sanders wing of the Democratic Party and the Clinton — you know, I’m being really crude in my statements — and the Clinton wing of the Democratic Party? Have we done a good job representing that? Do we have folks that can write aggressively and write really well to represent that [inaudible]? I mean, that’s an actual debate. It’s a vivid, real debate — and we could have that! There’s no reason why we couldn’t have that right now. And I don’t think that’s — I think it’s better than me having to debate Andrew about genes and IQ. I think that’s much, much more substantial and would be an improvement. So I think we can get back to it. Green: It’s possible that we have people here who could do Sanders-Clinton if they were encouraged to do that. But do we have anybody who could do Ben Sasse-Rubio-Trump-Ted Cruz? I mean, do we have anybody who could do that? Not really, right? Maybe Conor. Coates: No, that’s true. But again, that just takes me back to the question that was asked over here. Like, is what Kevin Williamson ... this is why it was such a provocative challenge for us, as far as I’m concerned. How far out of the wheelhouse of Rubio and Ben Sasse is Kevin Williamson? Or did he just say it in a certain type of way? So for me, it takes us back to, OK, so why was he fired again? Or not hired; I guess he wasn’t fired. But why is he not here again? You know? Goldberg: Gillian, why don’t you go on in here? Gillian White: So I guess my question is, when we talk about the representation of some of the ideas and beliefs that Williamson held, I think a lot of us are of the mind that it is fine and appropriate and necessary to have somebody arguing those things on The Atlantic’s platform. I think the issue comes with whether or not it’s a civil discourse. And that is the thing that I think a lot of people feel when they talk about “spirit of generosity.” I think there are a lot of Americans and a lot of writers and a lot of people who could articulate a pro-life stance — and a lot of these other stances — who maybe have not been described in the same way as Williamson has. I mean, you just called him a troll. He’s been described as pugnacious. Do we not think that there’s a space between civil discourse and people who are being described as right-wing trolls and pugnacious and all those other things? Do we not think that there’s someplace that exists where people can represent those opinions in a civil discourse on this platform? Goldberg: Can I say something quick on that? I actually think — and I hope I’m not embarrassing him by saying this, and I don’t even know if he’s watching this — but I think we have on our team one of the best practitioners of exactly what you’re talking about, Conor Friedersdorf, who should be a model for everyone. What Conor does is — I mean, we talked about this this morning, I’m sorry for those of you who are hearing this again — what Connor does is, he has an argument he wants to make. He takes the opposition’s argument, characterizes it fairly, gives it its full due, and then systematically but civilly dismantles it to the best of his ability. Right? And that’s the most Atlantic-ish thing there is. So, you know, I think it’s completely possible to do that and not touch the third rail of outrageous language, or crazy over-the-line talk. I mean, we have a lot of other people who do that as well. I’m using Conor, in part, because, if we’re being honest here, Conor is outside the political mainstream, I would think, of this room but a valued and hugely important member of this family Coates: But Conor is also not within the mainstream of conservative thought, either. Goldberg: No, but… Well, Conor is very heterodoxical, so he does all kinds of things, but — Coates: So there’s certainly room for that. I would definitely agree with that. But I think the bigger challenge is, and I think this is what Gillian was pointing to, could you articulate those ideas and — again, I just drive back to, then what did he actually do wrong? Is it what he said? Is it how he said it? You know, I’m skeptical, man. And I think part of this is the ground. I think it’s the change with the makeup of The Atlantic. I think it’s Trump. I think the ground has actually shifted. You know, should we build the wall is a mainstream debate. These ideas have now been mainstreamed. And so, is it our job, then, to represent things that, you know, that I think are absolutely batshit crazy just because they’re within the consensus? Again, where is the line? I don’t know, man. I have a hard time with the Williamson thing because what offends me is not how he said it. Like, I get why that was a problem for The Atlantic and the look. Like, there’s a PR argument for that. But when I start breaking down those beliefs, I’m like, but is he outside of the mainstream of conservative thought? You’re talking about a party that only a couple years ago — and I don’t know where these numbers are now — but only a couple of years ago, a majority of people believed that the president of the United States was born in Kenya. I mean, that’s a profound challenge to an organ that says it wants to have a robust debate between the poles of this country. Goldberg: So should we be part of the resistance? Coates: No, because we’re journalists. No. I’m not part of no resistance. I’m not an activist at all. You know, as I made the mistake and publicly said, you know I criticized Bernie Sanders and voted for him, both. The same thing — I shouldn’t have said that. I shouldn’t have said who I voted for. But no, I mean, but that’s the difference. I don’t have to write things that endorse the people — you know, I generally was a fan of Obama. But I criticized him all the time here because I’m a journalist. You understand? Like, no. I’m not part of any resistance. At all. Goldberg: Not you. What about us? Coates: No, no. Absolutely not. Absolutely not. For instance, a story I would love to see — no, I’m not gonna say it. I might be taking somebody’s story, sorry. Because I’ve talked about it with other Atlantic people, and I don’t want to claim credit for it. There’s a great story in this room about a very, very liberal place in America that for some reason can’t fix something that liberals claim that they could fix. I would love to see that story here. Goldberg: Will somebody text me later who’s working on that? Coates: They should. I’ll have them come to you privately because it’s their idea, and it was a great fucking idea. Goldberg: I’m looking for great fucking ideas! Speaking of great fucking ideas, here’s Jim Fallows. James Fallows: So I have a question that flows actually logically from what Carolyn and Emma and Gillian were saying, and what you all were both discussing. And this is a question I don’t have an answer for, and I don’t expect you, Jeff, to have an answer for now, but I think it’s a useful way to think about what we do next. In this case, it really has become impossible to separate the case that Kevin was making from the way he was making it. And there’s a whole sort of side terrain here. A particular tell that was really most significant to me was his explanation for why he said the little guy in Detroit was three-fifths of a person. He said, well, I’m six foot he was four foot. It just came naturally. When I hear six and four, I think two-thirds. [laughter] You know, I don’t think three-fifths. That’s something you have to have, um, there’s a different weight to that. Goldberg: Oh, showing off your math skills now. Fallows: But I think the question is, is related to what you were just saying, Ta-Nehisi, there are arguments that we — that I personally — wouldn’t agree with, but if made in a respectful, patient way, we’d want to have part of our realm. I think we can agree on ones that would not be in that realm. Many of you know here Jared Taylor, a guy who was once my friend in Japan. He makes a very respectful, erudite argument for racial superiority. He’s a complete, unapologetic racist, and we would not, should not publish his argument, no matter how well it was made.  We shouldn’t publish anti-Semitic arguments, no matter how well made. We shouldn’t publish birther arguments. Even though I personally am anti-death penalty across the board, because I think it’s discriminatory and too many mistakes, even though I think Roe v. Wade is both the settled law of the land and should be the law of the land, I can imagine us publishing a respectful, sane argument by somebody who said, I view abortion as murder, therefore I’m willing to carry my argument to its extreme and at least we make that case. I guess the question is, to define over time, what arguments — even if made in the best way — we would not countenance as part of our discourse Goldberg: It’s interesting because I think most of us know what those arguments are. We know them intuitively, and 99.9 percent of the time, our own editorial filtration systems work almost unconsciously, like they never actually emerge to be considered in a kind of way. I think that’s a thing worth noting. Making lists of things — I mean, this has come up from time to time, what don’t we do. It’s impossible because this is not a laboratory, you know. And it is not boxes, and things change and realities shift. Maybe 20, 30 years from now, The Atlantic will never publish an anti-choice piece, an anti-abortion piece. Maybe 50, 60 years from now, The Atlantic is going to publish on the cover that abortion is murder. I don’t know.  We don’t know because things shift. But I generally know when it’s my job, and it’s the job of other senior editors, to in a very live way, constantly think about where the parameters are and where the lines are. And I think, I disagree with Ta-Nehisi in the sense that, to me, the breaking point is, in this previous case, is the civility case, the “spirit of generosity” case. It’s like, you know, there’s a certain kind of writer who directs his merciless writing at powerful people, and we love that. But you know, there’s something implicit — the only thing that’s implicit to me in our journalism, implicit in the term “spirit of generosity” that manifests itself in our journalism, is we have to be merciful toward the weak. You have to start from position of, at least, understanding or empathy or something when it’s the weak. And this is where maybe things fell apart a little bit. But I think the lines are generally — I mean, am I wrong in thinking that? Coates: How do — how do you — Goldberg: I’m not running racist pieces, obviously. Coates: No, no, no. But how do you make, and maybe I didn’t quite hear you correctly, and if I didn’t, just correct me here — how do you make a civil argument for the death penalty for a procedure that huge numbers of Americans undertake right now? Fallows: So I’m saying, I entirely disagree with that perspective. I can imagine someone, you know, if Ross, our former guy, if he were pro-death penalty, I could imagine him making that case. Saying that he understands the brutal logic of what he’s saying. He understands this is not the civil law of the country for the last four-plus decades. He understands the tens of millions of people who would be affected, all of them women, but he nonetheless goes this way. Would we countenance that if he made that case? Goldberg: I ... Me? Probably not? I mean, I don’t know. I mean it’s a live thing. I’d have to read the thing and understand what the thing is. But you know, I just, I mean, going back to the point that Emma’s making, it’s like the Wild West — Coates: How do women in this room feel about that? Goldberg: Well, one of the things I would do is like, run it by — Coates: No, I mean like right now. Because we’re having this very abstract, theoretical argument — Goldberg: Are you taking a poll? Coates: No, I mean, we don’t have to take a poll. Somebody has the mic right now. Female staffer: [inaudible] I question whether his argument was made in the best way. If he’s not saying that men whose child this also is should also face the death penalty. [inaudible]. Fallows: And suppose he said that, too, suppose you were willing to embrace that in the argument. You know, until two days ago, we were hiring on our staff somebody who had this view. So we were willing, until two days ago, to countenance this view until we knew sort of all the peripheral stuff about how he was expressing it. Male staffer: Well, we’d countenance this view among our writers, not necessarily in our pages — that’s the distinction Jeff is making. Goldberg: Well, right. We weren’t countenancing the view, and this goes to — and by the way, this is an important thing for everybody who writes in the web age and social media age — we weren’t countenancing the view. He wasn’t going to write that for us. Right? And this goes back to the first iteration of this, which is the second-chance thing. The possibility that writers can grow and be better under the tutelage and guidance of The Atlantic. And so, I have a lot more tolerance for what I would consider to be mistakes people made at other organizations but show other talents than I would — it wouldn’t happen here because I don’t think our filters would let it happen. But we all are very well aware of the fact that everything that we say can and will be held against us in the court of social media opinion. Right? And so I don’t think that’s ... I think Bob’s right. It’s not something that he was going to do here. It’s the question of, is this characterologically where we’re at? And that was the question that sort of came up yesterday or the day before. Male staffer: I think the [inaudible] question is, from Gillian and from Jim, is whether — and Ta-Nehisi’s view is clear — whether, Jeff, you might have been comfortable publishing Kevin Williamson in a civil way on this point that Gillian ― Goldberg: On this particular point? Male staffer: Yeah, on this particular point, that I am pro-life and pro-death penalty, and I’m going to take that to the logical conclusion. And he’d done it in a Ross Douthat-style, Conor Friedersdorf-style voice, which Kevin doesn’t have. He’s a thoughtful person, but didn’t have that voice in his — Goldberg: I’m going to answer you — and I’m not dodging this — this meeting is so meta I can’t even stand it. Coates: You’ve got a woman with the microphone. That would make it less meta. Goldberg: I know, and I’m going to — Coates: We should — Goldberg: No, no, no. But let me answer his question and Rosa can come — and it goes to that point. The first thing I would do — I mean, one of the reasons that I’ve tried to promote so many women to leadership roles is because I want a lot of women in leadership roles so, when those questions arise, I can just say Adrienne [LaFrance], Swati [Sharma], Sarah [Zhang], Gillian [B. White], whoever, what do you think of this? Like, real experience. I think if Andrew — I mean, you had a problem with Andrew — I think Andrew trafficked in anti-Semitism. And I would have liked to have somebody talk about that when we were fighting it out all the time. You know, that’s why we have that. And I think I would put that piece first, up for discussion, with people who were actually that group, and let them actually think it through and then give me their advice and then make decisions accordingly. Rosa Smith: So, one thing that I’ve been thinking about, a common theme across all these questions, it seems to me that when we define the “spirit of generosity” as, sort of, the ability to accept other ideas or accept a wide range of ideas, that burden can sometimes fall heavier on some people than on others. Like as Ta-Nehisi pointed out, this question of hanging women who get abortions, it felt extremely personal, I think, for a lot of the women in this room. And so I’m wondering whether you define — sorry, I’m going to be one more person who asks whether you define the spirit of generosity primarily in terms of civility. And if so, how you would want to account for the fact that we can’t, as journalists, always separate ourselves from our ideas and the ideas that we’re able to take in. And the fact that an idea that some people might be able to think of as an abstract is very, very personal for someone else. Coates: I think that’s for you, Jeff. [laughter]. Goldberg: No, no, no. You can be the editor for a minute. Coates: I don’t think that’s for me. Goldberg: So, I’m going to give you the hard-edged answer. The hard-edged answer is that we’re journalists, and you have to separate how you feel from who you cover and what you write about. Very quickly, I spent half my career covering people, interviewing people, being with people who literally want to kill me—and six or seven times tried. OK? So, like, fine, whatever. I lived with the Taliban. I know they didn’t like me. And I’m not — but my job is to explain them, and be in their shoes and... I have a high tolerance. Part of the problem here might have been that I have an insensitivity or a high tolerance to offense. It just builds up. Right? That said, you know, as an editor I’m like, you know, this is not a safe space. This is The Atlantic. We’re a robust magazine of ideas and reported opinion and everything else. And so we all have to deal with the fact that we’re gonna work with people and with ideas that we just don’t like, and we’re going to come in proximity to them. On the other hand, as a manager, I want to make sure that everybody feels good and safe at their workplace and all of the things related to having a healthy, positive environment where there’s cohesion and a common purpose and everybody feels like they’re coming in and doing something positive and useful, and they don’t feel oppressed in the place that they work. That’s a complicated answer. I mean, I don’t want — but friction, on the other hand, is what makes really interesting journalism. And so we have to live in a kind of unhappy balance sometimes. But obviously, and I hope people know this about me by now, I really do love the people I work with. And I don’t want to do anything that ever hurts anyone. So that’s where I sort of am right now. Male staffer: With regards to Williamson, I just wanted to highlight the Laverne Cox piece, which I sometimes feel doesn’t really get discussed enough. And I think it was both very viciously argued and in a very unambiguous way. I thought about that while listening to Ta-Nehisi talk about being in an early newsroom with no people of color. I thought about that when, Jeff, you talked about a newsroom that made the decision to publish “The Bell Curve” without any oversight. And I guess I would encourage us to reflect on ways — on what our residual institutional blind spots still are, at The Atlantic. Even as we make good efforts to diversify our newsroom. Because we did not publish Kevin on Laverne Cox, but we did hire him, briefly, in spite of that. Goldberg: Well, I mean like I said very briefly I’m not going to hold everything — I mean, I agree with you on the piece, obviously. I’m not going hold everything that anyone ever said about anything against them when making those decisions. Maybe the calibration was off here, obviously. But yes, one of the reasons that we started the talent lab, and Christi … is here? I don’t know if Christi’s here. Hello, Christi. One of the reasons we’re trying to be very deliberate about thinking about where we’re underrepresented — and it’s not just underrepresentation for journalists. It’s underrepresentation because we want to bring in people who don’t know that they can be journalists and make them journalists, right? And so, obviously, I can’t sit here and make specific promises about a specific kind of hiring, but clearly, I think we’d be a better organization. You know, I just think we’re a better organization when you have people from all different walks of life and different backgrounds, and I mean ... I hope that you know that. Female staffer: Ta-Nehisi just threw a bit to the women in the audience by asking how we felt about hearing this conversation. I cannot speak for everyone. I know for me, hearing people discuss abortion and hanging as a punishment has been quite painful to hear, but I appreciate the spirit of this discussion and the fact that we’re having it. And I appreciate your asking that question, Ta-Nehisi, because I think understanding how people react to things is part of that conversation, even when it’s good. To me, when we talk about the logically complete argument around this, I see not just this idea of abortion and capital punishment, but then, this idea embedded within that — that the punishment for anybody who’s found culpable when it comes to a single homicide should be dead. Then it should be death by a means that many of us would consider barbaric, and that is not permitted even in states that allow the death penalty much of the time. So if someone were to have come to us with the argument that, you know, they believe that our criminal justice system should become much more punitive and more brutal and here are my reasons for it. And you know, if we find somebody guilty of murder even once, which is not always a capital offense, then we’re going to make it a capital offense — is that something that we as arbiters of the sphere of reasonable debate would have found tolerable more so if they hadn’t even begun with the abortion? Because I see that as the logically complete argument or the logical extension of that argument. Coates: I’m just answering this off the spot right now, so I can’t give a complete argument for this, but yeah, I’d be much more open to that. And I think part of it is the discriminatory nature of just putting it on — like, I’m not going to have an abortion. That’s never going to affect me at all. So I think part of it is the discriminatory nature of making it that way. Female staffer: Surfacing abortion as the main criteria when actually the question is, did you commit a homicide? Coates: I probably will be much more open to, as Jim said, a civil, well-reasoned — ugh — argument around that. Female staffer: Hard to envision that. Coates: But you know, it’s OK for me to go, “ugh.” I can do that. That doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be in the pages of The Atlantic. I’m not going “ugh” like you shouldn’t publish that. Goldberg: The default position always has to be, we’re going to publish something, an argument, unless there’s a very good reason not to do it. You know what I mean? I always want to leave it. Why, you know, not “let’s not even go near something,” [but] “let’s think about the hard things and figure out can we do this.” I always lean in favor of, like, “let’s explore it, and let’s push out and see where we’re at.” I think we have time for one more question. Christi, do you wanna? Christi Parsons: Thank you. Hi, I’m Christi. Appreciate this introduction to Atlantic culture this week. Week one. I don’t recall a conversation like this at the L.A. Times. Goldberg: There are more immediate problems at the L.A. Times. Parsons: Yeah, exactly. This is a nice luxury to have. Very often men who speak glibly about violence against women also turn out to be harassers in the workplace. I’m not making that accusation in this specific case. I just want to note that this seems like a moment when you can talk about your commitment to protecting the workplace and the culture of The Atlantic at a moment when you’re about to bring in an awful lot of new people in a really fast hurry. Goldberg: Yeah, I mean, thank you, Christi. And this is a simple one. I mean, those of you were here over the last year know that David and Bob and me and every other manager, we’ve been addressing this — especially since November, since the Weinstein thing. You know we have, I mean, we’re OK? [knocks on wood] You know, and the Atlantic culture I think you’ll experience is very strong. And the civility culture is very strong. And I’ve made it as clear as I possibly can that there’s zero tolerance for anything of the sort on the whole range of things that can go wrong in an organization related to this. There’s absolutely zero tolerance. We are a majority-female organization. We have, over the last year and a half, brought up a lot of women into leadership roles, not because they’re women but because I wanted to make a concerted effort to level the playing field so that women could get into leadership roles. I know from reading and talking to other people that having women in leadership roles in organizations doesn’t actually preclude the possibility of — NPR being a good example — the possibility of things happening. But I think everybody knows that the thing that we want to most defend against is the possibility that any woman would suffer in any way from the depredations that we’ve seen across the industry. Where was the other question? Vann Newkirk: I imagine when this Atlantic University was planned, we were going to talk about something else. The reason why we are talking about this is because Ta-Nehisi has become, even in some ways more than Kevin Williamson, the avatar of this conversation. I think [The National Review Online] has spilled more ink on you than they have on Kevin. Coates: Is that true? Newkirk: Well, when David French did the piece quoting both of you, he quoted you and did not quote Kevin. But it’s interesting. I mean you’ve seen all things about what you’ve written that might be considered beyond the pale. You’ve seen it. It seems to me that we are having a conversation resting on something of your moral authority, your role in this. As Jeff said, not in the hiring position, but in lending some sort of moral credence to what we do here at The Atlantic. How do you feel about that? And, Jeff, is that a sustainable thing? Goldberg: What do you mean sustainable? Newkirk: That we have a person like Ta-Nehisi, who is an amazing journalist and person and friend to many of us, who is sort of the ongoing center of many of these conversations about who we are and what we do. Goldberg: Is it sustainable? Coates: No, I understand what he’s saying. I understand exactly what he’s saying. Goldberg: You mean as a moral insurance policy? Or as a person who becomes a lightning rod for a lot of what is said about The Atlantic? Newkirk: I mean, I think it’s both. The lightning rod is part of the package. Coates: I understand what he’s saying. No, it’s not sustainable. Goldberg: Well, I’m not — your question is complicated. Coates: He’s saying, in the course of this debate, when people want to define what is tolerable for The Atlantic or what The Atlantic is willing to do, I’m brought up as evidence of it. Goldberg: And I don’t give a shit. Coates: Yeah, yeah, but maybe you don’t give a shit because — and I’m just being clear — because it’s not you. And also — Goldberg: Oh, you mean — no, I don’t give a shit what people say about you. Coates: That’s what I’m saying, well maybe you don’t give a shit ... [laughter] Goldberg: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. In terms of people pressuring me to do something about — Coates: No, I don’t think that’s Vann’s question. That’s not Vann’s question. It’s not “are you gonna fire Ta-Nehisi?” That’s not his question. Goldberg: No, no. I mean, no, no. Because you’re triggering me here because I get a lot of stuff about him. I get a lot of stuff about a lot of people. Coates: That’s his point, though. And not in “are you gonna fire ...?” Like, is it healthy in general. Everybody knows where you are in this. I mean, it’s not “are you going to fire this dude?” Goldberg: Is it healthy — what’s the healthy or unhealthy thing? Coates: Is it healthy to have — Goldberg: No, I mean, I’m sorry, because I got all self-righteous in my mind. And I was going to say — I mean, look, it’s very hard for me to disaggregate the professional Ta-Nehisi from the personal Ta-Nehisi because — Coates: Can you maybe repeat the question? Goldberg: No, I mean, I want to say that. I just feel the need to say this. I mean he’s one of the dearest people in my life. I’d die for him. So like — Coates: That’s not what he’s asking! Goldberg: I know! But — [laughter]. Coates: We all know that! Goldberg: No, I want you to know that. Coates: We all know this. That’s not his question, though. He’s clear on that. Goldberg: No, I want you to know that. Coates: I do know that! Goldberg: Can’t I just express my love for you? What’s so bad? What’s so wrong? Coates: Can I just say — and I would only say this sitting in this room — but that was a very white response. [laughter]. Goldberg: I’m very white! Why was it white? Coates: Because you’re going to this question of, I’m trying to prove, you know, I’m a good ally. I’m part of this. Goldberg: No! Coates: “I love Ta-Nehisi.” But that’s not actually what he’s asking. Goldberg: Well, I didn’t understand. I would die for Ross Anderson. He’s one of the whitest guys I know. Coates: That’s still very white, though — nobody is asking you to die! Goldberg: No! But — all right, fine. What’s the question, Vann? [crosstalk] Newkirk: What I’m asking is, he’s become, and I think this is fair, more than the sum of his journalism and what he does, the center of a conversation around who we are, what we do and what’s allowable here. And I was asking if that is a desirable position for us to be in, and if that’s a sustainable position for Ta-Nehisi and for you? Staffer: That’s not something we create though, right? Newkirk: I think we do in some ways. Goldberg: I mean, all we are and all The Atlantic is is the sum total of the people who work at The Atlantic and write for The Atlantic and edit The Atlantic, in a very basic way. And so, Ta-Nehisi was hired 10 years ago to do a thing, and because he’s Ta-Nehisi and because The Atlantic is The Atlantic he became a very famous person. I really, I’m not, I’m not tracking the question. I feel like Ta-Nehisi is, and I feel like Jim is the same thing, and a lot of other people — Megan is the same thing, you’re the same thing. And Conor and David Frum and all of that is The Atlantic together, and it’s hard to define that group. Right? And I’d like for things to be in a little bit of balance in those questions so it’s easy easier to explicate what we are and who we are. Of all the problems, that doesn’t strike me as a problem. Does it strike you as a problem? Coates: Yes! Goldberg: Well, why? Why does it strike you as a problem? Coates: Well, go ahead Vann, go. Don’t let me — Newkirk: I mean, I think if any of us swapped positions with Ta-Nehisi and were put in the position to be that moral authority, it would be a difficult position. And I think each of us who may be in line to be in the line of fire, perhaps, would say that’s a perhaps undesirable position. Coates: Well, I don’t think with just the sum total of our parts. I mean, let’s flip it, man. Let’s flip it like this. If we didn’t have — if there was someone here who, for instance, had and — good idea, bad idea — had written a cover that said abortion should be legal, in all cases, everywhere, right now. And had we done that, probably you would have seen that person in that position instead of me. Do you understand? Like, I think part of why that’s the case is who gets opportunities, who is cultivated to make really, really aggressive arguments. And then also, once those arguments are made, who we promote. You know, I appreciate that. I appreciate what you just said about the talent and all that and all of that stuff. I appreciate that. But I do think the machine is part of it. Goldberg: Do you think the machine is conscious? Coates: No, no, no, no. But that effect is the same, so it really doesn’t matter. But I think, you know, Jeff, like you got props yesterday from Nicole for this. I really admire what you’re doing. And I respect that, you know—I really think that diversity piece is really, really important. But then what happens after that is, it raises — you know, you don’t just become diverse, and everybody says “yeah!” and claps. Goldberg: Well, yeah, you become different. Coates: No! You don’t just become different. You uncover other problems. So the very fact that Vann is in the room is the reason why we’re having this discussion right now. Whereas if Vann was not in the room, this wouldn’t even be — we wouldn’t have this discussion. More problems that you may not have seen when you said, “Hey, we’re going to become diverse that will be a great thing,” become revealed. So it’s like an ongoing process.  And so what he’s pointing to — and I think this will be true; I don’t think it’s just necessarily true of me, I think it would be true of anybody else in this position — is, why is that the case? And I think part of the reason that’s the case is, for a very, very long time, I was the only black writer here. And we are dealing with the effects of that. That don’t necessarily follow you, it don’t even necessarily follow Bob or, you know what I mean, I don’t think people were consciously trying to say, let’s not get any black folks here. Or let’s not get any writers of color here. But there are effects of that. I mean there’s no other person here who is making those sorts of aggressive arguments. So, yeah, it ends up that you say, OK, who can I find that says shit at The Atlantic that feels like it’s outside of the mainstream. So then you become the tentpole — and this is my therapy right now — you become A) well, they let that guy write this, why can’t Kevin Williamson do this, B) well, that guy likes Kevin Williamson, what are the rest of y’all complaining about? Like, I don’t have the right to my own private opinion. And I should have actually recognized that before I started talking. That was my mistake. But writers want to write. You know, writers don’t want to be that. You know, no writer really wants to be that. And I think one way The Atlantic can help with that — and I think The Atlantic’s already helping with that, though, you might not see dividends from it for another five years or so ― is that piece of making sure that as you bring these folks in, who have not traditionally been here, that they get the opportunity to make those aggressive arguments.  That those people are promoted in our events, in our outreach. You know, like the stuff Anna [Bross, senior communications director] does— whoever talks to the press — that those people are pushed in a certain kind of way. And then I think it becomes, you know, less easy to put that on one person. Goldberg: Yeah. I mean, my goal is to make it look like as much of America as we can. And I don’t want that burden to fall on one person from each group to be that spokesman and avatar.  ",I,’s,guys
"When we meet Dorothea ― the heroine of Mike Mills’ film “20th Century Women,” a 50-something mom played by Annette Bening ― it’s hard to know what to make of her. She’s not trying to make it big in Hollywood. She’s not trying to hunt down her rapist, or plan the perfect event to solidify her husband’s place in history. Her goals are less concrete than that, her successes less triumphant. And that could be why both Bening and Mills were snubbed this year at the Oscars, for Best Actress and Best Picture, respectively. The film opens with a shot of Dorothea’s immolated car, the last remnant of her failed marriage. It’s so old that it’s finally combusted, but she doesn’t mind. She laughs it off, and invites the fireman who’s come to her aide over for dinner, to her teenage son Jamie’s chagrin. Over the course of the film, we get to know her through her quirky habits, as narrated by Jamie. She’s generous, and lets Abbie (Greta Gerwig), a 20-something photographer battling cervical cancer, stay in her Santa Barbara home without always making rent. She’s old-fashioned and isn’t appreciative of Abbie’s menstruation talk at the dinner table. But she also knows the limits of her ‘50s convictions in a late ‘70s, punk-rock world. Realizing that she’s struggling to communicate with her son, she enlists Abbie and Jamie’s best friend Julie (Elle Fanning) to help raise him. “How do you be a good man?” she wonders. “I don’t know how you do that nowadays.” The film, to its credit, is both about Bening’s loosening off of domestic shackles and her attempt to raise a young man who’s a feminist ally, in the throes of the movement’s second wave. The latter storyline garnered criticism; why tell a feminist story through the lens of a boy? A review in the Village Voice observes that Mills’ references to Our Bodies, Ourselves and Sisterhood is Powerful feel “awkwardly exploited, inserted to salute not so much Jamie’s advisers — those first female readers — as the teenager himself.” It’s a thorny premise, certainly, especially when women’s stories are still undermined onscreen. But the movie, while told from Jamie’s point of view, belongs to Dorothea, and Bening, who outshines an impressive cast. It’s unlikely that the movie’s less progressive conception was its downfall in the eyes of the Academy, which has been criticized for favoring the narratives of those with power to those without it (lest we forget #OscarsSoWhite). But it wouldn’t be a jump to think that “20th Century Women” was overlooked due to what some critics count as its strength: it’s a mood piece, not a high-volume, crescendoing drama or musical. Compared with most of the films that did manage to secure Best Picture nominations — “La La Land,” “Manchester by the Sea,” “Hacksaw Ridge,” “Hidden Figures” — its plot is subdued, and at times meandering. Abbie gets involved with one of Dorothea’s other boarders; Jamie gets into David Byrne and his attendant subversiveness; Julie challenges her parents’ oppressive psychologizing. Dinner parties are had. A lot happens, but the stakes are low. Compare this with the Best Picture winners from the past few years ― “Spotlight,” “Argo,” “The King’s Speech,” “Slumdog Millionaire” and “The Departed,” especially ― and there’s a marked difference. Those movies are highly dramatized; Mills’ is anything but. Like his earlier movies, “Thumbsucker” and “Beginners,” “20th Century Women” is an autobiographical reflection of the director’s upbringing. Snapshots of cultural hallmarks and pastiche are woven into his stories like projector slides, an effect some critics find authentic, and others find gratuitously twee. No matter which side you fall on, it’s evident that Mills’ storytelling techniques neatly match the stories he sets out to tell. He’s not guilty of the Sofia Coppola-like tendency to shroud every scene, regardless of its subject matter, in diffuse light. Instead, he uses meandering, character-centered plots to heighten a sense of ennui, which Dorothea, who came of age in the ‘40s, suffers from. Like Hal in “Beginners,” a suburban father who only feels free to come out as gay after his wife dies, Dorothea is the product of a stifling time when gender roles were expected to be assumed.  To place her in a spacious story, one where she’s free to take up new hobbies, to make wry jokes, is an act of love. It also happens to be an entertaining experience for the viewer; Dorothea does have obstacles to overcome, namely casting off her own social conditioning. And that ― still, today ― is one of the most relatable conflicts there is. You can be highbrow. You can be lowbrow. But can you ever just be brow?

"“I am furious and dumbfounded,” Oregon-based theater producer Michael Streeter wrote on Facebook last week. “The Edward Albee Estate needs to join the 21st Century.” The short statement ― totaling just over 50 words ― claimed that the estate of the late Pulitzer-winning playwright had withdrawn the rights to his play “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,” disallowing Streeter from staging the well-known production in Portland. Its reason, according to the post? Streeter had cast a black actor in the supporting role of Nick. “The Albee Estate called and said I need to fire the black actor and replace him with a white one,” he added. “I refused, of course.” According to The New York Times, a spokesperson for the Albee estate maintains that it hadn’t exactly withdrawn Streeter’s permission to stage the play ― namely because it hadn’t provided explicit permission to begin with. But the spokesperson did confirm the crux of Streeter’s statement: It indeed objected to the casting of a black actor in the play. “It is important to note that Mr. Albee wrote Nick as a Caucasian character, whose blonde hair and blue eyes are remarked on frequently in the play, even alluding to Nick’s likeness as that of an Aryan of Nazi racial ideology,” spokesperson Sam Rudy allegedly wrote in a letter to Streeter. “Furthermore, Mr. Albee himself said on numerous occasions when approached with requests for nontraditional casting in productions of ‘Virginia Woolf’ that a mixed-race marriage between a Caucasian and an African-American would not have gone unacknowledged in conversations in that time and place and under the circumstances in which the play is expressly set by textual references in the 1960s.” “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf,” a widely adapted play, centers on husband-and-wife duo George and Martha, whose lack of marital bliss becomes the central conflict of a night of drinking with a younger couple, Nick and Honey. First staged in 1962, Albee ― known to demand creative control over various productions of his play ― originally conceived the play’s characters as white, including, as Rudy pointed out, a description of Nick that involves the word “blond.” Streeter, in a subsequent Facebook post, explained his “color-conscious” casting choice further: I believe casting Nick as black adds depth to the play. The character is an up and comer. He is ambitious and tolerates a lot of abuse in order to get ahead. I see this as emblematic of African Americans in 1962, the time the play was written. The play is filled with invective from Martha and particularly George towards Nick. With each insult that happens in the play, the audience will wonder, ‘Are George and Martha going to go there re. racial slurs?’ There are lines that I think this casting gives resonance to, such as the fact that his (white) wife has ‘slim hips’ and when he says he’s ‘nobody’s houseboy’. He is a biologist and it is suggested that he is looking to make everyone the same. (Nazism and Arianism is implied, but never specifically mentioned.) This could be a reasonable goal or fantasy for an African American biologist in 1962 for the distant future.  He went on to say that he does “not question the motives of those that made the decision” on behalf of the estate, adding that he believes “they have some fealty to a sense of integrity to Edward Albee’s desires.” “But I had hoped the negative aspects of Albee would die with him,” he concluded. “All I did was post a very short Facebook rant about my disappointment in their decision. I think they made the wrong one. I think the benefits of casting Nick with an African American Actor outweigh the drawbacks.” Streeter also acknowledged that the estate had not yet granted him full rights to stage the play at Shoebox Theater, in a production originally scheduled for this fall; rather, his ability to move forward rested on receiving casting approval from the estate.  The Times noted that Albee had previously issued concern regarding the potential casting of a black actress as Martha, the daughter of a college president: “That would instantly raise a lot of questions, since it’s a totally naturalistic play,” he said. “Is this a black college? Do we have a black president of a white college? Not very likely.” According to The Guardian, Albee also took action in order to halt a version of the play with two gay couples. The estate’s refusal to grant rights to Streeter has reinvigorated conversations about colorblind and color-conscious casting in theater ― the latter technique being one that was famously employed by Lin-Manuel Miranda’s production of “Hamilton.” Several theater fans even remarked on seeing “Virginia Woolf” with actors of color before. Streeter himself wondered whether or not the casting of an interracial couple in particular was the sole reason for the estate refusing to grant rights. “I think if I had proposed an all black cast they may have been more open to approving it,” he wrote. Still, the estate’s reasoning fell flat for many. “The reasoning, if that’s quite the word, of the Albee estate doesn’t seem to be simple racism,” Scott Simon explained on NPR. “It sounds like convoluted racism.” “This is terrible,” journalist Mark Harris wrote on Twitter. “I don’t know if this reflects Albee’s wish. If it does, that wish should not have survived him.” The husband of the actress originally cast as Martha in Streeter’s production took to Facebook to post his reaction, too: “While we are Whitewashing our movies and pop culture on a daily basis (Emma Stone as Native Hawaiian in ‘Aloha,’ Zach McGowan as a native Hawaiian, David Carradine as a Chinese man in ‘Kung Fu’?! and how about JESUS CHRIST as a blonde-haired, blue-eyed, white guy?!?!) we have a responsibility to #Resist these weak excuses for allowing racism to exist.” UPDATE: In an email to HuffPost, Streeter explained that he believes the recent coverage of his play has amounted to a “new and ongoing discussion of the issues of authorial control, particularly after the author’s death, and diversity in casting. I see these as positive developments.” When asked whether there have been any other developments in the story since news of the Albee estate’s decision broke, he added that he is “pursuing a new play to produce. It will take some time.” HuffPost has reached out to the Edward Albee estate by way of the Edward Albee Foundation for comment and will update this post accordingly if and when we hear back.",I,see,developments
"Amid the mushrooming revelations stemming from the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment scandal, the spotlight has shifted to another high profile industry with a power imbalance: Congress. According to a February 2017 Roll Call story, four in 10 women on congressional staff said that sexual harassment is a problem on Capitol Hill. “One in six said they personally had been victimized.” But unlike other federal agencies and private workplaces, in Congress there is no consistent system in place for responding to and preventing sexual harassment and assault. In 1995, the Congressional Accountability Act was passed after a series of scandals rocked the halls of Congress. The law requires Congress to follow many workplace laws that other employers must follow, including those addressing discrimination. The law created the Office of Compliance (“OOC”) to help members and congressional staffers understand their rights and responsibilities, but its authority only goes so far. Each Congressional office operates somewhat independently, with its own rules and procedures. Sexual harassment training is not mandatory for members or their staff, although OOC has urged otherwise for years. There’s no central HR department on the Hill, making it harder for individuals to know where to go to report harassment or assault or seek assistance. As a recent letter from former Hill staffers pointed out, few people know that they can turn to the Office of Compliance if they are the victim of sexual harassment or assault, even though harassment remains a longstanding and significant problem in Congress. When staffers do report harassment to the office, they must navigate a labyrinth of obstacles in order to seek justice, as the Washington Post recently reported. First, employees must submit to a “dispute resolution process” that is overseen by the Office of Compliance. OOC does not have the authority to conduct an investigation. Instead, the OOC process requires employees who have experienced harassment to first participate in 30 days of counseling. The requirement is imposed on the victim — not the alleged perpetrator. Employees must then submit to a 30-day mediation program where the parties meet separately or jointly with a mediator appointed by the Office of Compliance in an attempt to come to a “resolution” regarding the alleged violation. As the Washington Post noted, “[w]hen settlements do occur, members do not pay them from their own office funds, a requirement in other federal agencies. Instead, the confidential payments come out of a special U.S. Treasury fund.” Thus there is no accountability for the members or their offices, and no incentive to change behavior. And only after fulfilling mandatory counseling and mediation, followed by a 30 day “cooling off” period, may an employee press a claim in a judicial or administrative forum. Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), who has introduced legislation that would require all that members of Congress and staff undergo sexual harassment training every year, said that the entire process “is not a victim-friendly process. It is an institution-protection process.” Many survivors of sexual harassment and assault never report because the risk of retaliation and job loss is too great. A procedure rife with delay, a lack of accountability, and no real remedy provides even less incentive to come forward. Congress can take several immediate steps to reform its ineffective and cumbersome system. First, the House of Representatives should pass Rep. Speier’s legislation mandating training. A Senate companion bill introduced by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) passed last week. It would be a first, but important step, in showing that Congress is serious about developing an effective, consistent prevention and response policy regarding sexual harassment. Second, Congress should revise the statute that governs the Office of Compliance to remove existing barriers to reporting, and strengthen the process for addressing complaints in a manner that results in real consequences for people who discriminate and harass. Public Citizen has been fighting for more than 40 years for an open and accessible court system for all. National Women’s Law Center has worked for forty-five years to protect and promote equality and opportunity for women and families. Congressional staffers deserve nothing less. Maya Raghu is Director of Workplace Equality & Senior Counsel at the National Women’s Law Center. Remington A.

" Ute Lemper, the acclaimed German chanteuse, bares her continental soul at the inviting 54 Below nightclub, downstairs from Studio 54, tonight and tomorrow. The great Kurt Weill interpreter is taking a departure from her acclaimed repertoire. Noted for her charismatic delivery of Weimar-era classics, Lemper navigates a more intimate musical universe in Songs From the Broken Heart.  Her current incarnation features a few Brechtian numbers from the streets of Berlin. But the evening isn't a showcase of her classic Fritz Hollander or Jacques Brel numbers.  It's a more personal journey that traverses her interior landscape, addressing the pain of life. She showcases her musical artistry, using the poetry of Charles Bukowski or Pablo Neruda for inspiration. Her sensitivity to suffering is pronounced. This is art as introspection, searching for the truth of existence. Themes of death, love and redemption permeate her oeuvre. So does humor. She manages, in the guise of Mac the Knife, to take theatrical swipes at Donald Trump.  Though singing numbers in French, German, English and Yiddish, Broken Heart focuses on a more modern repertoire -- Lemper interprets the songs of Nick Cave, Philip Glass and Tom Waits, backed by an accomplished quartet. Her range, much like her electric rapport with the audience, is legendary. Lemper doesn't just sing, she embodies her music. And it achieves added resonance by the historic, political and cultural backdrop in which she carefully sets her selections. Lempers's nightclub performances -- versus the large concert-hall venues she regularly plays in Europe and Canada -- are sexy and intimate. She's been known to entice people on stage and tease audiences with her ""boa moment."" Such external stagecraft has been replaced by a quieter, more reflective mood.  ""Hell is built piece by piece,"" she sings; in a jazzy rendition of emotional infernos. She has, as Eugene O'Neill wrote, ""a touch of the poet."" Lemper strips away life's pretense and vanity; our tortured souls are her canvas -- and she executes her portraits with a masterful hand. A second global import, Confucius, a new dance drama performed by the China National Opera & Dance Drama Theater at Lincoln Center, is a hypnotic production headed to Washington, D.C. Jan. 13-15.  The opera tells the tale of the famous scholar's journey through the kingdoms of the Zhua Dynasty and his quest to bring a philosophy of benevolence, harmony and righteousness to its decadent, indifferent ruler.  Boasting traditional Chinese music, stunning costumes (Yang Donglin) and set design (Ren Dongsheng), the show is told in six sections. Set during a chaotic time in Chinese history, the 55-strong ensemble delivers a mesmerizing performance, aided by a compelling Hu Yang as Confucius and Tang Shiyi as Concubine.

"(Reuters) - Chuck Blazer, the former FIFA executive committee member who pleaded guilty to racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering, has died, his lawyers said on Wednesday. A statement from Blazer’s two lawyers did not provide details or the circumstances of his death. The New York Times said he had died of rectal cancer, which he had suffered for years. Blazer, 72, was general secretary of the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) from 1990 to 2011. He pleaded guilty in the United States to bribery and financial offenses in 2013 and was later banned by FIFA from all football activities for life.  According to the transcript of his November 2013 guilty plea, Blazer and others in FIFA agreed to accept bribes in the bidding process for the 1998 World Cup in France and the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. FIFA’s ethics committee said Blazer breached rules on loyalty, confidentiality, duty of disclosure, conflicts of interest, offering and accepting gifts, and bribery and corruption. As part of the 2013 plea agreement, Blazer agreed to cooperate with investigating authorities in the United States while they investigated the FIFA corruption scandal, which eventually played a crucial role in the departure of its former president, Sepp Blatter. Blazer had accused another former CONCACAF president, Jack Warner, of having pocketed funds from a $10 million project to support the African diaspora in Caribbean countries at the time of South Africa’s successful bid to stage the 2010 World Cup.  FIFA opened an ethics investigation over bribes-for-votes allegations in the 2011 FIFA presidential election after Blazer reported a possible case of bribery between Blatter and then FIFA presidential candidate Mohamed Bin Hammam.  Warner and Bin Hammam were also banned by FIFA for life.   FIFA was not immediately available for a comment on Blazer’s death. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Brooklyn, which is overseeing the FIFA probe, did not respond to a request for comment. Blazer was born on April 26, 1945 in New York, according to the New York Times. He worked as a salesman and coached his son’s soccer games in New Rochelle, New York, in the late 1970s before beginning his rise in international soccer. Blazer kept a blog detailing his travels and his meetings with dignitaries, celebrities and politicians, including a visit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2010. “At one moment, he looked at me with a very serious gaze and said, without cracking a smile, “You know, you look like Karl Marx!” Blazer wrote. In one blog post, the white-bearded Blazer posted a photo of himself dressed in a red Santa Claus suit smiling as he peered over a pair of eye glasses. In another, Blazer posted a video of Max, his blue and gold parrot, dancing as he stood on the front of a scooter in Central Park near a group of jazz musicians. “Go max, go. It’s ok,” a man’s voice, purportedly Blazer’s, is heard on the video. Blazer was on a motorized scooter along Fifth Avenue in New York in November of 2011 when federal agents approached him, the New York Daily News reported. “We can take you away in handcuffs now, or you can cooperate,” the agents told him, according to the newspaper. He cooperated. His then-domestic partner, Mary Lynn Blanks, told Reuters in a 2016 article that she accompanied Blazer to soccer-related events while he was acting as an informant for U.S. investigators, sometimes wearing a bugging device.",Blazer,said,gifts
"This summer, a cast entirely comprised of senior actors starred in an adaptation of the 1977 bittersweet romcom “Annie Hall.” “With all due respect to Woody Allen’s creative and comic writing genius,” Shula Chernick, who plays the titular Annie in the film, told HuffPost. “I think our version is much funnier.”  New York-based artists Ellie Sachs and Matt Starr conceived of the project, dreaming up the possibility of creating a movie with an elderly cast on their first date. Starr, who is 28, had already developed a ritual of reenacting classic films with his grandmother Maxine, who has Alzheimer’s. The practice began when Starr realized that, as Maxine got older, their conversations started running in circles, returning again and again to the same simple questions. “I realized we probably weren’t going to have a normal relationship anymore,” Starr confessed.  Yet when Starr and Maxine sat down together to watch “Casablanca,” she began murmuring Ingrid Bergman’s lines from the film under her breath. Starr chimed in as Humphrey Bogart and the two fell into a happy rapport. Starr relayed the experience to Sachs on their date, adding, “I’d love to do this on a larger scale.” She was just the woman to make it happen.  Sachs’ background is in theater. Having worked at prisons, community centers, settlement houses and schools around the country, she was confident they could find a venue to give their idea, of working with seniors to interpret and reenact classic films, a shot.  “We were met with a lot of resistance,” Sachs recalled. “A lot of elderly centers didn’t think their populations could handle it.” Eventually, however, they found a home for their brainchild: Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, located in Manhattan’s Upper East Side.   In March, Sachs and Starr began teaching an Interpretive Cinema class at Lenox Hill. They watched and discussed scenes from films including “Annie Hall,” “Manhattan,” “Casablanca,” “Rear Window,” and “Singin’ in the Rain.” They invited those in the class to vote on which one they’d like to appear in. The class selected “Annie Hall,” which follows the romance between Alvy Singer, an overanxious comedian, and Annie Hall, a breezy and capricious nightclub singer. The more Sachs and Starr mulled over the fragmented framework of the film, the more it seemed to mirror some of the issues their actors grappled with during the aging process. “It’s a memory movie,” Sachs explained. “It tells a story in a nonlinear fashion. It comes down to the question of: What do we remember and why do we remember it? It’s a beautiful comparison to what some of our students might be experiencing.” Many of the actors are dealing, in various ways, with the reality of their minds changing and memories fading. “What could be a more perfect film to work out these issues of memory and talk through them?” Starr said.  Then came casting, a difficult task when working with a class full of outgoing personalities eager for screen time. But the directors agreed that Harry B. Miller, an Emmy-winning set designer who already looks and dresses like Woody Allen, would play Alvy. And Chernick, a self-proclaimed “gypsy,” world traveler and Diane Keaton lookalike, was the perfect Annie.  Initially, Sachs and Starr expected the film to be executed DIY-style, filmed on iPhones with little to no budget. But after seeing the caliber of talent ― and general ebullience ― of the people involved, they decided to think bigger. They’ve now raised almost $7,000 on IndieGogo to help fund the costs of pre- and post-production, including the necessary equipment, location and transportation fees.  Filming had its challenges, but most were logistical rather than personal. “A lot of [the actors] don’t have cell phones,” Starr said. “So we have to call them at 7 in the morning or at 8 at night. Some have email, but are only checking once or twice a day. The communication was difficult.” Another hurdle was the summer heat, brutal for New Yorkers of any age. “Our first day of shooting, we had a 94-year-old in 94-degree heat,” Starr said. “I took it upon myself to have one of those water bottle fans and spray him the entire time.”  Throughout the filming process, Sachs and Starr became best friends with their lead actors. “We go on lots of double dates,” Starr joked. The experience not only strengthened the quality of their collaborative artwork, the directors believe, but illuminated a kind of intergenerational relationship that’s not often experienced.  “I’ve never had friends over 40 years old,” said Starr. “I was only aware of one type of relationship, the one I have with my grandparents.” “You might have one or two older people in your life but you don’t frequently have older people that are friends,” Sachs added. “Because of that, we don’t have access to what it means to be old. Instead we have these pervasive ideas about what it means to be old.” Meeting Miller and Chernick made Sachs and Starr cast their preconceived notions about life post-retirement aside. “Our actors are a lot more active than most of our friends,” Starr said, noting that Miller tap dances, swims and takes Zumba classes regularly.  “I’ve totally decontextualized what it means to age in my head,” Sachs said. “I think it doesn’t have to be such a scary thing. Life can be full of art and love and sex. The people in our class were all dating or had romantic relationships. Just because they’re a certain age, why does that matter? They’re people.” Check out the “My Annie Hall” project on IndieGogo. ",What,be,them
"Bruno Buonaguidi,  Università della Svizzera italiana If you are the owner of a credit or a debit card, there is a non-negligible chance that you may be subject to fraud, like millions of other people around the world. Starting in the 1980s, there has been an impressive increase in the use of credit, debit and pre-paid cards internationally. According to an October 2016 Nilson Report, in 2015 more than US$31 trillion were generated worldwide by these payment systems, up 7.3% from 2014. In 2015, seven in eight purchases in Europe were made electronically. Thanks to new online money-transfer systems, such as Paypal, and the spread of e-commerce around the world – including, increasingly, in the developing world ― which was slow to adopt online payments – these trends are expected to continue. Thanks to leading companies such as Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon India (which together had 80% of the Indian e-commerce market share in 2015) as well as Alibaba and JingDong (which had upwards of 70% of the Chinese market in 2016), electronic payments are reaching massive new consumer populations. This is a goldmine for cybercriminals. According to the Nilson Report, worldwide losses from card fraud rose to US$21 billion in 2015, up from about US$8 billion in 2010. By 2020, that number is expected to reach US$31 billion.  Such costs include, among other expenses, the refunds that banks and credit card companies make to defrauded clients (many banks in the West cap consumers’ liability at US$50 as long as the crime is reported within 30 days for credit cards and within two days for debit cards. This incentivises banks to make significant investments in anti-fraud technologies.   Cybercrime costs vendors in other ways too. They are charged with providing customers with a high standard of security. If they are negligent in this duty, credit card companies may charge them the cost of reimbursing a fraud.    There are many kinds of credit card fraud, and they change so frequently as new technologies enable novel cybercrimes that it’s nearly impossible to list them all.   But there are two main categories:    card-not-present (CNP) frauds: This, the most common kind of fraud, occurs when the cardholder’s information is stolen and used illegally without the physical presence of the card. This kind of fraud usually occurs online, and may be the result of so-called “phishing” emails sent by fraudsters impersonating credible institutions to steal personal or financial information via a contaminated link.  card-present-frauds: This is less common today, but it’s still worth watching out for. It often takes the form of “skimming” – when a dishonest seller swipes a consumer’s credit card into a device that stores the information. Once that data is used to make a purchase, the consumer’s account is charged.    Credit card fraud is facilitated, in part, because credit card transactions are a simple, two-step process: authorisation and settlement.  At the beginning, those involved in the transaction (customer, card issuer, merchant and merchant’s bank) send and receive information to authorise or reject a given purchase. If the purchase is authorised, it is settled by an exchange of money, which usually takes place several days after the authorisation.   Once a purchase had been authorised, there is no going back. That means that all fraud detection measures must be done during in the first step of a transaction. Here’s how it works (in a dramatically simplified fashion). Once companies such as Visa or Mastercard have licensed their brands to a card issuer – a lender like, say, Barclays Bank – and to the merchant’s bank, they fix the terms of the transaction agreement. Then, the card issuer physically delivers the credit card to the consumer. To make a purchase with it, the cardholder gives his card to the vendor (or, online, manually enters the card information), who forwards data on the consumer and the desired purchase to the merchant’s bank. The bank, in turn, routes the required information to the card issuer for analysis and approval – or rejection. The card issuer’s final decision is sent back to both the merchant’s bank and the vendor. Rejection may be issued only in two situations: if the balance on the cardholder’s account is insufficient or if, based on the data provided by the merchant’s bank, there is suspicion of fraud. Incorrect suspicions of fraud is inconvenient for the consumer, whose purchase has been denied and whose card may summarily be blocked by the card issuer, and poses a reputational damage to the vendor. Based on my research, which examines how advanced statistical and probabilistic techniques could better detect fraud, sequential analysis – coupled with new technology – holds the key. Thanks to the continuous monitoring of cardholder expenditure and information – including the time, amount and geographical coordinates of each purchase – it should be possible to develop a computer model that would calculate the probability that a purchase is fraudulent. If the probability passes a certain threshold, the card issuer would be issued an alarm. The company could then decide to either block the card directly or undertake further investigation, such as calling the consumer. The strength of this model, which applies a well-known mathematical theory called optimal stopping theory to fraud detection, is that it aims at either maximising an expected payoff or minimising an expected cost. In other words, all the computations would be aimed at limiting the frequency of false alarms. My research is still underway. But, in the meantime, to reduce significantly the risk of falling victim to credit card fraud, here are some golden rules. First, never click on links in emails that ask you to provide personal information, even if the sender appears to be your bank. Second, before you buy something online from an unknown seller, google the vendor’s name to see whether consumer feedback has been mainly positive. And, finally, when you make online payments, check that the webpage address starts with https://, a communication protocol for secure data transfer, and confirm that the web page does not contain grammatical errors or strange words. That suggests it may be a fake designed solely to steal your financial data.

"  Lower East Side at Dusk. Photo: Jens Schott Knudsen. The Changing Face of the Lower East Side Manhattan's art scene is one that fluctuates and migrates. Watching it over time, it starts to look like a natural process, like herding patterns, or erosion: galleries pop up in neighborhoods where rents are relatively low; attracting more galleries and other businesses; rents rise and property values go up; stalwart, established galleries remain and smaller galleries start to move out, finding lower rents in a different neighborhood; the process then repeats. In the 1950s and 60s the 10th Street Galleries were established as an alternative to 57th Street. In the 1970s it was SoHo. The 1980s ushered in the era of the East Village. In the late 1990s it became all about Chelsea. And most recently, as neighborhood attractions like the Highline and the new Whitney Museum have driven up rents in Chelsea, we've seen more and more of a concentration of galleries on the more-affordable Lower East Side. Between 2010 and 2015 Artnews reported the number of galleries in the neighborhood rose from 71 to 132. Each month seems to bring news of a new gallery opening or relocating to these densely packed streets around the Bowery and Delancey Street, but there have also been major closures--such as Laurel Gitlen Gallery, shuttered in February 2016, after seven years on the Lower East Side. To examine the changing face of the neighborhood, we collected opinions from a selection of galleries--from galleries who began on the Lower East Side, to those who have moved in from other areas, or found a ""second home"" there--on why they opened up shop in the area, how they've seen the neighborhood, business, and their foot traffic change, and what differentiates the LES from other art hubs around New York.    Hales Lower East Side location. Courtesy Hales Gallery. Hales Gallery 64 Delancey Street Opened: March 2016 Hales Gallery is one of the newest to open up on the LES, with an office and viewing gallery serving as this London-based gallery's North American outpost. ""Although we've only just opened, we know the area well. It's interesting to see some of the larger New York galleries open downtown and what the expansion represents in their business. It's also brilliant to see those now establishment galleries, who begun in the area a while back, thrive. The Lower East Side feels like a multifaceted neighborhood, unlike perhaps Chelsea, which though unique in its focus has always been about one thing. In many ways it reminds me of London and specifically the East End - galleries dotted throughout a community with a shifting demographic of businesses and residents. I think all of this feeds off one another and refreshes the context for art to be viewed. ""With the increased rents in other parts of the city it's interesting to see what will happen in the existing art neighborhoods and indeed where next will become a hub. I'm keen to see what 'growth' and 'expansion' means within the LES as it can't really equate to square footage due to the infrastructure. I think this is a good thing as with galleries in other areas getting bigger by the minute hopefully those on the LES with continue their somewhat positively different ethos and approach."" -Stuart Morrison, Director, Hales Gallery    Danziger Gallery. Courtesy Danziger Gallery. Danziger Gallery 95 Rivington Street Opened: February 2016 A leading gallery devoted to photography, Danziger Gallery first opened in SoHo in 1989, moved to Upper East Side in 1996, then to Chelsea in 2004. ""Rising rents and the over-saturation of art in Chelsea"" contributed to Danziger Gallery's decision to relocate to the LES. ""Chelsea seems fatigued and the LES seems vibrant and neighborly. It is a mixed-use area. Galleries, restaurants, stores, tattoo studios. And no howling wind off the Hudson. ""The gallery business, like the world, is constantly changing. Foot traffic is less important for sales as the internet and art fairs become sales drivers. However the gallery still plays an important role in providing an in-depth look and context for the art and artists we represent."" -James Danziger    Eugene Von Bruenchenhein, King of Lesser Lands, installation view, Andrew Edlin Gallery, March 24 - May 8, 2016.

Andrew Edlin Gallery 212 Bowery Opened: December 2015 Andrew Edlin Gallery, which focuses on self-taught artists like Eugene von Bruenchenhein and Henry Darger, moved to the LES from Chelsea last year. ""Our building in Chelsea was being razed for new condo development. On the Lower East Side, the 212 Bowery address had magic to it, fantastic location... The neighborhood has been changing with new construction projects up and down Bowery, but the LES still has some edge to it, a street vibe compared to other art neighborhoods."" -Andrew Edlin    Concept, Performance, Documentation, Language, installation view with works by Tehching Tsieh, David Wojnarovicz, Duff Scheninger, Jack Smith, Neke Carson, Vito Acconci, Mitchell Algus Gallery, February 20 - May 1, 2016.

Mitchell Algus Gallery 132 Delancey Street, 2nd floor Opened: January 2015 Mitchell Algus opened his first gallery in SoHo in 1992, moved to Chelsea in 2002, and then opened a joint venture, in 2010, Algus Greenspon, in the West Village, which he operated with Amy Greenspon. Algus opened an independent exhibition space on the Lower East Side early last year. ""The neighborhood is changing rapidly. Condos, Essex Crossing, gangs of young people roaming the streets at night. The quality of the art is all over the place (which is not necessarily a bad thing). What I mean is that there are numerous crappy galleries because the rents have (for the time being) been affordable. There are also many young galleries which are getting their act together and that means quality is all over the place with lots of student-y work. None of that bothers me. There are some quality eccentric spaces. And there are a few (not many) really good galleries, but it is not like Chelsea where all the 'good galleries' show it with the 'power', attitude and obvious cost of their spaces. The mix is good here and if you know what you are looking at, it's easy to figure out. If you don't know what you're looking at, so be it."" -Mitchell Algus    Juliana Cerqueira Leite, Intransitive, installation view, Regina Rex, February 28 - April 10, 2016. Courtesy Regina Rex. Regina Rex 221 Madison Street Opened: August 2014 Artist-run space Regina Rex was founded in Bushwick, Brooklyn, in 2010, and moved to a space down on the southern end of the Lower East Side in 2014. ""Rent here was comparatively affordable and easy to arrange, actually much more so than Brooklyn, which was (and is) under such speculative development that acquiring a space at a rate we could sustain was highly unlikely. This stretch of the Lower East Side feels, in the best way, like much of the neighborhood did ten years ago--filled with bodegas, salons, franchises and small businesses. It's live, vital, and inhabited by large Chinese and Hispanic populations. When we moved, there were already many spaces in the LES with untraditional gallery models like CANADA, Abrons Art Center, Reena Spaulings, Beverly's and others, so it felt like a natural place for us to land, and broaden our audience. Definitely, more restaurants, bars and galleries have moved southward. But compared to areas northward, we are surrounded by a lot more low-income and affordable housing units and co-ops, which hopefully will result in the preservation of the economic and racial diversity that makes the neighborhood typical of the 'garden' of New York. The LES has such a rich cultural history, and that has attracted artists to the neighborhood for years. So it definitely feels more integrated than other art hubs as a place where artists, not only exhibit, but live, work, eat and drink."" -Katherine Aungier and Max Warsh of Regina Rex    Scott Alario, Ecstatic Consumption, installation view, Kristen Lorello, March 17 - May 1, 2016.

Kristen Lorello 195 Chrystie Street, #600A, 6th floor Opened: April 2014 On the 6th floor of a building right behind the New Museum, Kristen Lorello is one of the most diminutive exhibition spaces in Manhattan (about 165 square feet). The lack of space is more than made up for by a robust program of young artists. ""When I decided to open my own gallery, I knew I wanted it to be located within Manhattan. When I began looking for a space, I walked around extensively on the Lower East Side and in Chelsea. Since I knew I would be showing artists who were in the early stages of their New York careers, I felt that the Lower East Side would be the best choice. The rents in the LES were more manageable than in Chelsea and I thought the neighborhood would attract collectors looking to discover artists. I'm very happy in the neighborhood. [Concerning foot traffic], for me, meeting people at art fairs and nurturing relationships with different collectors, curators, and advisors has been the driving factor in selling works. My gallery is turning two this month and people are coming in each day. This was not the case in my first year of business, so it is exciting that foot traffic is gradually continuing to increase. ""I think that in general, the galleries in the LES have a somewhat intimate feel to them as well as a generally friendly vibe. For those who are just beginning to collect, this is a great neighborhood to venture to, as many galleries are showing works in an affordable price range. In turn, the neighborhood also offers seasoned collectors a chance to discover new artists and to support younger galleries who they would like to see succeed."" -Kristen Lorello    On Stellar Rays' new space, 213 Bowery, which will open April 10th with an exhibition by John Houck, Playing and Reality, April 10 - May 22, 2016. Courtesy On Stellar Rays. On Stellar Rays 1 Rivington Street, 213 Bowery Opened: October 2008 On Stellar Rays has long been one of the beacons on the Lower East Side. This month, they expand at their 1 Rivington address, opening a new, ground-floor space in the same building. ""On Stellar Rays opened in October 2008--right on the heels of the financial meltdown. The gallery actually opened one day after Lehman Brothers announced bankruptcy. The timing, while challenging, afforded the gallery the opportunity to take more risks with programming--showcasing video, performance, and sculptural installations--a defining characteristic of the gallery that carries through to today. The LES was the logical neighborhood for the gallery to open because the rents were among the most affordable options at the time. The opening of the New Museum certainly propelled a lot of the movement downtown as well. On Stellar Rays has a dedicated core audience visiting regularly, but we are very excited to expand our reach with an imminent move to the ground floor on April 10. This move to a storefront space on the corner of Rivington and Bowery, steps from the New Museum, provides our artists with a more visible and flexible opportunity to realize their projects. We are doubling our gallery square footage, and as a result, our capacity to provide dialogue and experimentation via talks, screenings, performances, discursive events, and partnerships with other arts organizations. ""The neighborhood is certainly more active all times of the day now, and I see this dynamic only expanding in the months to come. We are in the company of several friends' galleries, just within a few steps down the block. Our friend Andrew Edlin recently moved directly across the street, and we look forward to opening of the International Center of Photography a block north. I feel that the next phase of change will coincide with the opening of hotels around either corner from us. The programming at LES galleries is more experimental and risk-taking, and we do not see that changing anytime soon. Galleries live side-by-side with a dynamic and thriving creative community, and are not as silo-ed off as other art hub areas tend to be."" -Kristen Wawruck, Director   --Natalie Hegert

"FRANKFORT, Ky. ― Thousands of teachers and public workers from across Kentucky flocked to the state Capitol on Monday morning to protest potential budget cuts to public education and the passage, last week, of a controversial package of changes to the state’s public pension system that teachers had opposed. The rally began before 9 a.m. outside the Kentucky Education Association building just blocks from the Capitol complex. Teachers, most of them clad in red (as part of the grassroots Wear Red for Ed campaign), later marched to the Capitol itself, filling up the rotunda outside legislative chambers and spilling out the front doors and down the steps. “Enough is enough,” they chanted, many of them carrying signs telling lawmakers to fully fund their pensions and their schools and threatening that if the legislators failed to do so, the teachers would do everything in their power to remove them from office in elections this November. “We feel demoralized, we feel assaulted and we feel like we’ve been marginalized,” said Chris Wilder, a teacher at Anderson County High School in Lawrenceburg. “We’re angry.” Teachers have filled the Capitol complex off and on for more than a month in an effort to derail pension changes and education budget cuts proposed by Republican Gov. Matt Bevin and Republican majority leaders in both chambers of the legislature. But their anger boiled over Thursday night when GOP lawmakers attached a slate of pension changes to a previously unrelated bill meant to address public sewage issues. Hours later, both the state House and state Senate approved the measures on party-line votes. “The way they introduced this bill was the linchpin, the insulting part,” Wilder said. “We’re basically equivalent to excrement. It’s like, ‘This is what we think of you and your contribution to our state. Nothing. You don’t matter.’ But we matter, and our kids matter.” The pension bill, which Bevin is expected to sign before the legislative session ends next week, did not contain some provisions teachers had been most angry about, including a cap on annual cost-of-living adjustments. The bill dropped many of the previously proposed changes to current teachers’ benefits. But it maintained a provision that places a cap on the number of a current teacher’s accumulated sick days that can count toward pension benefits ― a move Attorney General Andy Beshear, who said he would sue if the bill becomes law, has said is unconstitutional. It also switches new hires to a “hybrid” 401(k)-style plan and ends some contractual protections that currently prohibit lawmakers from altering pension benefits for public workers, teachers included. Those changes, teachers said, would make it hard for the state to recruit new educators in Kentucky, which already has a struggling public education system. Even before Monday’s rally, teachers forced public schools to close in at least 25 Kentucky counties on Friday when they called in sick en masse to protest the pension plan. In Lexington, the state’s second-largest school district, more than one-third of school employees stayed out Friday. In Louisville, the absences forced the closure of Kentucky’s largest school district. Most public school districts were already closed Monday for spring break, but the threat of another round of sick-outs caused more than a dozen school districts that were supposed to be open to close instead. The result was that public school districts were shuttered in each of Kentucky’s 120 counties on Monday, accomplishing a goal organizers had set when they announced plans for the protest. KENTUCKY IS OFFICIALLY #120STRONG. MCCREARY COUNTY JUST CALLED OFF AT 10 P.M. NO county school district will be in session tomorrow. MAP KEY -- RED = Called off for rally/sick, GREEN = Spring Break. LET'S GO! pic.twitter.com/RibSAvPPaJ The educators came to Frankfort from cities across the state. In Louisville, a group of Jefferson County Public School teachers met at a local Teamsters union hall and took a 45-minute bus ride to the capital. In Frankfort, groups of teachers gathered under banners bearing names of school districts spread from Pike County in eastern Kentucky to Marshall County in the west. The initial crowd for the bus ride from Louisville disappointed some organizers. They had planned for four full busloads but sent three half-full buses instead. But upon arriving in Frankfort, it was clear that the crowd had exceeded expectations. Organizers estimated that more than 5,000 people gathered inside and outside the Capitol, though no official estimate was available. “This is spring break,” said Mike Kral, a retired teacher from Hardin County. “If it’d been a regular school day, it’d have been 10 times this.” Still, it was a show of force against a state legislature that, teachers said, has failed to prioritize teachers or Kentucky’s public education system for years and, by passing the pension package so quickly Thursday, had broken a promise to its educators. “When we signed on the dotted line to become a teacher, we knew we weren’t going to make a lot of money,” said Lynn Luking, a retired teacher from Louisville. “But we were promised a full pension and full health care. And every year they’ve taken more and more of that away.” The protests weren’t aimed only at last week’s pension overhaul. With the end of Kentucky’s legislative session looming, lawmakers returned to the capital Monday to consider new tax legislation and a budget bill that held the potential for further cuts to public education spending. Bevin, in January, had proposed cuts to several school-related programs in ways that some administrators said threatened the solvency of some poorer, rural districts. Many of the teachers also opposed potential new funding for charter schools that Bevin had pushed in his proposed budget. “It seems like these folks want to privatize everything,” said Mike Haile, a retired teacher from Henderson County, in western Kentucky. “They privatized prisons and they privatized schools. It’s take the money and run.” With the budget vote looming, a crowd of protesters gathered around a side entrance to the Capitol and chanted “Shame! Shame!” at Republican lawmakers as they entered.  Republicans ultimately introduced a bill that did not include many of Bevin’s preferred cuts or new funding for charter schools, according to the Louisville Courier-Journal, though many protesters and legislative Democrats still criticized it for cutting taxes on the rich and falling short of previous K-12 education funding levels.  Total, inflation-adjusted SEEK (the state funding formula for K-12 education) is cut again under the final budget agreement - 16 percent compared to 2008 levels. #kyga18 pic.twitter.com/Sr6JFylaA6 The protests and school closures were reminiscent of similar movements in states including West Virginia, where teachers went on strike to protest years of tax cuts that had left the state unable to fully fund schools, and Oklahoma, where teachers were set to go on strike Monday. Teachers in Arizona could soon join them in walking out. In Kentucky, the educators said the pension changes and budget cuts were a breaking point in their relationship with state government. They vowed that the protests and organized opposition would continue. And they promised that they would be a political force come November. “I will walk and knock on every door,” Luking said, “to see that every one of these guys are defeated.” Clarification: This piece has been updated to clarify that the pension legislation included a change to the way sick days are calculated into retirement plans for current teachers. ",Bevin,opposed,budget
"Will Ferrell was taken to a hospital Thursday night after an SUV he was riding in flipped during a freeway collision. The car carrying the actor was side-swiped by a sedan on I-5 near Laguna Hills, California, and ended up spinning and then rolling over, TMZ reported. Capt. Larry Kurtz of the Orange County Fire Authority wouldn’t reveal the names of the passengers in the SUV, but he confirmed to HuffPost that the vehicle carried three men in their 40s to 50s and one woman in her 20s. The three men were taken to area hospitals to be checked for minor injuries, while the woman, who was bleeding profusely, was transported to a local trauma center, Kurtz said. Video obtained by TMZ shows firefighters lifting Ferrell into an ambulance while he talks on his cellphone. United Talent Agency, which represents Ferrell, released this statement about the accident later on Friday: While traveling back to Los Angeles after hosting a voter registration event in San Diego, a car carrying Will Ferrell and three of his colleagues was struck on the freeway by another vehicle. Will and his colleague, Andrew Steele, were unhurt and have been released from an Orange County hospital. Will’s longtime driver, Mark Thompson, and his other colleague Carolina Barlow remain hospitalized in stable condition.  Will is staying close by as his friends are being treated, and has expressed his deep gratitude to the first responders who were immediately at the scene and to the hospital team that took such great care of them. He’s also grateful for all the well wishes he and his friends are receiving. California Highway Patrol spokesman Rafael Reynoso told The Hollywood Reporter that neither alcohol nor drugs are suspected in the crash. He also said no citation or arrests have been made. Ferrell was reportedly returning from a Funny or Die event that he did with comedian Billy Eichner in Oceanside, California. The event, called “Glam Up the Midterms,” is the first of a series designed to inspire young voters, who often don’t vote in midterm elections, to participate this go-around, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. Ferrell dressed as his legendary anchorman character Ron Burgundy at the event. This story has been updated with a statement from Ferrell’s management company United Talent Agency. #GlamUpTheMidterms thank you @billyeichner for an informative evening and nonstop laughter.

"By Joel Schectman, Dustin Volz and Jack Stubbs Western technology companies, including Cisco, IBM and SAP, are acceding to demands by Moscow for access to closely guarded product security secrets, at a time when Russia has been accused of a growing number of cyber attacks on the West, a Reuters investigation has found. Russian authorities are asking Western tech companies to allow them to review source code for security products such as firewalls, anti-virus applications and software containing encryption before permitting the products to be imported and sold in the country. The requests, which have increased since 2014, are ostensibly done to ensure foreign spy agencies have not hidden any “backdoors” that would allow them to burrow into Russian systems. But those inspections also provide the Russians an opportunity to find vulnerabilities in the products’ source code - instructions that control the basic operations of computer equipment - current and former U.S. officials and security experts said. While a number of U.S. firms say they are playing ball to preserve their entree to Russia’s huge tech market, at least one U.S. firm, Symantec, told Reuters it has stopped cooperating with the source code reviews over security concerns. That halt has not been previously reported. Symantec said one of the labs inspecting its products was not independent enough from the Russian government. U.S. officials say they have warned firms about the risks of allowing the Russians to review their products’ source code, because of fears it could be used in cyber attacks. But they say they have no legal authority to stop the practice unless the technology has restricted military applications or violates U.S. sanctions. From their side, companies say they are under pressure to acquiesce to the demands from Russian regulators or risk being shut out of a lucrative market. The companies say they only allow Russia to review their source code in secure facilities that prevent code from being copied or altered. (Graphic on source code review process: tmsnrt.rs/2sZudWT) The demands are being made by Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), which the U.S. government says took part in the cyber attacks on Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the 2014 hack of 500 million Yahoo email accounts. The FSB, which has denied involvement in both the election and Yahoo hacks, doubles as a regulator charged with approving the sale of sophisticated technology products in Russia. The reviews are also conducted by the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control (FSTEC), a Russian defense agency tasked with countering cyber espionage and protecting state secrets. Records published by FSTEC and reviewed by Reuters show that from 1996 to 2013, it conducted source code reviews as part of approvals for 13 technology products from Western companies. In the past three years alone it carried out 28 reviews. A Kremlin spokesman referred all questions to the FSB. The FSB did not respond to requests for comment. FSTEC said in a statement that its reviews were in line with international practice. The U.S. State Department declined to comment. Moscow’s source code requests have mushroomed in scope since U.S.-Russia relations went into a tailspin following the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, according to eight current and former U.S. officials, four company executives, three U.S. trade attorneys and Russian regulatory documents. In addition to IBM, Cisco and Germany’s SAP, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co and McAfee have also allowed Russia to conduct source code reviews of their products, according to people familiar with the companies’ interactions with Moscow and Russian regulatory records. Until now, little has been known about that regulatory review process outside of the industry. The FSTEC documents and interviews with those involved in the reviews provide a rare window into the tense push-and-pull between technology companies and governments in an era of mounting alarm about hacking. Roszel Thomsen, an attorney who helps U.S. tech companies navigate Russia import laws, said the firms must balance the dangers of revealing source code to Russian security services against possible lost sales. “Some companies do refuse,” he said. “Others look at the potential market and take the risk.” If tech firms do decline the FSB’s source code requests, then approval for their products can be indefinitely delayed or denied outright, U.S. trade attorneys and U.S. officials said. The Russian information technology market is expected to be worth $18.4 billion this year, according to market researcher International Data Corporation (IDC). Six current and former U.S. officials who have dealt with companies on the issue said they are suspicious about Russia’s motives for the expanded reviews. “It’s something we have a real concern about,” said a former senior Commerce Department official who had direct knowledge of the interaction between U.S. companies and Russian officials until he left office this year. “You have to ask yourself what it is they are trying to do, and clearly they are trying to look for information they can use to their advantage to exploit, and that’s obviously a real problem.” However, none of the officials who spoke to Reuters could point to specific examples of hacks or cyber espionage that were made possible by the review process. Source code requests are not unique to Russia. In the United States, tech companies allow the government to audit source code in limited instances as part of defense contracts and other sensitive government work. China sometimes also requires source code reviews as a condition to import commercial software, U.S. trade attorneys say. The reviews often takes place in secure facilities known as “clean rooms.” Several of the Russian companies that conduct the testing for Western tech companies on behalf of Russian regulators have current or previous links to the Russian military, according to their websites. Echelon, a Moscow-based technology testing company, is one of several independent FSB-accredited testing centers that Western companies can hire to help obtain FSB approval for their products. Echelon CEO Alexey Markov told Reuters his engineers review source code in special laboratories, controlled by the companies, where no software data can be altered or transferred.   Markov said Echelon is a private and independent company but does have a business relationship with Russia’s military and law enforcement authorities. Echelon’s website touts medals it was awarded in 2013 by Russia’s Ministry of Defense for “protection of state secrets.” The company’s website also sometimes refers to Markov as the “Head of Attestation Center of the Ministry of Defense.” In an email, Markov said that title is only intended to convey Echelon’s role as a certified outside tester of military technology testing. The medals were generic and insignificant, he said. But for Symantec, the lab “didn’t meet our bar” for independence, said spokeswoman Kristen Batch. “In the case of Russia, we decided the protection of our customer base through the deployment of uncompromised security products was more important than pursuing an increase in market share in Russia,” said Batch, who added that the company did not believe Russia had tried to hack into its products. In 2016, the company decided it would no longer use third parties, including Echelon, that have ties to a foreign state or get most of their revenue from government-mandated security testing. “It poses a risk to the integrity of our products that we are not willing to accept,” she said. Without the source code approval, Symantec can no longer get approval to sell some of its business-oriented security products in Russia. “As a result, we do minimal business there,” she said. Markov declined to comment on Symantec’s decision, citing a non-disclosure agreement with the company. Over the past year, HP has used Echelon to allow FSTEC to review source code, according to the agency’s records. A company spokesman declined to comment.       An IBM spokesman confirmed the company allows Russia to review its source code in secure, company-controlled facilities “where strict procedures are followed.” FSTEC certification records showed the Information Security Center, an independent testing company based outside Moscow, has reviewed IBM’s source code on behalf of the agency. The company was founded more than 20 years ago under the auspices of an institute within Russia’s Ministry of Defense, according to its website. The company did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, McAfee said the Russia code reviews were conducted  at “certified testing labs” at company-owned premises in the United States. SAP allows Russia to review and test source code in a secure SAP facility in Germany, according to a person familiar with the process. In a company statement, SAP said the review process assures Russian customers “their SAP software investments are safe and secure.” Cisco has recently allowed Russia to review source code, according to a person familiar with the matter. A Cisco spokeswoman declined to comment on the company’s interactions with Russian authorities but said the firm does sometimes allow regulators to inspect small parts of its code in “trusted” independent labs and that the reviews do not compromise the security of its products. Before allowing the reviews, Cisco scrutinizes the code to ensure they are not exposing vulnerabilities that could be used to hack the products, she said.
